We may try to detect the sentiment of a review by trying to predict its score or find how useful a review was for other users. All of these can be done through supervised learning since we already have the dataset \"labeled\" by the metadata mentioned above, like the score and the number of users who claimed that a review was helpful and those who claimed the opposite."

A great second Part. I highly recommend this film. I love all 3 films. I loved this film. One of the best superhero films out there. If you are a DVD collector(Like me) then you should add this to your collection. It is that good. The acting is good. It has some humor. It has action and romance so Males and females will enjoy it.
