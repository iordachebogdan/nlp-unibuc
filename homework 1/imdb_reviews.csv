0,Moon,Amazing Throwback Sci-Fi,"There is little that I can do by way of review. There is a minor REVEAL a third of the way through that, though it would not ruin the movie, would ruin some of the cumulative effect of the subtly clever tale. Sam Rockwell plays Sam (for some reason I love it when that happens) who is a one man show on a moon mining base for a Big Energy Company. He signed a three year contract and he is two weeks away from going home to his wife and small child. Kevin Spacey's voice gives life to GERTY, the helpful corporate robot. GERTY expresses himself with emoticons which are chuckle inducing. The brilliance is that writer/director Duncan Jones (son of rock idol Davey Jones. No, not that Davey Jones, but rather the one that took the stage name of David Bowie {which makes Jones' movie taking place in space... OK, nevermin}) lays delicate red herrings at various points where the viewer is suddenly convinced that it is going to be THAT type of movi... er, no, I mean OK, we saw that in 2001 it... er, no, that's like Solar... hmm. As I mentioned, The Reveal comes pretty early, but this is not a M. Knight movie, so The Reveal is not what drives the film. After The Reveal the movies turns into a quiet and contemplative commentary, maybe, or perhaps an extensional wrapped philosophical study. I'm not sure, actually, which is why the movie stays with you. It allows one to read quite a bit between gratuitously wide-spaced lines, take it at face value, or approach it in the abstract. It is more ambiguous in its purpose than something like 2001 which was purposely extensional and ambiguous, if that makes any sense. I must also add that the movie made me very, very sad. It's hard to explain why for the movie did not have a classic ""sad ending,"" but the effect that it had on me bordered on profound. This is by far my favorite movie in a long while. And lastly, Sam Rockwell was absolutely amazing. The fact that my anticipation was so high for the film and still did not disappoint probably means it is even better than I am claiming. Do yourself a favor though: If it plays near you, go see it. 10/10 *****/***** Three Thumbs Up and a Bucket of Popcorn",10.0,drunkenhopfrog,2009/07/24,41,27
1,The Chorus,Marvellous - Please do not remake in English!!,"I recorded this on my Sky Plus box out of curiosity, because I had heard good things about it. Those good things were more than justified. I have never really enjoyed subtitled movies and I am sure I miss a lot of good stuff because of my prejudice against them. However I started watching this and was totally enthralled within minutes. Jugnot's performance was superb and the whole thing was wonderfully uplifting and, dare I say it, I was blubbing like a baby at certain points (usually musical) during the movie. While the story has parallels in other films (Mr Hollands Opus, Dead Poets Society - to name a couple)it still resonated as an original treatment. The main character is not a charismatic, handsome type but he carries the story and he should have got an Oscar as should the score. Cannot finish without mentioning the young actor who played Morhange-he has a haunting, beautiful face (the face of an angel they say in the film) and a terrific voice. All round great performances, script, direction and music. I do not give it 10 out of 10 only for the fact that it has subtitles-how shallow of me!! However I do not want to see it dubbed or remade as a slick Hollywood treatment!!",10.0,beresfordjd,2006/05/01,4,3
2,The Green Mile,Crap !,"Hard to believe that so many people seem to believe that this cheesy movie is a masterpiece or even the best film they've ever seen. I borrowed the DVD recently and I seriously can't remember having seen a worse picture from beginning to end in quite some time. Everything about it is phony, predictable, stereotyped and contrived.A corny pseudo-moral tale that can be embraced by everyone who enjoys being manipulated in the crudest way. To go into details about all the flaws this movie has to offer is not worth the time, I already wasted more than three hours watching it. If you like to entertain yourself with a film worth watching, pick up something else.",1.0,Doc-Zucker,2006/04/17,137,40
3,Detachment,"A touching, thought provoking masterpiece","Wow, was not expecting that! Popped into the cinema on may home from work. I knew absolutely noting about that this film apart from the director gave us one of the best movies ever made in American History X. I've seen some amazing films this year, Ill Manors, Café Flore & Shame but this is by far the best of the lot. There's no need to tell you what the film is about as everyone else has already done that. But what I can say is anyone with a soul, depth & compassion will relate this movie on so many levels. (I was constantly wiping away the tears from my face) You're gripped from the opening scene in which you feel like you're having a one on one conversation with the brilliant Adrien Brody. It's incredibly intimate and touching. This is by no means a film on depression but does touch upon the struggles of day to day life in all forms of society, with the subtext being it's going to be alright. There's a light at the end of all the tunnel, keep going and your light will shine. I've lost friends to suicide and heroin and wish both of these amazing people shared that optimism. The cast is fantastic and brilliantly acted. (Why wasn't Brody nominated for an Oscar?) The chemistry between Brody and the beautiful Erica played by a newbie who will surely be around for years to come is superb, in fact, it reminded me of the relationship between Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murrey in Lost in Translation. The film is broken up with dreamy visions of Brody as a boy, and chalk board animations. These enhanced the film emotionally. Few films can touch you deeply and stay with you but this does. In the words of Matt Johnson from The The If you can't change the world, then change yourself, if you can't change yourself, then change your world.",10.0,darren-153-890810,2012/07/18,6,4
4,Detachment,Best Movie of 2011,"Saw this at a local film festival with little to no information about the movie whatsoever; little did I know this was going to become my favorite film of the year, and that's saying a lot given that 2011 has been a blast for moviegoers with new products by Woody Allen, Terrence Malick, Lars Von Trier and Clint Eastwood. The movie revolves around an poignant substitute teacher (perfectly played by Adrien Brody) who arrives at a vicious school, where students go around bullying people (including the teachers) and basically throwing their lives directly to the dumpster you know, teenage angst and such I didn't grow up in the USA, so two important things I must say, a) I don't know if this is an accurate depiction of any given school in America and b) I can't relate with the overall chronicle, which brings me to my next point. The beauty of this movie comes within the subtext, whether you can directly relate with the characters or not, the movie takes the message and widens its range so everyone is able to understand the actual meaning of the film. Let's clear things out, this film is not about a school or the basis of education, this is about trying our best not to give a damn about others as most of us just go around doing everything in our power to be happy ourselves with a lousy job, a loveless marriage, a constant sense of abandonment or basically a crappy life (all of the above portrayed marvelously in the film). Films by Tony Kaye tend to be really visceral with a thin slice of optimism in the undertones, I think this time he just went mental about everything, in the end you'll leave the theater with a slight sense of hopelessness, almost as if you're destined to watch daily misery without the power to control anything but your own life, as if the only battle you must fight is the constant reminder that even when everything falls apart and slowly turns into dust, you can't change the world, you just have to avoid the world from changing you This exposed stunningly in the final sequence of the movie. Do yourself a favor, watch this film!",10.0,feguiza,2011/11/27,312,274
5,Pulp Fiction,Wow! Just wow!,"I absolutely love this film. Around 5 or 6 years old, I remember looking thought my mom's VHS collection and ran across the jewel. I asked her if I could watch it, and she told me that I was too young to see it. Several years later, I remember seeing the Mia Wallace and Vincent Vega storyline on the USA station and immediately was drawn in. Even at a young age, I was intrigued with the film. Years later, I saw the full film, and wow!!! Such an amazing movie! I'm a huge fan of Quentin Tarantino films, but Pulp Fiction is by far my favorite. With a stellar cast, amazing soundtrack, and simple but unique plot, this movie is miles ahead of many.",10.0,destiniem,2020/04/16,9,7
6,The Chorus,Love and courage in education,"Mr. Mathieu communicated with the students like this: Mathieu asked the children to write their names, ages, and ideal careers on a small piece of paper. The student Pépinot did not know what to write. Only a big warm hand rested lightly on the boy's shoulder, and he patiently and gently asked ... What is teacher-student equality? What is the children's position? That's it. One shot and one picture is enough. I think Mathieu is a teacher of all teachers. What he brings is not only educational skills, techniques and strategies. The most important thing he teaches us is courage: the courage to love, the courage to education and the courage to change.",9.0,IreneWatsonC,2020/03/20,0,0
7,Moon,"Wow, just Wow...","Possibly the best sci-fi film I have ever seen. Gripping from beginning to end, full of tension, fascinating, heart-wrenching, and certainly not predictable. Elements of Silent Running (another favourite) and 2001: A Space Odyssey, but stands alone. Completely breathtaking and beautifully understated. Really that sums it up, but to meet word count requirements: Spoilers follow - Sam Rockwell as the Sams' was just stunning - so completely convincing, and beautifully portraying their uniqueness in their sameness. Kevin Spacey was also just perfect as Gerty (what a great name). The music was spot on too. 'kick me' :-) Love it.",10.0,caitlin_online,2010/01/03,10,5
8,The Fault in Our Stars,"A ""Sick love story""","This review is originally from my blog Derpy Reviews, [URL] to see more FioS news, reviews and giveaways, email subscribe to Derpy Reviews and friend me on GoodReads [URL] The Fault in our Stars, where to start. Great book, fantastic movie. The emotion of the actors made John Greens New York Times Best Seller, real. They brought depth to our pages, they brought emotion to our dripping eyes, and they brought warmth to our hearts. The movie is about a teenage girl who has terminal lung cancer, she was saved by a experimental treatment when she was younger. Now as she is older, her parents feel that she is suffering from depression which is, as Hazel describes it a ""side affect of dying."" Her parents encourage her to go to a cancer support group where she meets Agustus Waters, ex-cancer carrier and minus one leg. Soon Hazel and Gus find themselves head over heels planning to love each other until oblivion ultimately catches up with them. A ""sick love story"" The actors casted for these roles were amazing. Shailene, played Hazel flawlessly, she was smart, and funny and cold just as Hazel was. Ansel, was equally amazing, his amazing humor and timing made this movie! The amazing actors and actresses combined with the entire crew, the way the movie was filmed is just inviting, and they way text messages and emails were displayed will start a new movie trend. Some call it a tear jerker, some revolutionary, but me, I call it a spectacularly made masterpiece. You will laugh and you will cry. And some parts will send those magical shivers down your spine. I would recommend this movie to... Any reader of the Fault in our Stars Anyone looking for a fantastic movie A guy who wants a romantic movie for two, that he may enjoy himself A girl who wants to just cry through an entire movie Someone who wants to see a spectacularly made masterpiece ""Okay""",9.0,jfischer-8-534134,2014/05/23,146,81
9,The Fault in Our Stars,Luckily...,"Just what I've written in the title... LUCKILY I didn't follow my friends to the cinema for this movie. It would just be a waste of money. Well, I eventually came over this movie and suddenly got interested in watching this movie, and so I did... I sat in front of my laptop, expecting to cry my hearts out but halfway through the movie I got BORED!!! I sat there wondering whether I've got a heart made of stone. But hey! I watched several movies that had left me crying my eyes out(At this point i recommend Miracle in Cell No.7). Well, maybe the relationship between Hazel and her mother got me a bit teary eyed but I am proud to say, NOT a tear was shed! Btw, the plot is just... OLD. Somebody in a relationship is dying, and then he or she starts rejecting the other, for fear that it would bring pain and suffering to the other, however, starts to realize that her time is running out and eventually accept the other and starts to spend as much time with him, cherish their time together... blah blah blah and finally die. I have not read John Green's book but I can't help but think that this kind of plot just keeps getting recycled by movies, producers, writers... I don't even know what to say anymore...(Maybe the book is better? Book readers? I just don't know) And seriously, what's with the kiss in Anne Frank's house?! And the guys are even clapping?! It's a good thing that the actual house denied the filming of this movie. Or else it would be a GREAT disrespect to Anne Frank. Towards the end of the movie and I started to get tired and sleepy. I was constantly checking the remaining time of the movie. That's how boring it is... So guys, words of advice, wanna find heart breaking, comedy romance, go elsewhere, you can fine none here... And it is damn BORING!!! But hey! On the good side, The Fault in Our Stars got my first review!! Congrats!",1.0,yiwen-96,2015/03/05,7,4
10,Goodfellas,The Ultimate Gangster Film,"Goodfellas is the type of movie that has it all. Action, thriller, suspense and even some comedy thrown in makes this epic film the best of it's kind. The pace of this film is brilliant. There is no dull scene, no fillers and it leaves you completely entertained from start to finish. Joe Pesci is absolutely amazing and deserved the Oscar no question. You don't even have to be a person that likes gangster films to appreciate Goodfellas. If you were one of the people that found The Godfather to be a little slow or boring at times, I highly recommend this film as a substitute ""mafia"" film. You will definitely get your money's worth if you rent this one. Best film of the 90's without a doubt.",10.0,seventhsamurai1954,2005/08/04,32,20
11,Blackfish,The human inhumanity,"Let's go to the theme park to see the Orcas. Playful, interacting with their trainers who swim with them carefree it is a guaranteed spectacle and fun time. Do we ever consider, that these intelligent creatures spent a lifetime enclosed in a large bathtub so that we can be entertained? Imagine going to see a show of children ballerinas knowing that those children spent their entire lives locked up in a room when not performing. Would anyone stand for this? Surely not, I would hope. This riveting and didactic documentary explores the owner's attitudes when occasionally those animals flip out and act in an aggressive way. It is always the trainers fault, or the bad manners of the animals. In fact, it appears that those who run those theme parks have gone out of their way to hide the truth which is those who work with killer whales are in great risk. The death of a long-time and renowned trainer brought the issue to the surface where enquiries had to be made. We might be better informed about the risks involved but the rather lax legislature regarding animal rights allows these companies to still operate and oppress animals in an inhuman way. Well made and runs high on emotion, it will make the viewer contemplate on the scale of human tyrannism.",,cinematic_aficionado,2013/07/30,155,142
12,Ferris Bueller's Day Off,Refreshing Hughes teen flick one of his best,"Teen flick king John Hughes is writer/director for this escapist movie about how high school kids should try not to let life pass them by in the prime of their youth. A great boppy soundtrack which includes Yello's ""Oh Yeah"" and ""Twist and Shout"" from the Beatles accompanies Matthew Broderick's refreshing turn as the excessively confident and immensely popular young Ferris. He is perfectly cast, as is Mia Sara, the attractive girlfriend, and Alan Ruck, Ferris' ever paranoid and worrying friend Cameron who supplies the trio with their 'choice' transport, a 1961 Ferrari 250 GT California. Also great value are Jeffrey Jones as the Dean of Students from hell who is determined to catch Ferris, and Jennifer Grey as the insanely jealous sister with an attitude. Charlie Sheen drops by with a cameo as a drug fiend with some friendly advice. While one of Hughes' best teen comedies, the movie still has his trademark misplaced scenes. Much of the attempts at drama are corny, the serious moments don't work and any moral messages fall flat. ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" works best sending itself and other films up. Some very clever comedy is evident and Hughes produces some hilarious scenes including two terrific running gags involving firstly an over the top ""Save Ferris"" campaign and secondly a little tune called ""Auf Wiedersehn"". Broderick talks to the camera through much of the film which proves to be relatively effective. Friday, May 19, 1995 - Video",6.0,gcd70,2008/02/08,3,2
13,Blackfish,Gut Wrenching,"This documentary is one of the best docs I've ever seen. Tilikum, the Orca who is the film's focus, is not the only tragic victim in this movie. We feel the loss of Dawn Brancheau & the other trainers killed in this movie acutely. There are scenes of wild orcas that are rapturous & conversely there are scenes with them that are filled with tension & dread. The filmmakers aren't out to shock you with graphic imagery (if any exist). The spoken & written descriptions are horrifying enough. (It is not for children!) I wish I could un-hear the plaintive cries of a mother orca after being separated from her child. That scene had to be in the film, but it is almost --it is-- too much. To call this film one-sided is like calling a film about the horrors of meth addiction, child abuse or the dangers of cigarette smoking biased. How could it be any other way? It is an absolutely unforgettable film. Update 2015: This film is even more powerful if you see it after you had read John Hargrove's book ""Beneath The Surface"" which explores the film's subject in greater detail. I can't think of a film + book that complement each other so perfectly except maybe ""Eight Men Out"" & ""Into The Wild"" (maybe Cheryl Strayed's ""Wild"" which I haven't read that was adapted into an excellent film).",10.0,jarthur0111,2013/10/27,21,18
14,Spider-Man 2,Fun action adventure,"Spider-Man 2 continues from where the first one ended. Peter (Tobey Maguire) is trying to divide his life between real life and his career as a Spider-Man, while Harry Osborn (James Franco) is franticly trying to find out who spider is, so he could wreak his vengeance upon him because of his father Norman, who was the Green Goblin. Meanwhile Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) is trying to figure out if Peter is worth the effort and if she should just go on with her own life. And then we have Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) who will turn into Doc Ock after a small mishap. In all Spider 2 is more complete and better rounded up movie than the first one was, because the main players are already introduced and this time they can grow better as characters. Only new character to be introduced really is Dock Ock, which is a part that Molina deliverers very nicely. The script holds together, the acting is good and direction very fitting to the story. Even though Spider-Man has never been my favourite comic hero, this movie does deliver good entertainment and I found it to be good presentation of the hero. It certainly is worth the watch.",8.0,tomimt,2007/10/23,6,5
15,Taxi Driver,"Martin Scorsese's Hypnotic, Paranoia Fueled Masterpiece","Taxi Driver is one of the most acclaimed movies ever made. The 1976 Martin Scorsese Masterpiece is as studied and reveled today as it ever was and for good reason. Taxi Driver is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen and the hypnotic story of a man losing his grip on sanity is truly one of the most captivating movies ever made. The movie itself is a study. It is obviously a ""character study"" but the film itself is a synopsis of the human psyche, rage, hypocrisy, melancholy, loneliness, obsession with violence, and its glorification in the media. This is all seen through the jaded lens of anti-hero Travis Bickle played in incredible fashion by Robert De Niro. De Niro's mesmerizing performance is truly one of the best ever put to screen. It is captivating in every sense of the word. He captures the essence of the character and makes Travis Bickle all the more enthralling, and for a film like this that is more than essential. This movie draws you in like no other. From Bernard Herman's score, to the mesmeric editing, to Scorsese's masterful direction, this movie forces you to relate to this deeply troubled character. The movie is so hypnotic that much of the film you want to look away, but to turn your head for a second would be near impossible. That's how much this movie's atmosphere takes you in, it is top notch in that. The movie showcases Travis' destructive attempt to escape his own isolation, social incapability, and to achieve self imposed vigilantism. The movie is a slow burning stick of dynamite, burning with flames paranoia and alienation until it explodes in one of the fieriest and explosive climax's in cinematic history. The movie isn't really about Travis' war on the inhumane pimps, it is about delusion, rage, social detachment, paranoia, obsession, violence, and how it can drive a man crazy. The resolution to this movie is also really fascinating. Its meaning has been the source for many discussions but the reason I love it so much is how it plays off the rest of the film. I quote no other than screenwriter of the movie Paul Schradar himself, ""I've always felt that the last frame can be spliced to the first frame and the movie started all over again."" Pure genius. This movie is really incredible and it just gets better each time you watch it. I truly recommend this film. The famous quote from the movie is ""You talkin' to me? Well I'm the only one here."" In Travis' case he couldn't be more right. ""I'm the only one here.""",10.0,johnterrell-67238,2020/06/29,5,4
16,Spider-Man 2,The Best Superhero Film Ever!,"Two years have passed for Peter Parker, established in his role as college student...and as a crime fighter. He can't keep up at school, pay his rent or make amends with his estranged best friend Harry, who wants Spider-Man dead. Mary Jane is more skeptical than ever of the man in her life. Peter's idol, a renowned scientist named Otto Octavius, resurfaces following a failed fusion experiment. Peter, at times noticing he's losing some of his powers, and is feeling the effects of the stress in his personal life, realizes he must decide between being who he once was or retaining his secret identity to stop ""Doc Ock"" and save New York City. From a disappointment from the first film of this series, I was quite relieved that this film is not only a lot better, it's the best superhero film ever made! There are much more love for the characters in here and the character development. There is also an emotional core throughout the entire film and it's not your regular superhero film. There's a lot of drama in this film, not only from Peter choosing a life to take, but he also has to beat the bad guy, and tries to tell Mary Jane that he loves her. I mean, it's not all about the action in here. The action sequences are much bigger and better in this film with nice CGI to top some of the most exhilarating action sequences. Tobey Maguire's acting is better, as well as Kirsten Dunst and Rosemary Harris. The villain, played by Alfred Molina, also does a very good job playing a creepy antagonist. There's one scene with him in it that was filled with tension, like a horror movie. Again, the score is also fantastic. This is the best superhero film ever made! It gives you the fantastic characters, great action sequences, it's emotional, suspenseful, and exhilarating as an entertaining film! This is THE MOVIE, if you're a comic book fan so see it, whether or not you're a fan of Spider-Man!",10.0,moviewizguy,2007/06/10,3,3
17,Horrible Bosses 2,Not bad,"Not the best movie of the year however it's not the worst. It's kind worth the time if you're looking for a light comedy for the weekend or wanna watch something light with your girlfriend. I enjoyed it as much as it deserve, nothing big but it will draw a smile on your face at sometime. Story line didn't have that much of an effort, but the overall movie serves it's goal as a light comedy for the night. Not so disappointing as you never expect much out of these movies but it's not better than the original though so it's not so bad over all. It is a slapstick comedy and contains enough funny scenes to achieve its purpose.",5.0,M_YCooL,2014/12/17,17,7
18,Crash,Wacky Comedy about La La Land,"And I mean to say it's about a fantasy world. I've never been to LA but I can't believe a major metropolis like the one in this movie exists in this universe or even in an evil parallel universe. The reason I describe it as a comedy is that it became that for me. Because very early in the film there are several moments that are so nonsensical that it kept taking me out of the movie. And once you begin to look at this movie sideways the whole thing becomes funny. The first instance that I'm speaking about involves Brendan Fraser's character. (By the way, there is no way I'm going to use the character names because you don't get to know them enough to ever remember them. At best this movie is a '100 most racially motivated moments' countdown). So Brendan is some kind of politician and he's speaking to his handlers about how to spin something that has happened to him. He makes a suggestion and within the same minute finds that it is a bad suggestion, and tells his underling to 'give himself a raise for that one' as if he wasn't the one who made the suggestion in the first place. No one does that. Bosses blame their workers for all kinds of mistakes that they make but not something that he just said within the same minute. I must have missed the next 3 lines of dialogue because I was thinking about how silly that was. Later there is a scene with Matt Dillon and Loretta Divine. I've seen bits and pieces of it on TV shows as a promotional clip. In context, it's awful. Matt is being very friendly with her as he's hoping to find a solution with her to his father's medical/insurance problems. And then he suddenly turns on a dime and starts spouting his issues with Affirmative Action. I'm not even sure if he took a breath. Nobody does that. Ever. Ludicrous and Larenz Tate. First off Larenz Tate is one of the better journeyman actors in this movie and the fact that he had to take a role where he basically plays sounding board meant solely to respond to Ludicrous, who up until now has been a rap artist, and to eventually be a bull's-eye, makes me sad. After being in the business for as long as he has he should have the Ludicrous role. But he didn't have the instant fanbase that Ludicrous has, I guess. So anyway, the ""China-man"" under the car. What was that? ""China-man"" sounds like a superhero who saves expensive dishware. That scene played as though it was meant to be comedic. Scary. It all ended for me with the scene involving Don Cheadle and William Fichtner. Fichtner begins and ends a conversation with Don Cheadle with the question ""--expletive-- black people, huh?"" Yes, that expletive. And from there on in, I couldn't stop laughing. No one talks like that. Ever. I don't know how he got it out. He knows he'd never say that to a black person. And he knows he's never met anyone who would do that. And between the bookend questions he used the word ""black"" about 89 times. Ridiculous. One day in the future Don Cheadle is going to sit down and watch this movie and see how racist it really is. Not that it's showing us racist people, that it is racist. So then wackiness ensues as Terrence Howard winds up in a car chase and does probably the stupidest thing any character in any movie has ever done, when he gets out of the car packing a gun and screaming insanities at a cop who is trying to stop him from getting shot. None of that makes any sense either but the moment when I fell out of my chair involves a Persian guy who hates buying doors and a little girl with a magic cloak. Remember in Pulp Fiction when God changed Coke to Pepsi? Well He's up to His Old Tricks again. Which I guess was an attempt to make the most predictable shooting in movie history unpredictable at the last minute. Awful. The piece de resistance. When that women started running into the hospital screaming ""Choi Jin Gui! Choi Jin Gui!"" I thought to myself ""oh please let 'China-man' be her husband, Larenz Tate being Don Cheadle's baby brother wasn't poetic enough"" Wouldn't you know it? The gods of cinema fulfilled my request. *tear* And the best part? Her name was Kim Lee. KIM LEE. Amazing. This movie was bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. I did my best to give it a fair shake, but it wouldn't let me. It was unrealistic, the dialogue was atrocious, and a lot of the acting was sub par. And the final scenes were blatantly mooning the makers of Magnolia. Saying ""Look, we made a really bad version of your movie and we're going to prove how unoriginal we are by doing our own sad version of the ""Wise Up"" scene but to play off that we're not, our actors won't sing. :P And the best part is we attached racism to it, so it'll get all kinds of praise it doesn't deserve."" As I said before at the very best it's a wacky comedy, at the very worst it's Best Picture as deemed by AMPAS. I don't know what they were thinking, if they were thinking. All I can do is laugh about the whole thing. But I do recommend that everyone see it, just to have their own opinion of it. I would never expect anyone to believe a review this one-sided, so please see it for yourself. But I promise you, these were my honest thoughts while watching this movie.",1.0,the_Poppuns,2006/03/22,108,62
19,Taxi Driver,One scene that has stuck with me for 44 yrs...,"Just a little side note, an observation from one scene that has stayed with me since I first saw this movie nearly 45 yrs ago. It's the middle of the movie when Travis is going thru his metamorphosis from simple-minded taxi driver to full on psychotic protector/vigilante; the iconic ""You talkin' to me?"" scene. He's in his drab apartment watching American Bandstand and as Jackson Browne's achingly beautiful song ""Late For The Sky"" plays, the AB dancers sway slowly to the beat, holding each other close...teenagers in love having a tender moment. Travis' face shows how desperately lonely he is; how he's probably never even danced with a girl in his life, much less had a normal relationship with one and how he needs to make a love connection with the Jodie Foster or Cybill Shepherd characters in a most sensational way. To me, a crystallizing scene that moves the story along to its' inevitable shocking end.",9.0,scorkery-762-655265,2020/08/08,7,6
20,Primal Fear,One of the most incredible movies I've ever seen.,"This movie blew me away. I haven't seen Edward Norton in many things but I am proud to say that he is now one of, if not, my favorite actors. The change in character that was viewed on camera was phenomenal and the subtleties of the first time that we see Roy was extraordinary. The fact that Aaron seemed to get very anxious and jumpy before Roy came to life are two main factors that helped the audience realize that Roy was about to be released. Norton portrayed that amazingly. If there are any comments that are made against this movie, you should disregard them. You have to see the movie for yourself to understand the real art of this film so I suggest you rent this movie immediately because I guarantee that your jaw will drop so low that it will be on the floor. This film never slows down and is so riveting that you should not ever take your eyes off of it. I didn't, and I am very glad of that. The movie is exciting from the minute it starts all the way to the very last second. See it for yourself. In my opinion, Norton should of won Best Supporting Actor in the Oscars given in '97 and whether you know it or not, after you see this movie, you will 100% agree with me.",,sportcoop,2002/12/07,2,2

Sure, good actors get to yell, and cry, and gnash their teeth, but their agents should really protect them from this kind of shrill, pedantic junk. Crash makes Magnolia look like a masterpiece.

Youngsters will like the characters, the older children will enjoy the jokes and plot, and the adults will likely enjoy the movie as well, being able to catch on to the more ""adult"" funny references and a story about a father-daughter relationship that can be appreciated. The movie is fairly fast paced, but most cartoons are, especially ones that are just 91 minutes long. If you're planning to take your 3 year old to appreciate the plot, connect with the characters, and understand the meaning of family and love... that's not happening... it is a children's movie but it's not Sesame Street. My husband and I took our 2 1/2 year old because it seemed like a cute movie to watch. It was. Our son sat through the entire movie and danced with the music, etc. We enjoyed it as well.

25,October Sky,"Superb film, based on real people and real events.","It was 1957 and Russia had just launched Sputnik. I was almost 12, and I remember my father pointing up into the October sky as we tried to catch a glimpse of the Earth's first artificial satellite orbiting overhead. Thus the title ""October Sky"". In West Virginia the son of a coal miner became intrigued with rockets and space travel and, in spite of his father's urgings that he accept his fate and become a coal miner too, eventually won the national science fair competition, and a college scholarship, ultimately became a key member of the space exploration team of NASA. A wonderful and inspiring story, and a superb film of that story. Everyone was good in the film, but Chris Cooper as the miner boss and stubborn father was far and away the best in ""October Sky."" Although ""rockets"" is the theme, the film is primarily of the struggle of children trying to break out of the cycle and become more than just another coal miner. As an epilog we learn that all four of the ""rocket boys"" went to college, the father died of mining-related disease, the teacher of Hodgkins disease, and the whole town and mining operation was sold and shut down in the next decade.",,TxMike,2002/08/14,69,56

I watched it and was amazed. I was speechless.The movie has so many twists! I was convinced that it was one of the best movies I had ever seen. Gere's performance is average. I say this because it seems that in many movies he plays the same cocky character. Linney's monologue in the courtroom is mesmerizing . It was just great. And Norton? Well this may be one of his best performances ever. The fact that this was made during the starting of his acting career was unbelievable.

27,Crash,Definitely a Lethal Crash,"Okay, lets all get a few things straight about this movie. This movie was good to people who usually watch *beep* obvious films that have absolutely no original arc to them. People would come out saying, ""Wow, I can't believe how much this film connected!"". Give me a break. If you want true art that's like this watch Magnolia. Here are my problems with Crash... 1. The character development was terrible. Yeah, bad things are happening to these characters, but did they do anything that should make me feel for them and be able to identify? No. I've got Matt Dillon the racist, Terrence Howard the director who speeds away from the police for no logical reason, Brandon Fraiser who is the most pussy whipped man on earth. Sandra Bullock who's a one note bitch the whole time. Where do I look to find sympathy for these people? I mean when Bullock hugs her maid at the end, who gives a *beep* She's in so much pain from falling down the stairs and has a realization. ""Oh no, I'm a bitch. Now let me embrace the first person who puts up with me...even though they work for my money..."". None of these people were believable either. Cheadle's mother would have NEVER asked for his little brother to come home in real life. Real life junkies don't give a *beep* about that stuff because they're too fried after all the drugs they've done. They don't have any real feelings left. And come on with the Iranian family. The father is an *beep* and I'm supposed to care that he thinks god came down and stopped his bullet from killing some little girl. It's a blank, it's not hard to figure out, especially since your daughter left the box in your store that says in huge letters BLANKS on it. *beep* morons. 2. The extreme push that everyone HAS TO BE racist against someone. Just take a concept and jam it down my throat why don't you? The first thing is about how Asians can't drive. Then there's the Osama comment in the gun store. Then the black car jacker who hates people who think black people jack cars. This whole thing is just showing how stereotypical you have to be to get people to notice you. 3. The characters time on screen were so short lived that I couldn't give a *beep* what happened to them. 4. The writing style was very contrived and not believable. *phone rings* *Cheadle picks it up* ""I can't talk now mom, I'm having sex with a Mexican."" *Cheadle hangs up*. Wow lets not try and stick a racial comment in there to cause a moment of interracial spat between lovers... 5. The direction was self-absorbed and didn't reach out to the audience. Haggis just wanted people to think he's a great director with his exploding cars and people barely escaping and showing their faces full of indifference after they were so hateful. It's RIDICULOUS. Whomever thinks this film is one of the best films they've ever seen needs to watch more than four movies. I would have to watch only Gigli, Waterworld, and How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days to call this the best film I'd ever seen. This film is for the large audience of people who don't know anything about film. People who think a film is good when the acting is okay across the board and the topic is racism and OH MY LORDDD things actually connect in the end! It's like Pulp Fiction and Magnolia...but with down syndrome! Matt Dillon and Terrernce Howard saved this film. They were both outstanding...as usual. Haggis should get on his knees and thank them for saving his career because without them he'd be stuck with movie called, ""The Acting is Terrible and Everything is a Stereotype."" Instead it's just, ""Everything is a stereotype."" I hope you think about this next time you watch the film instead of thinking about how cool and unconventional you are for liking a film that's not starring the usual suspects in the romantic comedy scene.",3.0,kaz1488,2005/11/25,26,17

30,Horrible Bosses 2,Maybe third time's the charm?,"Though I quite enjoyed their original outing, second time around for our woebegone heroes is a horrible dud. A better title would be ""Horrible Dudes, Too"", or better yet, ""Horrible Tools To..."". On the plus side,the camaraderie between the trio is intact; Aniston and Spacey do not disappoint in some deliciously villainous scenes; Foxx brings much needed braininess; and Pine and Waltz are both welcome additions (though the latter is criminally underutilized). Unfortunately, while there are some decent - or indecent! - gags along the way, this sequel is about as sophomoric as they come and shamefully lame given the calibre of the actors and the size of the film's budget. Beyond the clichés and weak story arc, much of the banter isn't that clever or funny. It's too bad that in their haste to strike while the market is hot, the producers and script doctors so compromised quality, settling for a connect-the-dot storyline that looks like it was developed by a bunch of fifth-graders. While good comedy can come from the most simple ideas and should be edgy, this movie frequently peddles the cheapest brand of chuckles by offensive stereotypes and degrading treatment of Latinos, Asians, and African-Americans. The gag reel at the end was the highlight of my film experience.",2.0,justapilgrim,2014/11/20,79,32
31,The Wailing,A film for those who like their horror films abstract,"'The Wailing' takes you by the hand and leads you deep into the woods. This is a South Korean horror film that doesn't actually reveal that it is a horror film until it is deep into the wilderness of its story. It melds folklore, cultural superstitions and religious mythology to explore themes of faith and fear, and how ultimate evil can be seen as something akin to a virus that infects and consumes, before moving onto the next host. This is a deeply fascinating mood piece that recalls the brooding atmosphere of Bong Joon-ho's 'Memories of Murder' and the enigmatic mysteries of Michael Haneke's 'Hidden', with spectacular scenery as the backdrop to some gruesome goings-on. What starts off like a pretty standard procedural investigative thriller goes through a remarkable metamorphosis across its (fairly lengthy) runtime. In a nutshell: A bumbling but endearing small town cop begins investigating a series of crimes that point to some kind of homicidal hysteria sweeping through his community, and all roads lead to a mysterious stranger who has taken up residence in the local woodlands. That's all you need to know going in and, to be honest, that's all you really know for sure coming out. The story winds its way through to some pretty unexpected and unsettling places, but spends its first half hour setting-up the foundations of an intriguing mystery while also being surprisingly funny, and it is this quirky humour that lulls the viewer into a false sense of security as a result. The comedy soon dies out and the disquiet sets in, plus the authentic performances from the cast keep it all grounded and lend the whole experience a reality, no matter how bizarre events get. There are answers in the film as to what is happening, why it is happening and who is orchestrating things and to what end, but the film has been intentionally designed to obfuscate any sense of certainty. Even when things are being explained, nothing is explained. Even when it feels like we are witnessing revelation, nothing is revealed. Writer/director Na Hong-jin wants us to work hard in order to drink from the well of deeper meaning. He is indeed exploring the notions of evil as a disease, superstition as a science, and faith as simple perception. In fact, he makes the supernatural somewhat prosaic, which calls into question how we are viewing events and how much of it is real, how much of it is magic, and how much is simply allegory and metaphor for the filmmaker's own spiritual discourse. Either way, whatever it all means, Na Hong-jin expertly unravels the tale at a methodical pace, like bait danging on a hook in the water until we bite and he reels us in with expert timing. But, much like a fish literally out of water, it's a bewildering and confounding experience at the end of the line. I am uncertain if the confusion is partly a symptom of the somewhat muddled plotting or if the ambiguity was perhaps an afterthought (the film apparently was in the editing room for a year and intentionally cut out some context), but it doesn't really matter all that much since the overall experience is so spellbinding. The closing moments, as with many scenes in the film, are both despairingly fatalistic and thought-provoking, and I guarantee almost anyone who watches it will jump on Google at their earliest convenience and type in: 'The Wailing explained'. You'll find theories, ideas, interviews and reviews on there, and gorging yourself on the thoughts of others might help edify your mind, but nothing will comfort your soul once you've looked into the eyes of the devil.",7.0,NormanCroucher,2017/10/09,14,6
32,Goodfellas,"Not a bad movie, but not that great either","Typical Scorsese effort: average crime movie script dressed up with great acting and pretentious, way overly stylish camera-work. I'm amazed this movie holds anyone's attention, let alone earns the ""best movie ever!"" praise you hear about this one. As I said, I didn't think it was bad, it was just wasn't that good. I had to force myself to keep watching, trying once again to see what other people see in Scorsese. I get the feeling all the praise and accolades heaped on him are just a big prank being played on me. At least the Godfather was an actual good movie, although certainly no masterpiece. A far, far better movie than this that came out around the same time would be Miller's Crossing. It's actually entertaining--you don't feel like killing yourself after watching it for just a few minutes, which is another thing about Scorsese I don't like. His slickness, bleak subject matter, unredeeming violence all combine to create an effect like a low-frequency earthquake hum or day-old shellfish--it's nauseating and depressing. I honestly spend the rest of the day depressed and joyless after watching a Scorsese film. You may say that's the power of the film maker, but I say that's simply the power of the subject matter. Manos: the Hands of Fate is pretty depressing for much the same reason. Art shouldn't always be uplifting (I love Bicycle Thief and the Year of Living Dangerously) but if it's going to put such misery on the screen then it should have a good reason for doing it and it should teach me something. A good example of how hollow the praise for Scorsese and his works rings is the famous Copacabana scene, a two or three minute steadicam shot following two characters from the outside of a nightclub as they wind through the kitchens and so forth and end up at their table. Scorsese's fans call this ""the best shot ever."" As I said, it's a long shot of a fellow getting a table. Kubrick did great tracking shots too, but the key to a great tracking shot, like any shot, is that it communicates something significant to us, puts us in the state of mind of the characters, etc. But this was just some people walking to their table. The difference is contextual and often subtle, but it's there.",4.0,KubricksRube,2007/02/27,143,64
33,Primal Fear,Edward Norton delivers the chills...(POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD),"PRIMAL FEAR is a good old-fashioned thriller with a modern twist. The plot concerns an altar boy accused of killing a clergyman who molested him and a sleazy lawyer who sees a chance to make tabloid news by taking the case. What he doesn't know is that his client can be just as cunning as he is. RICHARD GERE seemed to specialize in playing these kind of low-down heels (typecasting does have its perils), and LAURA LINNEY as the prosecuting lawyer has her hands full trying to play a game of one-upmanship against him during an intense courtroom trial. The story ends on a chilling note, thanks largely to the clever, intense and totally convincing performance ED NORTON gives in his film debut. As the guy who seems to have a devious split personality driving him to do bad things, he's the kind of actor who makes the audience sit up and take notice of his abrupt mood changes. It's no wonder he pulls the wool over so many eyes. Having said that, it's the climax of the film that is most stunning and brings the story to a totally unexpected conclusion. It's the kind of chilling twist that only the most clever scriptwriters can devise and make seem probable--but it succeeds here. Summing up: The kind of film you'll want to revisit once you know the whole score. Gere, Linney and Norton deserve high praise.",7.0,Doylenf,2006/09/12,81,75

If you are self programed to resist ""life-afirming"" stories, just stay away and leave the pleasure to the rest of us who still believe. And what makes the frosting on the cake truly delectable is that it is fact based on a real rags to riches story, no need to nit-pick what details were changed to make a compact story. Chris Cooper is one of the greatest living actors, and the complex, self-conflicted, bottom-line good at the core father he portrayed could only be pulled off successfully by someone with his skill and insight. The simple minded comments, refusing to accept a father who tries to lay down the law all the while sensing that he may possibly be off-track, expose the limitation of the commentator, not the writers or the acting.

35,Spider-Man 2,"It is not the typical sequel, it actually makes you forget that there was a part 1 of Spider-Man","Spider-Man 2 is the best movie this year so far. The last time I saw a movie this good was last year when I went to watch Finding Nemo. As a matter of fact, Spider-Man 2 beats ALL superhero movies of this decade and the 90s. To be more specific, the last time a superhero movie was done so well is the instant classic Batman, and SM2 even outperforms that movie at certain times. Spider-Man 2 improved on the original in every way possible, it took the formula that made the first one a hit and tweaked on it much more to create a masterpiece of writing, acting, and special effects. So much happens in this movie, there was never a dull moment, and most of the time, you will be at the edge of your seat. Derived from a clever and very strong plot, a whole lot happens in the movie. The plot includes the fact that Harry Osborn is still hunting after Spider-Man, and also investing money in one of Dr. Otto Octavius's experiments, who turns out to be the main villain in the movie. Meanwhile, Mary Jane is being a successful model and is also an actress that is getting angrier and angrier at the fact that she can barely see Peter Parker. Not only that, but Mary Jane is also planning on getting married to an astronaut. In the meantime, Peter Parker continues struggling mixing his day life with his two friends and his aunt, with his nightlife as Spider-Man. So much happens, you wonder how all this manages to fit into just 125 minutes. This plot is the reason why the movie stays fresh and exciting throughout the entire time. Spider-Man 2 has much more humor the 2nd time around, much more romance and tear-jerking moments, more action, and much more moments that would make you jump out of your seat. The funniest character in the movie is Peter Parker's boss, which is the bossy, mean, not-too-smart, manipulative and just plain awful J. Jonah Jameson. The standout funny scenes in the movie are any scene with Jameson and also a hysterical scene in an elevator involving Spider-Man and a stranger. Mary Jane and Harry, despite still being major roles in Peter Parker's life, are not around as much in the movie, but they are in many major scenes anyway. The acting was excellent; everyone did his or her part wonderfully. Tobey Maguire did a good job as the strong yet tired and vulnerable Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Kirsten Dunst played the beautiful Mary Jane with plenty of emotion and James Franco does the angry and unsure Henry Osborn. J.K. Simmons gives perhaps the best performance of the movie as J. Jonah Jameson. The main villain (Awesome performance by Alfred Molina), even though gets less screen time than The Green Goblin from the original Spider-Man, offers up a lot more scares and a couple of awesome fights against Spider-Man. The Green Goblin had 3 fights against Spider-Man, two minor, and one major. Dr. Otto has three fights against Spider-Man, 2 of them phenomenally awesome fights, and one smaller and shorter fight. One last note, I must applaud in Rosemary Harris's wonderful performance as Aunt May. The fight scenes were much, much, much, much better the second time around. The fights are not only longer, but have much more action, much more awe-inspiring little moments in the fight, and are in a much larger range. What I mean by the range is that the fight takes a lot more room, a lot more space. While the fights in the original Spider-Man are in a building or a burning apartment, the fights in the sequel take place at first in a bank and then goes up to a huge building, and then the best fight of all involves the top of a clock tower, and then heads on to a runaway train [Which is the best fight I have seen in years, I may add]. What separates this superhero movie from the other superhero movies is that it does an awesome job of mixing the romance, comedy, action, and jaw-dropping moments so that it appeals to every single person wanting to watch it. The ending reveals so much; I cannot really discuss much about it. In some parts it will shock you, in some parts it may disappoint, and last of all, it keeps you asking for more, hours after the movie is finished. It was fantastic, in my opinion, and it will appeal to a lot more people than the original. The sequel stays very close to its comic book roots and does an excellent job with the special effects. Bottom Line: Fantastic movie. Despite perhaps the ending at one point, which I should not reveal much of, this movie will not disappoint at all. It was truly worth all the hype, and is the most exciting, most rewarding, and funniest, and best movie of the year. It was more action packed than all action films out now, it is funnier than most comedies out this decade [cough*Shrek 2*cough], and because of the great close-ups and brilliant acting, I find this one of the more emotionally-moving films out there today. I was impressed, and I am waiting for part 3 already. The only thing that part 1 has the advantage of is perhaps the villain, I really did enjoy seeing the Green Goblin, but besides that, the original is nothing compared to this. Go see Spider-Man 2, now, it is a crime to not watch and experience this movie. Final Score: 9.5 /10 [A]",10.0,diac228,2004/06/30,3,3
36,Detachment,How do you rate a film like this?,"The most notable feature of this film is its flawed attempt to look at dealing with life by being aware of self. And it is flawed only because the self is flawed. The stylish art of director Tony Kaye is a simple but effective way to put into pictures what is a battle between a flawed but almost true to himself teacher Henry Barthes (Brody) and the contacts he must make each and every day all designed to test, challenge and dismantle his comfort zone. In one sense Barthes doesn't seek connection but he gets it just the same because every less flawed self is attracted by another more flawed self in the act of levelling. Barthes challenge is in the classroom, in an unlikely friendship with Erica (beautifully played by Sami Gayle), in a possible romance, in his father's hospital room, and in the edges around all of this. Because of the way the film is edited the feeling of chaos is sometimes very edgy, almost as if we have been watching out of sequence. But the result is amazingly satisfying as we go through the pain of almost every character as if it were our own pain. And if we take a moment to reflect it is our own pain. The sound track is understated and yet lingers. The cinematography is stylish throughout. The script is provocative and insightful and we are left with a feeling that no matter how permanent a situation may appear it is always temporary although there is always something that lingers. A film against which all others should be judged because it attempts to tell a truth.",10.0,perkypops,2013/03/17,8,5
37,Spider-Man 2,A Nearly Flawless Super-Hero Movie,"Despite #1 being a very good movie, 'Spider-Man 2' falls under the ""Surprisingly Better"" sequels. Now, that's not to say, #2 didn't have its problems. It did, including one lingering from #1 (pacing,) but overall, they moved forward with the series. And in high-speed. Already established web-slinger, do-gooder, Spider-Man continues his plight in saving kids and punishing criminals all the while getting beaten up (emotionally) as Peter Parker. In fact, they show more than enough of his beat-downs. We get it already – he's a nerd that everyone takes advantage of. At any rate, he's still pursuing both MJ (Dunst,) who's now engaged to a more ""stable"" astronaut and Dr. Otto Octavius all the while, he's avoiding best friend (of Pete)/mortal enemy (of Spidey) Harry (Franco.) To make matters worse, his mother's losing her home, Pete's losing his apartment, Doc Ock's becoming an eight-limbed crazed scientist and he's getting Spidey-blocked, or unable to use his powers as his mind's overloaded. There's actually a lot more, but that's for the viewer to see. Don't want to give away everything. Suffice to say, Pete's got a lot on his mind. Thankfully, they've up'd the villain-scale with Dr. Octopus played brilliantly by (unknown to me at the time) Alfred Molina. He ranks as one of the best on-screen villains of all time. His quiet tone, brilliant mind and attitude and mannerisms, especially being attached to 4 additional limbs, made him quite believable despite his appearance. Side Note: Doc Ock was always my favorite Spider-Man villain, and since they did a great job, this is my favorite Spider-Man movie, by a long shot. Hopefully most people picked up on the operation scene, when they tried to rid Dr. Octavius of his metal contraptions and how it was an absolute perfect homage to Raimi's previous work. That was so 'Evil Dead' that, though it was hard to watch, especially the nail scrape, I was so impressed that he came back to his roots vs. the main-stream 'Spider-Man' had become. If you don't believe me, split screen the chainsaw with 'Evil Dead 2' and 'Army of Darkness.' There are a lot of excellent action sequences, tension and fun to be had in 'Spider-Man 2.' (The train scene, itself, is worth admission.) Nevertheless, the movie should've been cut back some – pacing is such a problem for Raimi and enough already with on again/off again relationship with MJ & Parker. In addition, we get the multiple ""Should I be a 'superhero' or not"" long scenes. Superman did that, but only briefly in another superhero part 2: 'Superman II.' That's old and wears heavily. Thankfully, they move past it and you can enjoy the movie. Of course, if you can get past now multiple people knowing Spidey's true identity, that is. I cringe that the movie critic I respect the most (Roger Ebert,) called this the best superhero movie he's ever seen. I wouldn't go that far (I'll always be partial to 'Superman: The Movie.' Heck, a few years later 'The Dark Knight' blew this one away) but I would say it's absolutely recommended. Especially since we didn't have to wait too long to see Spider-Man swing, unlike part one.",9.0,thesar-2,2009/11/15,26,18
38,Intermission,Irish film-making at is best,"I'm quite surprised that this film hasn't got a higher rating. This really is a gem of movie. Well-written, well-acted, witty and brutally black dialog makes this a modern Irish classic. The acting is excellent. Colin Farrell is well cast as the stereotypical Dublin scumbag which he seems to have great fun portraying. Cillian Murphy is great as the lovelorn rogue John while David Wilmot steals the show from his more famous co-stars as unlucky in love Oscar. Kelly MacDonald, Shirley Henderson, Deirde O' Kane and Colm Meany add more weight to a highly talented cast. The film follows the lives of several different characters in contemporary Dublin and how their lives intersect. The violence and coarse language is matched by the tender and honest scenes. The fast pace of the movie holds the viewers attention fantastically well as we follow the lives of these highly likable characters(well maybe not Farrell but he is still compelling and hilarious to watch) while they search for love, happiness and the answers to life's complicated dilemmas. A true original. Even though its not much of an achievement, by far the best Irish movie ever made. Perfect stories. Perfect writing. Perfect characters. Perfect acting. Perfect film.",10.0,coffey-21,2008/04/26,12,11
39,Detachment,The most realistic movie I have seen about a teacher trying to help troubled students. Excellent and a must see. I say A+.,"""Some of us believe we can make a difference, then we wake up and realize we failed."" Henry Barthes (Brody) is a substitute teacher who is all but dead inside. His grandfather is in a nursing home and close to death. He has no other family and the only job he can get is substitute teaching. After taking a position at a severely under preforming school he does everything he can to make a difference. Finding a way to connect to the kids is not only what they need, but also a way for him to find out who he is. There have been a ton of movies about a teacher who comes in to try and ""fix"" the students. Even including the true stories ""Dangerous Minds"" and ""Lean On Me"" this is easily the most realistic portrayal of a teacher trying to help I have ever seen. Not wanting to give anything away it's not a movie where he comes in and starts to rap and all of a sudden everyone gets A's, nor is it him coming in and being a hard ass until everyone ""gets it"". This is what most teachers would try and do I think and I didn't think it was possible but this movie give me more respect for what they go through on a day to day basis, most of which is unnoticed or unappreciated. This is a movie that you just need to see, and every high school kid who thinks he is a ""thug"" needs to see and understand. As well as parents who seem to not care about their kids education. Another movie that deserves to be noticed and seen by a bigger audience then it will get. I highly recommend this movie. I give this an A+.",9.0,cosmo_tiger,2012/07/26,16,13
40,Crash,Lacks any sophistication,"What a disappointment. The story line is so simple - ""the good guys sometimes do bad things and the bad guys sometimes do good things"" - dressed up into a racial setting to make it seem clever, sophisticated and meaningful. It isn't. It lacks any subtlety. Everything that happens is telegraphed and then gone over again in case you missed the explanation. For a film like this to convince and move the audience it has to be represent the ambiguity of the characters and their motivation and actions; not simply present it as a series of 180 degree changes in each character's actions. Half way through I really wanted to waste no more time on it, but I thought I would stick with it in case it improved; big mistake I should have stopped then - it simply got worse.",1.0,dl100,2006/02/06,249,149
41,Taxi Driver,"Its awful, full of flaws to be called a masterpiece","Taxi Driver is a bad movie. U cant call it a masterpiece, It has too many flaws. Just because a movie keeps viewers guessing,it doesn't become a classic. I have listed a few points which everyone should consider after watching the movie and before calling it a classic. 1. The hero is shown as confused, psychic. But he acts perfectly alright while trying to woo his girl. He becomes confused, when the girl deserts him. So why is he confused, due to war or due to loss of lady love. 2. He is a poor man. Don't drive his own cab, but manages to buy a dozen firearms illegally and all of good make. 3. He roams freely with half a dozen loaded guns. Moreover, he doesn't sleep at all. He drives by night and by day he is on streets. He is having insomnia, all right, but a man does get tired for lack of sleep. Ask a doctor? 4. When his bid to kill the senator fails, he runs away. But is clearly marked. Security saw his face. Everyone know how he looks like. Yet he manages to roam freely on street, with all the weapons. 5. Next he decides to rescue a prostitute. Now, did the girl asked for it? No But our friendly neighborhood taxi driver, decides to do the job. 6. In the end he is killing all people. When he fires people get killed, but even after two fatal shots he is alive. This is not a supposed action flick, but a masterpiece. 7. The press hail him as a hero. But did anyone cared what was he doing there, with all those guns. Killing bad guys doesn't make him immune to law, but he goes free. I wish the people watch the movie with an open mind, not clouded by ratings and critics view. And review the points marked by me.",1.0,King-Rishab,2005/04/26,125,53

47,Detachment,When the cold connect with the cold,"Now here is a film I'm glad to see Adrien Brody in rather than the horribly tone-deaf and lackluster High School. To see Brody, an immensely talented man with an impeccably raw screen presence thanks to his pain-stricken facial expressions and ""common-man with baggage"" appearance, embody a role like he does in Tony Kaye's Detachment is nothing short of a sly miracle and a disappointing feat that it did not manage to drum up any attention or publicity upon its release. Brody plays Henry Barthes, a substitute teacher for a miserable, underfunded public school in New York City. The students are unambitious and compiled up mainly of delinquents, but were they nurtured in that direction or is it just nature and the fact that their roots sprouted in an underprivileged area? Mr. Barthes is hired to substitute for one month, teaching a high school English class. The experience begins on a sour note, with the students immediately holding a disdain for the man and being disruptive, cursing and harassing each other moments after meeting him. Not being taken seriously has to be one of the worst possible blows to a person regardless of any job title, but Mr. Barthes seems about as coldly unmoved by his students as they are to him. He doesn't throw them out of class, unless they bad-mouth each other, but just believes in remaining firm and asserting his position. After all, he can walk out after a month's work and never look back. His attitude is an efficient one, because he keeps many of his students in line. One wonders how the other unfortunate teachers in the building cope with their class. Mr. Barthes becomes increasingly acquainted with multiple females throughout his duties at this high school, one of the girls being an unfortunate, overweight soul named Meredith (Betty Kaye), the other a prostitute he meets one day on the bus named Erica (Sami Gayle). Throughout the film, we constantly see how detached from society Mr. Barthes is, and we question if it's inherent detachment of it he is trying to become attached but simply can't. Rather than providing answers to these problems, director Tony Kaye (of American History X fame) seems to be more intrigued in the way that these teachers cope with their impending personal lives and in their mentally destructive work lives. But one of Detachment's greatest success points, on me, personally, was the fact that it made me sympathize with teachers and give them a bit more credit than I usually do. The film showcases how the students they teach are clearly uninterested in their peers or their schoolwork in general, how persistent budget cuts from wealthy, ignorant politicians and their obsession with standardized test scores has lead them down a path of an almost incurable status, the fact that these teachers are almost as depressed and as hopeless as the students they teach, and their persistent self-esteem degradation by parents who feel they're not properly conducting their job. I should really climb out of my surburbia public school shell more often. Starring: Adrien Brody, Marcia Gay Harden, Christina Hendricks, William Petersen, Bryan Cranston, Tim Blake Nelson, Betty Kaye, Sami Gayle, Lucy Liu, Blythe Danner, and James Caan. Directed by: Tony Kaye.",9.0,StevePulaski,2012/10/12,4,3
48,The Green Mile,"a terrible would-be successor to ""The Shawshank Redemption""","I really wanted to like this film, I really tried to. But in the end I heavily regretted having seen it and personally I think of ""The Green Mile"" as the first appalling film of this year. This saddens me the more as the director of that film is Frank Darabont who brought us the wonderful ""Shawshank Redemption"". The parallels to his debut from 1994 are obvious: a prison story full of optimism(a friendship between the two main protagonists (one black, one white)) written by the same author (King) and again overlength (this time you've even got a running time of 3 hours+).I would argue that already the story itself is problematic in its conception: the characterisation is implausible. The prisoners (with the exception of one) are all portrayed as good natured men who obviously could do no harm to other people. It makes the fact that they've been sentenced to death for heinous crimes the more unlikely. For a grim and dark place like a prison the green mile is a unusual harmonistic place.This depiction of a prison and the characters is not just naive and almost laughable, it also reminded me of how more realistic and appropriate in such terms ""Shawshank Redemption"" was. People could say that the film generally is not very realistic since John Coffey has supernatural powers but I honestly think that capital punishment is a too serious subject to treat it as an element of a fairy tale. Moreover the film never questions the death penalty, the message rather seems to be that death row is a necessity. Again I was reminded of an another film, Tim Robbins' ""Dead Man Walking"", arguably one of the best and most important american films of the last decade(if you want to see an appropriate and artistic convincing account of the death row, then you're in for a treat).There's basically nothing to say against an optimistic approach when you're talking about such a sad, disturbing and important issue, but what made me really upset about ""The Green Mile"" is the unbearable extent of sentimentality and naivety in the film. Sure, ""Shawshank Redemption"" was emotional, too; but there it felt right, there Darabont managed to find the right tone - here it is just pure kitsch. When Coffey says towards the end something along the lines that people shouldn't treat each other badly and that he wants a peaceful world, I almost started to giggle. Moreover the contrast between the harmonistic, light- hearted scenes with the mouse and the execution scenes doesn't work at all, it destroys the film. Moreover these three scenes (particularly Percys revenge on Delacroix) are not just disgusting(and believe me, I can really bear a lot),they perfectly fit into this unpleasant mixture of feel good- mentality and pathos. There were good performances in the film (Doug Hutchinson, the ""Polaroid Man"" from Chris Carters ""Millennium"", Michael Duncan Clarke, who made the best out of his cliche role), but in the end I didn't care about the one or two good things I could say about this film. And Tom Hanks? Well, Hanks should really try something new-he's played the clean, good-natured guy so often, that it starts to get on my nerves and not just on mine.I just can't put into words, how much better, how superior ""Shawshank"" was than ""The Green Mile"". The difference is not just striking, it really hurts. When I was watching ""The Green Mile"" I heard people in the audience crying - I was tempted too, but not because I was moved, no, in my case it would have been out of sheer disgust. What a missed opportunity...",1.0,zza99tmk,2000/03/06,174,48
49,Taxi Driver,An Unforgettable Movie and Lead Character,"""Travis Bickle"" has to be one of the most fascinating characters ever put on film, and this has to still rank as one of the best post-film noir era ""noirs"" ever made. Yeah the story is a bit seedy but it's an incredibly interesting portrait of a mentaly unbalanced cab driver (Bickle, played by Robert De Niro) and his obsessions with ""cleaning up"" New York City. In addition to De Niro's stunning performance, we see a young and gorgeous Cybill Shepherd and a very, very young (12 years old) Jodie Foster. I've always wondered what kind of parents would allow their 12-year-old daughter to play a role like this, but that's another subject. Albert Brooks, Harvey Keitel (with shoulder-length hair!) and Peter Boyle all lend good supporting help. Bickle's transformation from a ""disturbed"" cabbie to a fully-deranged assassin is fantastic to watch, and includes one of the classic scenes in all film history: Bickle talking to the mirror and repeating the question, ""You talking' to me?"" That scene, and seeing De Niro in a Mohawk haircut later at a political rally are two scenes I'll never forget. The more times I've watched this, the more I appreciate the cinematography and the music in here. There are some wonderful night shots of the city's oil and rain-slicked streets. Also, Bernard Herrmann eerie soundtrack is an instrumental part of the success of this film and should never be neglected in discussing this film. Director Martin Scorcese has made a number of well-known (but not particularly box-office successful) films, and I still think this early effort of his was his best. He's never equaled it, although I think he and De Niro almost pulled it off five years later with another whacked-out character, ""Rupert Pupkin"" In ""The King Of Comedy."" In any case, there is no debate that Scorcese and De Niro are a great team and that Taxi Driver is one of the most memorable movies of the Seventies.",10.0,ccthemovieman-1,2006/04/03,77,51

He is a model for teachers. I mean he is warm-hearted, fatherly and full of passions,compared with the child-abused headmaster. He always has a way to get into children's hearts.He not only introduces singing to these ""impossible"" kids, but also inspires them for their rest life. Pierre Morhange is the best one.

Well,a simple depiction often needs genius and this movie proves it - there are thousands of people in this world who succeeded in achieving their dreams but there are few inspiring and ingenuous tales around - most of them surrounded by hoopla and glamor. The characters in the movie all make a mark,especially,Mr.John Hickam and Ms. Riley stand out (no offense to the hero Homer).I myself hail from a once-a-small-town and hence,could well appreciate the bonds that people share in small places. Some picks from the movie are quite appealing and touching : 1: Homer is lower down the mine elevator and watching the Sputnik in the sky again. 2: The boys running to stop the train they think coming on the track they dislodged. 3: Quentin asking Homer not to tell where he lives and Homer soothing him humorously. 4: Ms. Riley watching the final rocket from her hospital bed. The movie's background score,though not a masterpiece,suits well the fabric of the movie.

You will get tired of listening to duologue's about ""foot massage"", ""hamburgers"", ""Butch's fathers watch"" . etc, these things cover more than a half of the movies length without meaning anything to the movie. I was very disappointed when I saw this movie. This movie is way overrated and should be among ""IMBD 100 Bottom"".

What a shame for Travolta that this was his 'comeback' film. For me, the only watchable part of this film was the sequence featuring Bruce Willis. Even that, though...how Willis was convinced to be in this film is a mystery to me.

60,Spider-Man 2,One of the greats,"I always loved the first half of Spider-Man. I thought it was perfect. Right up there with Superman's origin in Donner's original. Tobey was perfect as Peter. Even Kirsten Dunst who is not one of my favorites radiated with a genuine girl next door quality. It had just the right sense of humor and it was wonderful to look at. Then the Green Goblin showed up. The movie nose dived pretty hard for me after that. It still had some good moments but it never stood as firm as it did in the first act. The sequel doesn't have that problem. This is a solid piece of work from start to glorious finish. This is not just a definitive Spider-Man movie. This is one of the best comic book films PERIOD. Maybe only second to the original Superman. It sure as hell beats all the Batman films (Bats is my fav and I can still admit that) and I think it's even better than X2. Everything works. Every character. Every action sequence. Every subplot. They packed so much into this that it's ready to burst at the seams. What other action films should pay attention to is what Sam Raimi has mastered with this series: it's character driven, not plot driven. Each major character has a strong and identifiable arc. John McLane is the same at the end of every Die Hard movie as he is at the beginning. Blade has had three movies and we don't anything more about him now than we did when the first one began. It's one of the first lessons of screen writing: create characters that the audience cares about and invests in. Because then when they're in those life or death situations it literally becomes an edge of your seat experience. For my money, there might not be a better scene in any superhero film than the train sequence in this one. It left me breathless. The biggest thing this has going for it is heart. Peter Parker has to be one of the most sympathetic heroes ever committed to film. You feel for this kid. You want him to get the girl. You want him to reconcile with his best friend. You feel his anguish when he has to admit to his role in his uncle's death. This is everything the first film got right with everything that didn't trimmed off. I cannot give any higher recommendation. I loved this movie.",9.0,headfulofghosts126,2006/06/07,9,7
61,Taxi Driver,Ladies and gentlemen: Mr. Robert De Niro!,"Taxi Driver, the classic that made Robert DeNiro Robert DeNiro. It's amazing to see how far this man has come in cinema, some of my friends ask me questions about films and advice, one of my friends had asked if they wanted to see where Bobby got the big notice I usually recommend Taxi Driver, granted he was in The Godfather Part 2 and was incredible, but Taxi Driver made him stand out as a strong lead actor. Taxi Driver is just all together a great film that is absolutely perfection. Martin Scorcesse who also was just really starting out made this movie that brought us back to the film noir genre. He made this great classic and I don't even think he realized how much it would stand against the test of time, to this day we still know this film and even if you don't know it, you know the infamous speech ""You talking' to me?"". This is a film about isolation, loneliness, and self destruction at it's worst. Travis Bickle who claims to be an honorably discharged Marine it is implied that he is a Vietnam veteran is a lonely and depressed young man of 26. He settles in Manhattan, where he becomes a night time taxi driver due to chronic insomnia. Bickle spends his restless days in seedy porn theaters and works 12 or 14 hour shifts during the evening and night time hours carrying passengers among all five boroughs of New York City. Bickle becomes interested in Betsy, a campaign volunteer for New York Senator Charles Palantine. She is initially intrigued by Bickle and agrees to a date with him after he flirts with her over coffee and sympathizes with her own apparent loneliness. On their date, however, Bickle is clueless about how to treat a woman and thinks it would be a good idea to take her to a sex film. Offended, she leaves him and takes a taxi home alone. The next day he tries to reconcile with Betsy, phoning her and sending her flowers, but all of his attempts are in vain. Rejected and depressed, Bickle's thoughts begin to turn violent. Disgusted by the petty street crime that he witnesses while driving through the city, he now finds a focus for his frustration and begins a program of intense physical training. He buys a number of pistols from an illegal dealer and practices a menacing speech in the mirror, while pulling out a pistol that he attached to a home-made sliding action holster on his right arm ""You talking' to me?"". Bickle is revolted by what he considers the moral decay around him. One night while on shift, Iris, a 12-year-old child prostitute, gets in his cab, attempting to escape her pimp. Shocked by the occurrence, Bickle fails to drive off and the pimp, Sport, reaches the cab. Later seeing Iris on the street he pays for her time, although he does not have sex with her and instead tries to convince her to leave this way of life behind. But after her rejection as well, Travis decides to take things into his own hands, ""Pow!"". This is one of the most memorable movies of all time and has really stood it's ground. It's personally one of my favorites and made me fall in love with Robert DeNiro all over again. The script to Taxi Driver is just so incredibly powerful and the performances were just perfect. Jodie Foster, this little girl at the time was such a presence on screen, she pulls in what was a very tricky performance and was hauntingly beautiful. Cybill Sheppard was also very beautiful and I was absolutely in love with her character and felt so bad for her. Everything about Taxi Driver is just great, I don't know how much I could go on about the love I have for this film. It's a film that you will never forget and trust me, if you haven't seen it, go out and rent it immediately, you won't regret it. It's bloody, it's twisted, it's crazy, but it's one of the best films of all time. 10/10",10.0,Smells_Like_Cheese,2003/11/20,164,140
62,Crash,"Do yourself a favor, rent the original by Cronenberg","Crash is overwrought, over-thought and over-baked. A great example of how to make a pompous and self-important film with a message. Haggis tries too hard to make his point and overreaches in just about every category of the film. It feels very much in love with its own sense of social relevance and has all the subtlety of a jackhammer to the skull. Sure, race relations affect everyone and there's a great deal of ambiguity to the issue, but the universe of 'Crash' operates to suggest that we are all victims to our own perceptions on race. It's a tiresome thread that repeats itself ad nauseum and wears out its welcome within the first 30 minutes. I found the outcomes of the characters unsurprising and forced and the film took forever to sputter out and die. The fact that this film is in the top 50 movies on IMDb is a testament to the public's willingness to get suckered by Hollywood malarkey. Indeed, if you want the real ""Crash,"" go check out the one by David Cronenberg: dark, twisted and original. This film plays as preachy, tiresome, and masochistic.",3.0,mglasson,2005/09/15,41,26

64,Horrible Bosses 2,"Rocky start, but full of big laughs","""Horrible Bosses 2"" starts off rocky, but in the end I laughed so hard and so often that it could easily see past that. The setup, like I said is pretty rough, but it leads into some good stuff, so bear with me. Between the first movie and this one, Nick (Jason Bateman), Kurt (Jason Sudeikis) and Dale (Charlie Day) have quit their jobs and started their own company. When a millionaire (Christoph Waltz) ends up putting them in a no-win situation, these three idiots get caught up in a kidnap and ransom scheme involving the man's son (Chris Pine). I can't reiterate enough how rough the beginning of this movie was. From the moment I saw the poster for this movie, I was wondering how they even set up a ""Horrible Bosses 2"". Weren't all of the issues from first movie totally resolved? How would these characters end up with bosses that were as bad, if not worse than the ones from the first film? That's why the weakest part of the movie is the beginning. They basically have to jump through these weird hoops to give us a new story. Once you get past that, and I certainly did, it is filled to the brim with laughs. There were not just one or two big laughs during this movie. I laughed consistently out loud because although I've come to kind of love the heroes in these movies, they are total idiots. That's what works with this movie. I'm sure there would be easier ways, if you applied real-world logic to this plot, for them to get out of the pickles they get themselves in. These guys are not bright enough to do this though. They think they learned their lessons from what happened in the first movie, and I suppose in a way they have. That doesn't mean they're any smarter though. This time around they have a slew of wholly new idiotic actions and decisions to make and they will do them over and over. That means you will get a joke, and it'll be funny and then out of the blue they will repeat that joke, right when you had forgotten about it and it becomes twice as funny. What I found surprising is that because the characters in this movie are so stupid, the plot becomes completely unpredictable. Oh you know that things are going to go wrong, but with these three, who knew what it was going to be? I think my favourite thing, above all is that this film is similar to the first one, but it isn't a rehash. It's just kind of inevitable at this point that these three idiots (and I really mean idiots; these guys couldn't willingly pull off a murder between the three of them in the first movie, and they barely got away with not getting all three of themselves killed) are going to get themselves in trouble. The trouble this time might have to deal with another horrible boss, but it's not the same exact situation where all three of them have to deal with a bad person and they decide to kill each other's bosses. This movie really is a sequel. It's the further adventures of Nick, Kurt and Dale. I was glad to be along for the ride. You can tell that everyone making this film was having a great time, and that it's infectious. The laughs come in quickly and consistently (and there are some outtakes during the credits to ensure you leave with a smile), there's great chemistry between all of the actors, the additions to this ""universe"" are a lot of fun, and they manage to make a sequel that will bring back some of the favourite elements from the first movie too. I didn't know what to expect out of ""Horrible Bosses 2"" and I really had a terrific time. I can't wait to watch the first movie again because knowing that these guys will have further adventures will probably make it even better. I'd be excited to watch it again because I was laughing so often that I know I missed out on a lot of the jokes.

65,Interstellar,"Absolutely brilliant, a masterpiece, one of the best films ever!","I went to watch this film, not knowing much about the background of the story or what it was exactly about. It started off well, although in my opinion it did drag on for a long period of time before they actually ended up in space. This does not effect the film though or my rating one bit, as it all worked out in the end and the build up was necessary! The special effects in this film are awesome, and are used in a way which I was literally at the edge of my seat, in shear anticipation, suspense and a slight sense of nervousness. Its very tense in many parts, and it certainly keeps you thinking. I don't know how people in the right state of mind can give this film a 1 star, or say 'disappointing', 'rubbish' 'stick to batman, Nolan'! These people don't know what they are talking about and are just trying to be picky and find a way to make the film look bad! Its a brilliant film, something suitable for all the family! Definitely a film for everyone, one of the BEST MOVIES EVER!",10.0,jacob199812-6-985282,2014/11/12,78,40
66,October Sky,A pleasant surprise,"I just accidentally stumbled over this film on TV one day. It was aired in the middle of the day on a channel not exactly famous for airing good movies. This one, however, was nothing less then good. October Sky tells the true story of Homer Hickam, a boy inspired by the Sputnick launch to become a rocket scientist. He and his friends begin to build rockets. His father is not to happy about his sons new found hobby and would rather see him become a coal-miner as himself or go to college on a football-scholarship like his brother. The story is well written. A bit too predictable maybe, but that's OK cause it doesn't focus too much on those parts of the story. It's important part, but where this is obvious the inner action, the action between the characters is focused on. The story is good. It has some clichés, but that's OK. It's based on actual event's so you kind of can't just drop out these clichés. The characters are really good. Where the story is on a downhill the characters are brought out and manage to keep the action and the quality of the movie high. You get to know these characters and you get sympathy for them. They are well written and believable. This is a good looking movie. The sets and the 50's style is thorough and the pictures are well composed and well lit. This all sets the mood of the film very good. The acting is really good. Jake Gyllenhaal delivers a great performance as Homer Hickam and Chris Cooper is good as John Hickam. As for the rest of the cast they are good too. All together this makes out a pretty strong cast. All in all I'm glad I caught this movie. It was first after seeing it I learned that it was based on actual events. If I had known that when seeing it, it would probably just be even more interesting. October Sky is a good and interesting movie. It's a movie I believe everyone can enjoy. It's kind of a feel-good movie. Not bad at all!",7.0,Stibbert,2005/12/29,8,7
67,The Wailing,"Good, but could've been great!","I enjoyed this. Especially the whole mystery aspect. I did hope it was going to be a lot scarier though. It's impossible to get even remotely frightened with so many silly and comical moments and there were times where I really wished it would just pick a genre and stick with it. This film does look incredible though and the acting kept me engaged throughout. While I didn't find it ""scary"" there are some genuinely creepy scenes and exciting moments. I was kept guessing until the very end. Respect for not resorting to jump scares. I do think this could've been so much better though. I guess the search for that trauma inducing petrifying nightmarish horror movie continues..",,Alba_Of_Smeg,2020/10/02,0,0
68,Horrible Bosses 2,About one or two good moments in an otherwise unnecessary sequel,"I enjoyed the first Horrible Bosses. While it had its flaws, and was a bit inconsistent with the bosses (the Kevin Spacey character getting the biggest storyline), it was nevertheless enjoyable. But this sequel has far, far fewer laughs, and just feels forced. These 3 guys that got their revenge last time don't seem so innocent anymore. They just come off as sketchy here. I give the filmmakers credit for trying something different here: making the 3 guys their own bosses. It is a sequel after all, right? But on the other hand, most sequels repeat the first movie's formula, which this movie does after a while, but not as funny as the first time around. Fortunately, there's one good moment: Dave, the boss from last time around. Kevin Spacey is the only one here that manages to give a decent performance. Too bad it's only a small part. Jennifer Aniston, on the other hand, seems to playing a different character (Did she quit being a dentist?). Chris Pine is the newest horrible boss, but his character just comes off as weird. Jamie Foxx also returns, and I still don't know why his character is really necessary. Do yourself a favor and rewatch the first movie instead. ** out of ****",,raisleygordon,2014/12/05,23,10

Broderick is perfect, but it is Jeffrey Jones who gives a searing comic potryal of Ed Rooney, a Mr. Weatherbee-like principal wanting to catch Ferris in only act of treachery; holding him back for one more year of high school. John Hughes is at his best here. The dialogue for this film has received such a following that it has even been printed on shirts and recited at parties by true fans of the film. I don't blame them.

70,Spider-Man 2,A damn near perfect summer blockbuster,"Two years on from defeating the Green Goblin, Peter Parker is having a harder time meeting the ongoing expectations of the public. On top of this the double life is taking its strain on his job, his personal life and his ability to even cast webs. Parker decides enough is enough and throws it all in  after all, he is only one man. Meanwhile, A brilliant scientist, Dr Octavius sees his life's work on a fusion reactor explode  killing his wife. Wife the protective device on his computerised arms broken, Dr Octavius loses his grip on sanity and starts to rebuild his reactor using money and materials from crime. With him seemingly intent on destruction, Parker must decide if the needs of others outweigh his own. With many blockbusters falling at the opening weekend this summer, the title of 'summer's best' was still up for grabs when I arrived at the cinema to watch Spiderman 2 (having only the week earlier given it the miss in favour of lighter fare). Two hours later I emerged having enjoyed one of the most entertaining popcorn films I'll probably see all year. The plot is more than able to fill the running time and, although the action scenes often have large gaps between them, there are no moments where I was bored  even if there are a few moments where the film slightly slows. The complexity of the hero is the main thing  he is an unwilling hero and the strain shows well on him. Even the potentially ponderous thread with Mary-Jane plays pretty well for the most part. The villain of the piece is similar to the Green Goblin of the first film in that he is a scientist driven to madness by 'voices' who we want to lose as well as feeling for  more tragic than evil. Where Dafoe was great as the Goblin, the silly costume hindered the actor, here Molina has no such obstacle and does very well  carrying off the 'voices' scene without it looking silly  it is only a shame that he has so little screen time as a person (he has little time anyway  but the vast majority of it is throwing cars around). With these complex people as the fronts it is any wonder that the script has no problem being surprisingly strong for a summer action movie. You could read meaning into most of it but it is hard to not see the New York people on the train carrying the prone body of Spiderman backwards as having a bigger significance  a surprisingly poignant movie after a big effects-driven scene. The script also throws in a real mix of emotions  perfect for a film that is more about being an exciting ride than a piece of art. Plenty of it is very funny, some of it is touching, some of it is about character and some of it, well, some of it is about cars being thrown through windows! And of course the latter is what we have come for. In terms of action, the several big action sequences are very enjoyable and put the skirmishes from the first movie very much in the shade. Part of this is down to the increased intensity of the fights due to the close combat nature of the character but it is hard not to be impressed by the impact of the vastly improved effects. In the first movie I struggled occasionally to get past the fact that some of it (not all but some) looked very much like an average playstation game. Here the effects are great; sure, you can still tell when a mid-shot of a character is real or CGI but they are much more convincing and they are used a lot better  making it easier to accept them as real for the purposes of the film. Of course what really makes the action sequences is Raimi's great direction. He is very able in the smaller moments but he is fantastic in the massive action scenes that he pulls together. At times his direction is very clever and my favourite 'reference' scene is also the one that surprised me that it was rated PG. In a very clear reference to Evil Dead, doctors are hammered by Dr Octopus' arms for the first time  dragged screaming (ED's trees) and tackling it with bone saws (Ash's chain saw). It was a very intense scene and, with it being in a PG, it acts as proof that the BBFC are not as strict as the moaners would have us believe. Working with this direction, the cast all do really well. Maguire takes the pratfalls, the moral questions, the romance and the action equally as well. He is very much the likable everyman that the film needs Spiderman to be and he is good throughout. Dunst has talked about her desire to do more than just this type of film and, from this, I can see why. Although she has some good scenes, generally she is sidelined and it is to her credit that she does as well as she does with comparatively little to work with. Molina is given too little time and lacks a really strong scene of emotion in the same way that Dafoe did in front of the mirror but he still does well. I didn't feel his pain as much as I really should have done but that was more down to his low screen time rather than his performance. Franco is good but a bit too one-dimensional; given that the third film will be very dependent on him I'm hoping he can step up to the plate more than he did here. Of the support cast, once again it is a wonderfully OTT Simmons who steals every scene he is in  he is so good that I never once saw him as his Oz character  an association I never thought he'd be able to break but he did  and he did it hilariously. Cameos from Campbell, Raimi and Dafoe are all enjoyable and add to their scenes. Overall this is not a perfect film and I am bemused by its appearance in the top 250 list here but it does basically everything it sets out to do and does it in a manner that puts this years' other blockbusters in the shade. The script is clever, interesting and involving; the characters are complex and pretty well drawn while the film delivers laughs as frequently as it does action. With improved effects and some very impressive action scenes this is definitely the movie to sue in a summer full of misses and average thrills.",,bob the moo,2004/08/23,148,91
71,October Sky,One of the Best,"Every ten years or so, a movie comes out that eclipses the thousands produced in the decade before it, and helps to define movie making at its best. I believe wholeheartedly that 'October Sky' is one of those movies. Like the best before it, 'Casablanca', 'The Third Man', 'Moonstruck', 'Amadeus', 'Almost Famous', this movie sits like a restful beacon of light in an otherwise bleak horizon of cinema. What well separates it from those that have gone before, is that 'October Sky' resides in the heart like postcards from your favorite aunt, or memories of Mom's apple pie or taking a trip back home. It stirs and then settles deep within and promises life anew and hope for the future. One can say that it is, after all, just a movie. But I believe that it is more than that. Its a movie that promises that when we reach beyond ourselves, and hope when hope fails, that our tomorrow beckons us with opens arms, and calls us warmly home. I gladly, unreservedly give 'October Sky' a 10 out of ten stars.",10.0,spencerthetracy,2002/11/18,1,1
72,Goodfellas,A great director at the peak of his talents,"It is hard to describe the brilliance that is Goodfellas. As good as Raging Bull and Taxi Driver are, I think Goodfellas is Martin Scorsese's best film and is a textbook example of a great director at the peak of his talents. The film crackles with raw energy and enthusiasm, the film is superbly directed and the final sequence is nothing short of stunning. The script is also excellent with memorable quotes, the story is never less than compelling and the pop and rock soundtrack is winning. The cinematography and detail is immaculate, and the ensemble cast is one of film's finest. Joe Pesci won an Oscar for his performance, and as good as he was, he is perfectly matched by Robert DeNiro and Ray Liotta. All in all, it is a brilliant film and an instant classic no matter what time, day, week or year. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,TheLittleSongbird,2011/01/09,15,9
73,Intermission,urban tale set in present day Dublin of the intermission between love lost and found,"This is a full blown nutty story of a group of characters in an area of Dublin over a few days in which their paths meet in unpredictable and funny ways and as the tagline puts it ""life happens"". There's a local small time criminal [Farrell], a supermarket shelf stacker [Cillian Murphy], his girlfriend, his mate, her sister and mother, a bank manager and his wife, a bus driver, a cop [Colum Meaney], a tv journalist, all their stories and the stories of the offbet characters they meet. Made on a low budget and starring many of the up and coming and the established Irish actors it is a kind of cross between a Robert Altman and a Farrelly brothers film. What with the number of characters and the quick pace of events it means that if you don't like one joke sure the next one is coming along and something is bound to amuse you. A film which doesn't really say anything about anything so it qualifies as art with a small 'A' but manages to sort of to capture something of the could happen in a plausible sort of way if the circumstances were right sort of way that movies like to make you think should happen, if you get my drift.

74,Goodfellas,One the greatest movies ever,"Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas is quintessentially one of the greatest movies ever. It is better than The Godfather in my opinion because of its real life approach to mob life. The film follows Henry Hill as he is brought into the mob life at a young age and how it brings him down at the end. The movie is just amazing to watch as it is like watching a documentary on the what is like to be in the mob. Adding to it are the amazing performances put forth by Ray Liotta as Henry,Robert De Niro as his friend Jimmy the Gent who is great in it and Lorraine Bracco who is very good as Henry's wife. But the performance worth mentioning is Joe Pesci's awesome performance as Tommy De Vito. His acting in it is one of the best performances I've ever seen. The film follows a time line from the 1950's to the 1980's and with it accompanies one of the greatest soundtracks ever put together. Scorcese has a knack for putting great soundtracks together and this is one of the greatest he's ever produced. Goodfellas is one of the greatest movies ever and one of Scorsese's all time best.",10.0,jintrieri,2008/01/19,14,9
75,Primal Fear,Quality Murder Mystery Thriller Based on William Diehl's Novel.,"Gregory Hoblit's 'Primal Fear' is a quality murder mystery thriller based on William Diehl's novel. Starring Richard Gere as 'Martin Vail', a lawyer who transforms from being a prosecutor at a major firm to an independent but successful defendant. A battle of moral consciousness. From a man searching for frenzied media attention to a man searching for the truth. Via his inner most thoughts being conveyed to a reporter throughout the movie, the audience, like a jury, try to make a judgment on his character. But the stand out performer was the rookie. Edward Norton. He delivered his character 'Aaron Stampler' with amazing credence. An incredible display of acting. And it had to be. This supporting character was really the cornerstone character of the movie. The supporting cast was great. Laura Linney, who played 'Janet Venable', Vail's love interest and opposing prosecutor, was also very good. Hoblit's direction was typically solid. Nothing too experimental. Just the basics. But he didn't let the story become too slow which is a major problem for any thriller. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good murder mystery thriller. Also anyone who wants to witness a potentially great actor (Edward Norton) perform for the first time.",9.0,keyser_soze4321,2002/08/02,6,5
76,Blackfish,Documertary,"People claim that Blackfish is a biased documentary, and whether it is or not, it still shows one thing: Killer whale captivity is cruel. The movie talk about how families are ripped apart, it talks about how emotionally damaged the whales become, and it talks about how the whales become physically damaged in captivity. Kasatka and Takara are just one example of an mother and daughter couple that became separated. They took Takara to another park because she was ""becoming too rowdy and interrupting the shows"" when really, there isn't any excuse in the world to justify separating a child from its parent. According to John Hargrove, ""then the company would make these decisions to strip calves away from their mothers"" (This Is). When they separated Takara from Kasatka, Kasatka went into depression. She stayed in the corner of the tank, hardly moving, and would chase the other whales off when they came near her. Kasatka would just sit in the corner, making noises that were later discovered to be her attempts at contacting Takara. When watching the movie, I heard the quote, ""all whales in captivity have a bad life. They're emotionally destroyed. They're all psychologically traumatized. So they're ticking time bombs"" (Blackfish). The first part of becoming captive is being taken from your family and being put into a small cage, a world so different from one that you were born in. As the movie says, ""can you imagine being in a small concrete enclosure for your life when you're used to swimming 100 miles a day?"" (Blackfish). Doing something that you've been doing since you've been born becomes a habit. You get used to it. And then with no preparation you're taken and put into a small box. It causes the whales to get aggressive. The movie states that there has never been an aggressive attack from a killer whale in the wild, where there are countless accounts of trainers being attacked by an Orca in an enclosed space. The movie tells us that killer whales are very socially sensitive animals, they are like people, they need to be with whales that they like, and if you put them with one that they don't get along with it causes problems. Tillikum, their main male whale, in an enclosure with two females that had attacked him and made him bleed. The whales can also get hurt during the shows with their trainers. John Hargrove said, ""I was the one treating sunburns because their skins were drying out because they were lying motionless on the surface of the water with no shade for hours, on and on"" (This Is). In the wild, the orcas can get away from the sun, and they can take care of themselves, but in captivity they have to rely on the trainers to help them and obviously they weren't doing a good job. As you can see, Orcas shouldn't be kept in captivity. They were born in the wild, and they deserve to be in the wild, they deserve to be free. Blackfish mentions all the reasons why orcas shouldn't be kept in captivity, not just for the sake of the animal but also for the sake of the trainers. It points out how dangerous it can be for both parties, premature deaths on both ends. ""'This Is Not Right': Former SeaWorld Trainer Recalls Killer Whale Treatment.""

And is the fact that he constantly makes us aware that we're watching a movie a sign of Scorsese's greatness? Even when it doesn't serve any real purpose??? I particularly dislike the ending - the lack of comment on the violence and the way Travis turns out to be a hero. Is this a critique of violence or a celebration of it? It is clearly not very hard to imagine someone inspired by Travis's resolution to ""clean up the streets"". Besides, I thought the film was pretty boring. Especially the second time I watched it.

79,Taxi Driver,Taxi Driver interprets Shakespeare,"THE SICILIAN CONNECTION Taxi Driver and The Winter's Tale What follows comes from work in progress on how Scorsese's movie may cast light on Shakespeare's play. At the end of Pasolini's film of dipus Rex the blind king walks out of his world into the streets of modern Bologna. If Leontes, King of the Sicilians,went missing, where would he reappear? The hero of Taxi Driver turns up in modern New York of 1976, as if out of nowhere, or maybe one of his own bad daydreams. He's looking for a job to suit an insomniac. Like the Great Gatsby, Travis Bickle seems to be be born of his vision of himself, and this casts doubt on the substance of both self and vision. He gets a job driving a yellow cab. Then he falls for Betsy, a girl with class Then he goes out of his way to foul up by taking her to a blue movie. There, his attention is soon distracted from the real woman at his side . Betsy checks out in disgust. Later he calls her on the phone, but you can't tell whether there's really anyone at the other end. So his thoughts turn to 'saving' Iris, a twelve-year-old hooker who has also come out of nowhere, into his cab. Taxi Driver is set firmly in the eponymous mean streets of an earlier Scorsese movie, and before that, of The Godfather, the daddy of them all. Travis now has to kill some bad people, one of them Iris= trick, a Mafioso. Travis has already killed her pimp Matthew, or Sport - almost twice. In the street outside the tenement where she trades he shoots Sport in the belly before going inside to continue his righteous massacre. The pimp reappears in the hallway, alive and armed, and has to be gunned down again, as if to get it right. But Iris is saved, Betsy forgives Travis now that he=s a hero, and Travis survives. Or does he? Do they? Does any of it happen at all? Can such questions be asked of a work of fiction? In Taxi Driver the narrative viewpoint seems clear. The film opens and closes on Travis' brooding eyes. Intermittently he gives a running commentary in voice-over, which turns out to be the journal he keeps. Sometimes the screen shows things that appear to happen independently, without his knowledge. So these events seem to be 'real'. But they decrease in credibility. Travis sits in his taxi outside a building inside which a tender scene takes place between Iris and her pimp. And now Sport says: Come to me, baby, and he puts a record on the phonograph. He tells her: I'd like every man in the world to know what it is to be loved by you. Inadvertent humour can't get much bleaker. But whose joke is this? Travis buys a suitcaseful of artillery. He practises quick draws in the mirror. Sometimes he packs two guns, but he (as distinct from his reflection) is right-handed. Especially with his star weapon, a forty four magnum. In due course he uses it to shoot off some of the fingers of Iris' 'timekeeper'. Strangely, this has earlier and out of his hearing been described as a typical Mob punishment. Then, in reverse shot, we see the gun in Travis' left hand. He goes on to finish killing the pimp, the mobster and the timekeeper. And then himself - a death he has clearly intended or expected - except that now he=s all out of bullets. So he pretends. He points a finger at his own temple. It lets fall a single drop of blood. He gives a death=s head grin. His thumb works an invisible hammer. Bang, I'm dead. Afterwards he gets police commendations, glowing press reports and grateful notes in what looks like his own handwriting. He loses the scar where a bullet creased him in the neck He grows back his hair, which he'd shaved to a Mohican crest. Finally exalted to a realm above human love and desire, Travis can patronise Betsy, who wistfully seeks him out, but can't get to him now. He's gone through the looking glass. Taxi Driver is perhaps the most chilling representation of psychic death ever to reach a universal audience. The question is: what sort of representation? In a Steinberg cartoon the subject, pencil in hand,is shown completing the picture which is himself. That picture is another of those 'impossible' objects which is possible because there it is. The work of art has become its own creator. It's been said that a work of art goes about the world independently of its author's power to intend about it. In Taxi Driver it's as if the film itself has decided to dispense with the conventional markers that distinguish between what's 'really' happening and what's inside the hero's mind. Such a work enacts the idea that all events, including events 'in the real world' are events in the consciousness; may only be events in the consciousness. We create the world, as they say, from moment to moment as we go along. If our dreams are allegories of the way we experience this world, then by extension our waking perception may be the same; except that it has to adjust itself - from moment to moment as we go along. The movie screen, arena of the 'dream factory', is the obvious place to see this happening. So is the theatre. Shakespeare's The Winter's Tale is like a still, a tableau which suddenly comes to life out of a sort of Arcadian trance as in the Book of Genesis; and as in Genesis, with the touch of the serpent's tooth. It shows a man in torment because he's recreated the world as the hell in his own mind. A hell which he has to exorcise in blood. To understand Shakespeare's great work you could do worse than read it through the eyes of Taxi Driver.",10.0,yurikon,2006/03/05,11,6
80,The Green Mile,Dedicate this review to Michael Clarke Duncan...,"First off, the reason I watched this movie is Michael Clarke Duncan. Almost an year back I read a post in IMDb saying ""The Green Mile actor Michael Clarke Duncan is dead at 54"". I wondered why IMDb mentioned a movie name at a person's death post. I don't know about this movie until his death. So I really wanted to watch this for him. It took almost an year for me to get this movie. As of movie, actually I lost myself in that movie for like 3 hours. I never knew how to characterize acting until watching this. I mean I didn't think I was watching a movie, actually I felt like it was so real. Tom Hanks played an exquisite role, I personally think if anyone wants to see what acting is, the search ends here. About Michael Clarke Duncan:- His role actually overshadowed everything in this movie. Who would have imagined a man with this physical structure would play a character like this..

83,Intermission,"Interesting,but...","If you loved ""Pulp Fiction"" and like hand held cameras you should love this film. I liked the quirky story (even though I feel that ""Pulp Fiction"" was the most over-rated movie since ""The English Patient"") and found the characters unrealistic but interesting. It's not ""On the Waterfront"" or ""Citizen Kane"" and is burdened by European pretentiousness. But the worst part by far is the hand held camera. It is so distracting and annoying I found myself waiting desperately for the movie to end. I don't know why new directors think this method of filming is so great. If you are prone to motion sickness, stay away, the hand held camera will have you nauseous in about 10 minutes.",4.0,kastellos,2004/08/17,10,6
84,Crash,Shockingly bad and formulaic,"A truly awful, moronic, super-PC, formulaic Spike-Lee-Robert-Altman wannabe. The other one-star writers have already summed it up well, bless their hearts for saving me from all the 10-star crazies on this one. I quote ""Sugarspheres"": ""It was indeed thought-provoking--all throughout the movie, I kept wondering how in the world can such a horribly pretentious, unrealistic movie get so many raves? One review, which I wholeheartedly agree with, comes from Peter Debruge of the Miami Herald. He writes 'Contrived, obvious and overstated, Crash is basically just one white man's righteous attempt to make other white people feel as if they've confronted the problem of racism head-on.' This was exactly how I felt while watching this movie. The characters were predictable one-trick ponies, the dialogue was preachy and unrealistic, the situations and coincidences were preposterous.""",1.0,larry-464,2006/01/15,37,23
85,Detachment,There's a reason why it wasn't released in theaters,"The movie does not achieve it's objective to show what a state of ""detachment"" is; how it comes about and how it is dealt with. The problem is both script and direction. It's scene after scene of tremendous conflict, a lot of which I would say is exaggerated. Every f-in character is conflicted. The movie tries to round out some humanistic side - but the main problem is that it pushes too far in every scene. Granted I'm all about reality and the gravity of the human condition and being real...but in trying to achieve that, this movie overshoots - big time. Reviews that give this movie high markings are from people who are impressed with the cast just for who they are (and they are great actors), and the desolation depicted. Rating on movie on it's ability to execute - the script and direction suck. Like I said, there's a reason the movie wasn't released in theaters...with such amazing cast - the movie must be pretty f-ed up not to make it to release and it is.",2.0,jnanasakti,2012/06/02,33,13
86,Intermission,Irish Perspective,"By way of response to so many bemused reviews, yes, Intermission wasn't specifically 'made for the American market', it is an Irish movie. Ha,its an Irish movie through and through. It is graphic, and hilarious. It is strikingly real at times, tongue in cheek at others. There are however universal stories being told throughout, things everyone understands, and the tone is unique. You can read the blurb to hear some of the storyline if you like so my job is to tell you that this is a very entertaining movie which adheres beautifully to the Irish sense of humour (spelled humour btw ha). Watch out for the young rebel in the red jacket, ten years old if he's a day, throwing rocks and causing scenes; therein lies the beauty of the humour and the tragedy of this film (thats film pronounced filim). Enjoy this movie people....!!",9.0,robbreslin,2011/08/31,1,1
87,Blackfish,The hoodwinked never lie.,"It took me several weeks to get up the courage to watch this. I had been in Sea World in the early 1980's and had seen the stupid morality involved in the use of innocent magnificent animals for money. Back then I didn't get it. I was there right after the first live birth in captivity was successful. Shamu or whatever it was. This is one of the most pure documentaries that I have ever seen. Plenty of clear evidence and the confessions of those who had been hoodwinked by the professional psychopaths. Once hoodwinked moral people just cannot lie. Using animals or children to make money is, well, prostitution. Pimps of whales. Watching the trainer's realization about what they had discovered once there and over the years and then just telling the absolute truth about their responsibility in the entire thing was amazing and human. The whale's slavery and then their compassionate mentoring while and after our abuse of them tells all. A perfect presentation and production. Beautiful.",10.0,taofpaul-883-826469,2013/12/29,8,6
88,Interstellar,A Love Story Against The Backdrop Of A Grand Interstellar Travel,"Love is the one thing that transcends time and space... New creation of Christopher Nolan's genius, whose name is now known to everyone. His films are waiting with a special look, because it offers something that every day, unfortunately, less and less can be found in the world of mass cinema - an interesting spectacle, filled with meaning, ideas and emotions. At this time, Christopher decided to send us not to the world of dreams, and even not on the dark streets of Gotham City. No, now he send us to the journey to, and perhaps beyond the boundaries of the possible and impossible, through the curvature of space and time, in other worlds. And you won't forget this trip, this can be assured. I was madly waiting for Interstellar's release. And then, finally, I was able to see this Beauty - at the premiere in my coutry on October, 29. It was incredibly exciting. It was a delight. It was unforgettable. It was gorgeous. Nolan once again amazes the viewer's imagination by his painting. Journey to the brink of infinity, the line where humanity has never set, acts as either the first-born purpose and a background of emotional history about the father and the daughter. A loving father who mankind need to help, but that he should leave his children, and a loving daughter who doesn't want to let her dad in the infinity darkness. Starting from the very first frame and ending with the closing credits, a new picture of Nolan will absorb you completely, forcing stare at the screen during the whole action, because it's all so exciting and interesting that escape becomes physically impossible. No, this three hours won't fly quickly for you. You'll feel every emotion, every event, every character. You will not look how the main characters travel through the universe, because the movie experience in this film is so excellent that you will be on board of ""Endurance"" starship and travel between the worlds with the main characters by yourself. The emotional core of this story is the relationship of Matthew McConaughey's character and his daughter - Mackenzie Foy' and Jessica Chastain' character. And the acting work of these three artists in ""Interstellar"" impress the most. McConaughey was acting really great, and this is one of the most emotional, if not the most emotional role of his life. All the drama and tragedy of the relationship of father and daughter in this film will not leave anyone indifferent. Anne Hathaway, Wes Bentley, Michael Caine, Casey Affleck, Ellen Burstyn and other actors also coped with their roles and presented the film's supporting characters very realistic. I would particularly like to note a small but important in this story role of Matt Damon, a character who has received quite memorable. If we talk about the characters, it should be noted also two robots that accompanied our heroes in this difficult journey. One of them adds a touch of humor in the film, which mitigates constantly depressing, dramatic, and sometimes really dark atmosphere. The script of the film is very well combined the history of space exploration and the relationship between Cooper and Murph. The story is complex and complicated, is based on real scientific theories by Kip Thorne, and indeed contains a reference to the ""Space Odyssey"" and other sci-fi pictures. This story about true love, about loyalty, forgiveness, fraud, hard decisions, and much more. And it is designed so that leaves a lot of room for the imagination of the viewer. It's also possible to notice some structure allusion to another Nolan's work - Inception. The story and visuals are combined just perfectly in Interstellar. Hans Zimmer's score, written by him on the basis of only one letter from Nolan, hold the key: ""Once we become parents, we can't help but look at ourselves through the eyes of our children"", deserves a special praise. On this basis, Hans managed to write just incredible soundtrack that perfectly harmonizes with the history and the visual side of the picture. And this work of the composer is really different from the previous ones. It is executed in a different style from another subject in its base. Very impressive work, which will be pleasantly listened again and separate from the film itself. Visual range of the picture is incredibly beautiful and circuses. The ""Endurance"" itself, new worlds, insanely beautiful and mysterious space, wormholes, black holes, and travel through them, folds of time and space are arranged so that is simply breathtaking. I would like to thank all those who contributed to the creation of a visual of this film. It must be seen. That mastery with which this is done, not just words. In the visual pattern also has some references to the Kubrick's ""Odyssey"", and they are pleasing to the eye. Many thanks to Christopher Nolan for having given us such an incredible movie, which once again proved to us that the cinema is Nolan's life. ""Interstellar"" is a film that wins the hearts of the audience not only with its sci-fi splendor, but also an emotional story that lies at its very heart. This film is not only about the discoveries, space exploration and the final frontier of mankind, but also about the relationship of father and daughter, who were in a difficult situation in life when one has to leave the other in the name of a goal that can not be underestimated. So, with what Nolan's genius unfolds before us this action is beyond praise. Combining the story, filled with not only real science fiction, but the true human values ​​and emotions, outstanding and very emotional performances, breathtaking visuals, epic and dramatic soundtrack, Christopher Nolan breathed the life into this film by his directing to create something truly masterpiece again.

89,Primal Fear,an excellent thriller,"A young stammerer man, ""Aaron"" (Edward Norton) is accused of murder. A lawyer, ""Marty Vail"" (Richard Gere) decides to defend him because he's completely convinced of the innocence of his client. He's not out of the woods... Yes, American film-makers are generally keen on filming trials but in this movie, the film-maker Gregory Hoblit succeeds in making the trial entrancing and fascinating and in increasing the spectator's curiosity. Besides, the sequences that take place in the court are the best ones of the movie. The movie also enjoys a good performance. To start, obviously with Richard Gere, very at ease in his role of lawyer, even if by moments, he's going over the top. But he isn't the main center of the movie. This place goes definitely to Edward Norton,, the discovery of the movie. For his very first role in the cinema, he showed talent and conviction. But ""Primal Fear"" is also a movie that gives back credibility to the thriller because Hoblit introduces here, all the usual ingredients: a murder is committed, a suspect presumed guilty, the apparition of revealing clues that make the story progress and of course, the inevitable trial. The set gives a suspense skilfully lead thanks to a rich and clever screenplay that leads the plot towards an amazing conclusion. At last, one of the last trends of these last few years is to surprise the spectator by introducing in the screenplay, an element that can challenge the whole movie. ""Primal Fear"" is a good example. Indeed, the end of the movie is absolutely unexpected... Perhaps, the only mistake that the scriptwriters made was to sketch a love affair between Gere and the public prosecutor. I think a situation like this one doesn't lend itself to a rather gloomy story. Nevertheless, this is an excellent thriller and one of the best movies made in 1996",,dbdumonteil,2003/05/18,6,5

Les Choristes has nearly everything: a fine builded up story, wonderful music and good actors. It's a small, sensitive and silent movie, not one of the big block-busters and that's what's good about it, because it gives the characters time to develop within the story. It brings the audience very close to the magic of music and the process of getting adult.

Instead, it gave what it said it wasn't, a fairy tale and a cheesy one at that. Once you get over the fact that they both have cancer, it really isn't a good movie. It seems like the fact that they are sick is the only thing carrying this movie. Some scenes were really unnecessary, rushed, drawn out and well...boring. As the movie went on, I couldn't take it anymore. So, as the lady was trying to help the girl up the ladder, I stopped it and returned it. There wasn't any love chemistry between the two main characters. It's more like they liked each other because of the fact that they are both dying. The chemistry is so forced that it couldn't fool a Disney princess. I love romance movies but this was a miss. I was expecting a heart melting story considering all of the hype over this movie.

It is supposed to be scary, but I did not know if they wanted this to be funny or something. I understand the title, most of the time there is people wailing in this movie, annoyingly loud, and this to have a scary effect. I can keep on going on how bad this movie is compared to the reviews you read here, but then I waste even more time on this garbage.

Football scholarships were the ticket out of the small coal towns. Homer knew there had to be another way; and when he saw the Soviet satellite Sputnik fly through an October sky...this dreamer's dreams exploded. Homer with the help of three of his friends would build and actually launch home-made rockets. Frequent misfires would land the young rocket builders into trouble; but many trials led to enough successes that the whole town of Coalwood, West Virginia found inspiration in a young man's dreams. A feel good movie that does your heart proud. The cast is rounded out by: Laura Dern, William Lee Scott, Chad Lindberg, Chris Owen and Natalie Canerday.

95,Hotel Transylvania,Unfortunately the director Genndy Tartakovsky decided to play it safe with a humdrum story that we've already seen before,"After the death of his wife, Dracula (voiced by Adam Sandler) creates a lavish hotel to protect his daughter Mavis (voiced by Selena Gomez) and other monsters from the pitchfork wielding humans and their hatred. Fast forward a century to Mavis's 118th birthday, a human by the name of Jonathan (voiced by Andy Samberg) stumbles upon the hotel. All hell breaks loose in Dracula's head as he tries to protect his hotel's image while being a protective control freak of a father. With a bucket full of monsters, the writers (Todd Durham, Dan Hageman & Kevin Hageman) could have gone horribly wrong or created a string of brilliance. Instead they wrapped the story around Dracula and his daughter while throwing in a string of cliché plots and a bit of a love story. The rest of the cast takes a backseat only stepping into the limelight for short funny moments that only peaks in the climax. Also, the whole monster-scared-of-humans concept was reminiscent of Monsters Inc. sans the cute factor. The animation is wonderfully detailed and well put together for each character. The film lacks sweeping jaw dropping scenic material since most of the film plays out inside the castle; Sony Pictures has clearly taken a huge stride in the right direction with their animation. The action was fast paced and entertaining while emotions never got overwhelming to spoil the fun. Screenplay by Peter Baynham and Robert Smigel didn't exceed expectations but was amusing enough to keep us in our seats. The kids in the theatre, on the other hand, were having a laughter riot. The background score was unremarkable while the songs were well placed apart from the one at the end, which was completely unnecessary. Adam Sandler as the voice for Dracula without his usual over the top antics was just right. Selena Gomez as *seen it before* Mavis didn't stand out while Andy Samberg as goofy Jonathan lacked variety but stilled managed to be funny. Kevin James as Frankenstein didn't have much to do and felt wasted. Steve Buscemi as stressed werewolf Wayne was brilliant as you've come to expect from him. David Spade as Invisible Man Griffin, Ceelo Green as mummy Murray, Jon Lovitz as Quasimodo, Luenell as Shrunken Heads and Fran Drescher as Eunice had their moments but they were few, and far between. A lot of talent there but not really utilised properly. With a house full of monsters, the potential to create magic was there. Unfortunately the director Genndy Tartakovsky decided to play it safe with a humdrum story that we've already seen before (Brave comes to mind). Irrespective of all that, this film targets kids and they were clearly enjoying it. With a long weekend ahead, Hotel Transylvania is the perfect film to satisfy the appetite of the little ones.

98,Interstellar,Massively overrated (or over-retarded),"I liked Inception a lot and was expecting something similar from Nolan brothers, but Interstellar turned out to be massively disappointing. It's too long, too boring, too sloppy and too hard to believe what all fuss is about. Earth is overpopulated and plants are dying from drought, dust is everywhere and starting to be a problem. This is all what we were told by a movie, everything that we should know (they think). So instead of trying to solve these problems by inventing new food forms, by ocean water demineralization or just soft decreasing of population to numbers Earth can sustain best minds came up with ingenious plan - go through suddenly discovered wormhole and see what happens. Instead of sending drones they sent bunch of people through to a no-return mission, three having reported of habitable planet each. It is when things started to become interesting. NASA picks up some random guy pilot (McConaughey) to lead mission to these three planets, all of them coincidentally in the same system, orbiting a black hole. COME ON, three planets orbiting a black hole? If you want to live here, you might be insane. However, in a retarded fashion he decides to leave his young daughter on dying earth to pursue his all-life-mission. Some more absurd plot decision happens when he then decide to land planet with such twisted space-time (because it is near blackhole, remember - we are watching movie pretending to make sense scientifically) that it has time accelerated 60000 times comparing to earth. Nothing very interesting happens next, three non-essential persons just die, Matt Damon being one of them by going nuts for absolutely no reason. In the end McConaughey diving into a black hole (finally making sense sequence) leaving only one woman in a mission (Hathaway) to land a planet she wanted first were her supposed lover landed previously. And while soundtrack plays loudly to draw attention from following absurd plot twist, main hero spends 60 years in another dimension translating quantum equations to his daughter on Earth which will solve all problems and allow six billions people to escape. By the way all these years everyone was just waiting, absolutely no one bothered to send more expeditions so busy they were all solving Einstein equations. Why so silly? With so many numerous big and small plot holes this can't be serious movie. Main hero acting like a retard (or actually he is), his daughter soon-big-girl solving biggest scientific problem in history, two absolutely useless crew members with funny robot as a company and a woman supposed to be main-hero's girlfriend, a lier as main scientist and a bunch of another useless people. Even CGI can not save the day. We were told that black hole CGI supposed to be most realistic than ever, but it was pictured in roughly 1.5 scenes at best. Soundtrack is fine, but it is played so loudly, in disharmony with deep space atmosphere and in some scenes being unnecessary as well. So what we have in the end? It just looked like they tried to make big, really BIG move about space travel and physic phenomenons, but somehow missed big picture and not really payed attention to the details, ignoring common sense which eventually led to a failure. Sadly, good opportunity to create such movie in the uncharted territory was wasted.",1.0,madint9000,2014/11/17,308,139
99,The Wailing,This will go down as ONE OF THE BEST HORROR FLICKS of all time,"I can't stop thinking about this movie and it's been 24 hours since I've seen it. I find myself replaying the movie in my head over and over. I find myself reflecting on the themes that it tries to bring to the surface. Easily, this goes down as one of the best horror movies I've watched. On the second thought, it's one of the best movies I had the pleasure of watching! It's smart, it's clever and it's beautiful! Words that you won't actually use to describe typical horror movies. What makes ""GOKSUNG"" transcend its genre is that it has so many layers but each one is as potent as the other. Like an onion, some audience will walk away only having seen the outer layer but would feel as satisfied as the next audience who was able to see through all its layers. I was taken aback when I read the message boards and reviews where critics and moviegoers weren't actually too sure if they understood the movie correctly. I've read reviews where they view the film as a social commentary between the divide between Japanese and Koreans, others view the film as a genuinely creepy horror movie, others view it from the tragedy that it is, others saw it as a spiritual exploration. And I was thoroughly surprised by this because I didn't see the ending as an abstract one. To me, it left very little to the interpretation. But to better understand this, I had to search through interviews of the director (Hong Jin Na) on what he wants the viewers to take away with them. It helped a lot how the film came to be. He started writing the script of the movie when a series of deaths started happening to his friends/family members. Though he didn't elaborate, he termed the deaths as ""unnatural"" which leaves me to think they were murdered. Grieved with the loss of his friends, he started asking ""why them?"". It brought him to a journey asking different religions to somehow demystify it. This movie was a result of that exploration. In some ways, the movie tries to answer that. Jong Goo, the ""hero"" of the movie, asked the same question several times but there's really no special reason behind it. The stranger did not choose them, it just so happened his daughter took the bait (now think back to the first frame of the movie where the stranger was seen fishing, putting a bait on the hook brilliant!) We often try to search for a deeper meaning into bad things that happens to us. To devout catholics, it's the guilt that it's punishment for sins we have committed. But in the end, we really don't have anyone but to blame but ourselves. It is within our will not to give in to the temptation/bait but sometimes we just do because we don't see through the events that will be set in motion. We often times act in haste thinking our actions doesn't have consequences. The movie forces us to evaluate who brings unspeakable tragedies into this world. Should we blame the devil for laying down the trap? Or should we blame ourselves for being too blind to see it? I think this point was the one that resonated with me: people in this day and age have become desensitized with evil that we rarely think that the devil is real in a physical sense. There's that unbelief in the supernatural that it has no place in our reality. Just like Jong Goo who had heard of (he charged it to village rumours) and seen the Devil (he thought he was a serial killer, nothing more) before but never really understood what he was up against. Several times, he was also given a warning to stay away from the tragic path he was walking into (through his dreams and the most blatant one, to wait for the third crow of the roosters) but alas, Jong Goo relied on what was logical in our reality. It's more logical and easier to believe that our nightmares can never happen in the real world. It's more logical to rush back home when your family is in danger. It's more logical to believe in a religious figure (priest/shaman) than a woman you suspect is a ghost. And that same unbelief is the very tool that the devil uses against us. ""The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist."" --- The Usual Suspects This movie is loaded with symbolisms, parallels and commentaries but never once did it hinder the narrative. It even enriched the movie, making three hours seem like two! The director's control over the whole movie is just masterful. To achieve a tonal balance between humour and horror is an achievement by itself but add to that, a movie that works on so many levels this movie is a master filmmaker who understands how to ""talk"" to his audience, what buttons to push to make them think and to make them feel. Hong Jin Na leaves the audience with this: Whatever ideas come to you while you watch the film, they're yours. I want this film to be your own. On the other hand, there is one thing I wish everyone who watches this film to feel, regardless of who they are: a condolence for those who disappeared after having fallen as victims of the world. And for those who are left behind, I sincerely wish this film gives you some time for condolences.",10.0,myc4971,2016/09/13,81,51

There are only a handful of films that have visually overwhelmed me and required a second go (or more). The first was 2001 A Space Odyssey. Star Wars Empire Strikes Back and Avatar come to mind for now. This was such a spectacle with a very complex script I'll admit I left the theater with a lot of questions. I knew it was a viscerally thrilling experience, I just couldn't fully explain the ending to my inquiring mind. I write this piece having seen this amazing film again four days later (No IMAX). OMG!

101,Interstellar,Nolan does an Armageddon,"SPOILER FREE BEGINS ********* I had a sneaking feeling that Christopher Nolan was a director who wasn't particularly good at staging emotional sequences, nor had a special skill in staging action sequences nor has consistency in his screen writing which may range from mediocre (The Dark Knight Rises and overall logical setup of the Batman series) or sublime (Memento, Inception). What always worked for Nolan was that his movies were always interesting and always intriguing and if the script was any good, he made classics. Interstellar represents a colossal failure of Nolan on every front imaginable. Let's start with the plot which is the most looked forward thing in his movies. The plot involving the World's end and the attempt to save it via Interstellar travel is so hokey that you may think you are watching a Michael Bay movie. If you could complain about ""Gravity""s leaps of logic, then you will realize there is absolutely no physical logic in this script. The story is a Galaxy sized plot hole. The sad part is that it isn't even original which you would come to expect from the Nolan Brothers. It's a bad mishmash of Gravity, Coherence, 2001 a Space Odyssey and Contact book ended by a cringe inducing emotional thread that it will compel you to flay your hands in the air over the inept acting, dialogues, staging, and poor editing, story and what not. If you were expecting an ""Inception"" than don't, Interstellar has the most contrived sci- fi plot in existence coupled with bad acting. It's Armageddon with a sense of higher purpose. At least I enjoyed Armageddon. SPOILER FREE ENDS ******** Now back to the plot points. Lets talk about the plot. The world is ending, and I could not fathom why, nor could Nolan show us the World in a broad sense apart from one single corn field farm in the middle of nowhere which conveniently houses an ultra secret project by NASA. If the world is ending, who will save it? Of course the ""Aliens"" or ""They"" (insert oooooooooooh). I thought the movie would involve humans discovering Interstellar travel.I never went into the movie thinking that a huge big ass Worm Hole was conveniently placed by 5- Dimensional unexplained aliens as a convenient plot device to jump into the whole space travel thingy. How hokey is that? And the hokum continues with supremely bad exposition ever committed on screen with fellow astronauts explaining how worm holes work (""Ah it's shaped like a sphere!) or how time dilation works in relativity theory. It seems like none of Johnathan or Christopher could truly grasp how these concepts should work in the context of the film and hence these appear as contrived elements in the service of producing cheap thrills (""oh we lost so many years""). And talking about cheap thrills, can anyone possibly out there condone how stupid the middle reveal was with our famous cameo from a famous actor? Okay let's talk about the ending. One can apparently fly into a black hole, make contact with 5-Dimensional entities who will present you a menu of quantum states of possibilities in order to save the world by how? How? By transmitting some mumbo-jumbo data via Morse Code through a ticking hand of a watch to a woman on the other side of the space time continuum so that she can umm fit it into the equation? or was it a constant? what is a 5 pager formula? How did it work? Hokey as hell. And the visuals? Oh the problem is since Gravity came out and took the crown of the best space visuals in the last 5 years, what could Instellar do? Well lets have some obviously fake looking CGI dust clouds. Have your space ship fly over a Windows wallpaper of Saturn. How was any of it ""Original""? Let's look at the planet. One has Water with a fake wall of waves, one has simply ice. That's it. Water and Ice. Where did you spend your money on Mr Nolan? Oh the Robots were hilarious but you would cringe in your seats thinking how a rectangular block of moving pillar was a good Robot Design and how the poor chap was managing to run on flat ground. And the acting? Cringeworthy Mumblecore. I don't think even the fanboys can save this one.",5.0,vikascoder,2014/11/07,282,127
102,October Sky,Takes One Back To A Childhood In The '50s,"This is a fine drama and a nice change of pace from today's more hectic and loud films. It is another solid based-on-a-true store, which still means much of it could be made up for dramatic purposes. Frankly, I don't know but I liked the story. The story is about a young man back in the Fifties who gets interested in rocketry and wants to enter that field instead of working in the coal mines as everyone else, including his father, does in this West Virginia town. The big problem is the conflict it causes between the boy and his father, which I think was overdone. I would like to have a little less tension between the two. The young man, still a boy, is played by Jake Gyllenhaal, one of his first staring assignments, I think. He's likable, as are his school buddies in here. It's nice to see nice kids in a modern-day film. The two other key actors in the movie are Chris Cooper (the dad) and Laura Dern (the kid's teacher who encourages him all the time.) The cinematography is decent the 1950s soundtrack is fun to hear. Once again: I wish there more of these kind of films made today.",8.0,ccthemovieman-1,2006/04/10,62,55
103,Spider-Man 2,Ten years later...,"This is absolutely fantastic. This isn't just a sequel that was just as good as the first, it whooped the first movie so hard and it set the bar extremely high for future superhero movies and movies in general to come. Toby Maguire, Alfred Molina, James Franco, Rosemary Harris and extras play their roles wonderfully. Kirsten Dunst not so much.The characters have matured and you'll care for these characters. The story is much deeper and the stakes are higher than they wee in the first film. 2 years after the first movie, Peter is suffering to balance his normal life and his crime fighting life. He's low on pay, he doesn't make time for Harry or Mary Jane, Peter is doing poorly in school, he doesn't want to feel this pain anymore. He meets Doc Ock, a scientist invested in his work, but when his experiment goes bad and kills his wife, he avenges her and swears to take down Spider-Man and all of New York by rebuilding his work, but bigger and stronger than ever. Now, Peter has to stand up and do what's right. The action in this movie is just perfect. Not too boring and not too intense. The CGI looks really amazing for 2004 and it hasn't aged yet. I love the fight on the clock tower and on top of the train. Although I did enjoy Danny Elfman's work in the first Spider-Man, he brings his A game to the sequel and it's fantastic. The music is calm, ambient, sad, and frantic when it appropriately needs to be. This is personally my favorite film score. It's just a shame that Elfman had an uncomfortable time composing for the movie. Quoting from the film critic Roger Ebert who didn't enjoy the first Sam Raimi Spider-Man that much, he said that Spider-Man 2 ""May be the best superhero movie I have ever seen."" If you have not seen Spider-Man 2, go and watch this. You are doing a massive disservice to yourself by missing out on a compelling story and spectacular fight sequences. 10 years later and I still love this movie so much. This is a special movie, one of my top 10 favorite movies ever. This will go down in the film history books.",10.0,Tyson14,2014/08/02,11,8
104,The Wailing,"Long, Melodramatic and Messy Ghost Story","In the small village Goksung in South Korea, police officer Jong-Goo (Do Won Kwak) investigates bizarre murders caused by a mysterious disease. His partner tells a gossip for him that a Japanese stranger (Jun Kunimura) that lives in a secluded house in the mountains would be an evil spirit responsible for the illness. Jong-Goo decides to visit the Japanese with his partner and a young priest that speaks Japanese. They find an altar with a goat head and pictures of the infected people that died on the walls. However they are attacked by the guard dog and they only can leave the place when the stranger arrives. Jong-Goo finds one shoe of his beloved daughter Hyo-jin (Hwan-hee Kim) in the house of the stranger and soon she becomes sick. His mother-in-law summons the shaman Il-gwang (Jung-min Hwang) to save her granddaughter while a mysterious woman tells Jong-Goo that the stranger is the responsible. Who might be the demon that is bringing sickness to Goksung? ""Goksung"" is South Korean horror movie with a long, melodramatic and messy ghost story. Despite the promising and original premise, the screenplay is confused and maybe the translation is not totally correct. Or maybe the situations make sense in accordance with the South Korean culture. The conclusion is confused and it seems that Goksung is under attack of demons that wins the battle. My vote is five.

105,Pulp Fiction,9 IMDb? Really?,"Sorry for the image, but if you take a bowl of crap, rearrange it, put some sugar and a little cherry on top, what to you get? ... a bowl of crap. This is the most overrated film of all time. I'm even feeling strange to call it a film. It has no story, no feelings, no plot, no music - just 4 different scenes of disgusting, violent, abusive, offending and racist content put together in a mixed sequence. How this crap scores a 9 on IMDb is beyond me. Sometimes when people see a 9 they automatically deceive themselves into believing this is a masterpiece and that maybe if they didn't like it, something is wrong with their opinion or taste. Nothing's wrong. It's a bad movie from beginning to end. The problem is that sometimes Hollywood movies are over-hyped for business reasons like what happened in Titanic and Avatar which by the way were ""OK"" movies but didn't deserve the huge credit they received. I gave this a 1 because Samuel L. Jackson was the only thing interesting in this disaster. I'm not going to tell those of you that haven't seen it not to, you have to go through the experience on your own and make your fare judgment.

Oscar worthy stuff. Also, considering it is a directorial debut, Duncan Jones (Think that's right) has done an absolutely tremendous job. The cinematography is second to none and the overall feel/atmosphere is the very gritty sort of space/spaceships we so loved to see back in the 80's in flicks such as Alien. This film doesn't lack anywhere except for perhaps the running time. I really would have enjoyed sitting there for a further 30 minutes or so. Heres hoping for a Directors Cut with extra footage! Well done Sam Rockwell and well done Duncan Jones! Bravo.",10.0,way2grimee,2009/08/03,27,16
108,Taxi Driver,Taxi Driver (1976)-A Film With A Fatally Flawed Storyline,"I watched Taxi Driver (1976) a couple of years ago & thought that it was a film with a fatally flawed storyline that didn't really deserve the big box office response & all the critical accolades it got. However, now that I've just viewed Taxi Driver a second time, I must report that I STILL feel that it's a film with a storyline SO flawed that there is JUST NO WAY that I can consider it much more than a mediocre film, at best. True enough, Taxi Driver is a film with some great qualities. The cinematography is exciting & innovative. The acting of the WHOLE cast is really superior. However, all the great qualities of this film are for nothing, as far as I'm concerned, because, at least for me, if a film has a story line that is fundamentally flawed, then that just makes the rest of the film pointless. True enough, there plenty of fine films out there with improbable characters &/or improbable storyline elements where through good acting, & good direction they were able to pull off at least a semi-plausible, or semi-believable film. However, there are fatal flaws in the storyline of Taxi Driver that no amount of good acting or good direction would ever be able to overcome. 1) That cabbie Travis would take beautiful, educated, impeccably dressed, upscale campaign executive Betsy to a hard core porn movie on their first date is just STUPID. Look, Travis spent time in the Marines & he has a reputation of being the only cabbie who will take fares even to the roughest parts of NYC without getting into trouble, so he has lots of life experience & lots of ""street smarts"". Moreover, his social boldness in walking in off the street to talk to upscale Betsy, & his smooth, seductive language when he is wooing her in the campaign office & then again in the coffee shop belies a level of social sophistication that is beyond the narrative of this film. So why is a guy like Travis, who apparently has so much ""on the ball"" STUPIDLY taking an educated, upscale gal like Betsy to a hard core porn movie on their first date? 2) That Travis begins to get deranged & delusional after Betsy blows him off, & that he buys a number of guns, & starts to systematically stalk candidate Palatine & then, after his assassination attempt fails that he goes to rescue adolescent prostitute Iris, killing several guys in the process is pure BS. Having a BA & a MA in Psychology, I can tell you that mental illness just doesn't work that way. If Travis spent such a long time plotting the assassination of Palatine, then no simple foiled assassination attempt would allow him to focus his obsessiveness elsewhere. In reality, a paranoid borderline psychotic like Travis would just regroup for another attempt to kill the object that he has been stalking for so long, not just ""turn on a dime"" & choose a new object to kill. 3) That Travis is a deranged guy who has been plotting the murder of a Presidential candidate for a long time, & then starts a caring, empathetic relationship with the kid prostitute Iris is just from outer space. A guy who is as twisted as Travis, who spends 24/7 obsessed with killing a prominent person just doesn't take a ""mental health vacation"" & goes to express concern to a teenage hooker & has a rational conversation with her. SORRY, but the severe mental illness that Travis was exhibiting after Betsy blew him off just can't be switched on & off that way. 4) That Travis is hailed in the newspapers as a ""hero"" after he murders 4 bad guys while ""rescuing"" Iris is just STUPID. a) Replete with his Mohawk haircut, & unconscious to boot when the cops arrived after the big shootout, Travis would've been pegged as a bad guy who was in a shootout with other bad guys, & as a lowly NYC cabbie Good Luck talking your way out that corner. b) Even if the cops & the DA did recognize that Travis was not a bad guy but a misguided vigilante ala Bernard Goetz, chances are good that he'd still end up in prison for murder because not even bona fide cops have the legal authority to have the type of self initiated, unprovoked shoot out with the bad guys that Travis had. 5) That elegant, beautiful, educated, upscale, uptown Betsy actually seeks out the lowly cabbie Travis & makes overtures to him at the end of the film is UNREAL enough in itself but that Travis blew her off & just drove away leaving her standing in the street is just FANTASTIC, UNBELIEVABLE, & the stuff of children's FAIRY TALES not of an adult feature film. For these reasons, & others, I must conclude that Taxi Driver is an otherwise OK film but with an ill conceived, bush league storyline that is not even worthy of a B-movie, much less international film awards. Obviously, writer Paul Schrader did no research on the complex personality that was the centerpiece of his screenplay.",2.0,JoeKulik,2015/05/21,104,58

110,October Sky,Believe in yourself and follow your dreams.,"In this true-life, inspirational movie, Homer Hickam is faced with many challenges and adversity, while trying to follow his heart and dreams. He became intrigued with space travel and rockets when Spunik crossed that October sky of the late 1950's, but no one in the coal mining town supported him. With his father's pleads to accept his future in the mining society, Homer does everything he can to follow his dream. He gets the help of his classmates, teacher, and other town members and goes on to win the national science fair competition and many scholarship offers, which eventually lead him to work at NASA. This movie should inspire all who watch to follow their dreams, even if it seems like the whole world is against you. It also shows that you can overcome any challenge life throws at you and to trust and believe in yourself. The cast in the movie, to me, were all pretty amazing. They portrayed their characters very well and they showed their emotions throughout the entire movie. The actors made it seem like you could feel their pain, excitement, disappointed, etc. when needed. Overall, this movie is truly an inspiration to all.",9.0,tpruitt4-1,2009/08/29,1,1
111,Interstellar,More plots holes than swiss cheese & a total waste of the 70mm film it was shot on.,"This has got to be the stupidest, most absurd, ridiculous movie I have ever seen in my life. There are so many ludicrous, illogical leaps in this movie that it would take days to mention them all, days. Nothing made sense from a logical standpoint in the entire film. Not one thing. Absolutely nothing in the script worked. Every aspect of it was so ludicrous that I was rolling my eyes, throwing up my hands or even laughing out loud throughout the whole thing. Masterpiece my ass.

112,Interstellar,Theory of everything,"How hard it is, probably, not to break under the exorbitant weight of threatening ambitions, especially when it comes to ""the most anticipated film of the year"" - that's how and in no other way did they call the last work of Christopher Nolan in a cinema environment. The benefits of this hysteria are few. Do not wait for ""everything, and immediately, and more"", because the blockbuster - the last word that comes to mind when trying to somehow characterize the ""Interstellar"", because the intellect here clearly outweighs even such a smart exterior design. As it went, it did not sound, but we have a truly multifaceted and complex film that can be adequately perceived in several different planes, and the maximum effect will be achieved only if you are able to look deeper. In the not too distant future, humanity is at a stage of regression: high technologies no longer worry us as much as the primary need for food. The farmer's profession becomes one of the most respected, and the craft is not easy, because for certain reasons nature is no longer our friend - one by one the whole vegetable crops are destroyed, refusing to yield crops. Against this background, the former pilot, and now the farmer Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) is invited to join an expedition designed to test potentially life-worthy planets in another Galaxy, the passage into which, in the form of a so-called ""wormhole"", was recently discovered in our Solar System . While the expedition is busy searching, Dr. Brand (Michael Caine) here on Earth will have to complete his research and development, as a result of which he plans to find an effective way to transport the world's population to a new home. But if suddenly he does not find it - on board the interstellar ship there is a sufficient stock of the terrestrial gene pool to start the population ""from scratch"" - this is not an iridescent version of the development of events called ""plan B"". As a form in his latest work, Nolan uses a so-so, relatively speaking, ""fantastic"" plot, in which, however, modern scientific research is much more than some fantasies of the creators. Without the second, however, it was not done either - but more on that later. At the same stage, it should be said that the script is really very tightly based on modern physics and currently existing theories, and uses a lot of scientific terms - so if you do not know, for example, what the ""event horizon"" is, and why the measure approaching the black hole, time slows down - it makes sense to prepare yourself a little before watching the movie, so you can understand what the heroes are talking about. For all this physics and mathematics, of course, there are real human fates, feelings and experiences. The film is still at the beginning, before the departure of Cooper devotes a long time demonstrating family interactions - but there, in the ""ordinary"" terrestrial environment, this looks quite ordinary. However, as the story develops, the emotions and factors that generate them gradually take on a completely different form - here Nolan already tangles this tangle consisting of imperfection of our psyche, instincts and feelings towards others much more densely. In the emotional aspect, the film turns out to be very strong - without any conventionality or falseness. It is here that one of the most memorable scenes that produces such an effect is due to the breadth of the talent of the magnificent McConaughey. After it there is no doubt that the viewer will stay with the hero until the end, at whatever cost. Nolan allegedly opposes the cold soulless cosmos to the warmth of real human feelings, emphasizing their significance. In this regard, I would like to note that the culmination and its justification will probably not be understood by all, since here the plot departs from the science trail, it goes, in the literal sense, to the unknown - without spoilers it is difficult to say more, therefore, I just recommend not to take this allusion literally, and focus on what it means. It is also important to read between the lines and see things in perspective - and then you can see where as more logic than it might seem at first glance. But there will also be an ambiguous finale, leaving behind mixed feelings, and infusing a new subtext to where it would seem that everything has already been laid out on the shelves. ""Interstellar"" amazes with its multitasking and coverage of the topics being raised. To some extent, this is also a minus, because the ideas embedded in the script, would be more than enough for three or four films. From this, it is not always perceived exactly, and at some moments even requires some effort and concentration when viewing. But in a decent way to accumulate so much food for thought in one movie, even three hours, by force of units. Not to mention how effective the picture works on the upper outer level, combining visual and sound images. Visually, the film is completely different from modern digital blockbusters: shot on a film and with real scenery, it generates an absolutely unique atmosphere. The same goes for the sound series - Zimmer clearly caught the mood: the sound is old-fashioned, unorganized and bright. This surprisingly deep, beautiful author's cinema is the long-awaited odyssey of Nolan, which remains in memory for a very, very long time.",9.0,BiiivAL,2018/06/04,149,79
113,The Green Mile,Well told story full of racism,"THE GREEN MILE-starts out with an older man, remembering the time he was much younger and working in 'the green mile', the prison cell block, prisoners were put in, before being electrocuted in the electric chair. The real story starts when a huge black man, John Coffey comes in, who much later in the film turns out to be able to heal people in a mysterious way. We also get acquainted with the other prisoners and wards. One of the wards is not as nice as the others, but a frustrated sadist. The story is well told with great eye for detail, also the actors, with Tom Hanks as main character are giving excellent performances. The film loses (great part) of its' credibility when John Coffey starts working his miracles. It is not very clear why we need to see not one, not two, but THREE electrocutions(of which one goes wrong and never seems to end). But what is mainly disturbing about this film is not so much its' length or the unnecessary flashback (why not start right away with the story?), but the portrayal of its charachters. The film seems to be trying to tell us, that we should be nice to all, no matter what or who, not be racist, but it does it in a very stereotypical and disturbing way, and thus sending the opposite message. As Hall already once argued, a representation of, for example violence, is not violence, but a message about violence. The huge, muscled black guy, is really a softy who is hardly able to pronounce grammarly correct sentences. It is very surprising nobody protested against this terrible stereotype, which I supposed has been overcome and belonged to the past, where blacks were thought simple and stupid. The nice wards are all good christians (after all, we are in the south of America), and therefor it is impossible that someone who is able to perform miracles has done any harm. And indeed this 'angel' turns out to be innocent. Yep, the Good and the Bad are not to be mixed up, ignoring roughly the enormous grey area in between. Surprising then that it is OK to treat the nasty ward, Percy, in a very cruel manner. OK, he is a very bad guy, but weren't we supposed to be nice to all? * 1/2 out of five",4.0,ladwash,2000/05/29,10,5

After you realize the whole film is nothing but a parade of clichés, you may decide to walk out because nothing original is going to happen. Or stay and try to figure out which of the leads would be dying first. Acting is terrible and the fault is obviously in the stars: Gus character and Dad are not able to act, they only pause for the cameras. It gets annoying sometimes, and you start thinking after 15 minutes into the film, would this guy ever be able to keep his lips closed for once please. And he does not! Film is so boring and this is nothing, it has more than one ending. So, when you have the feeling that it's coming to an end... this is wishful thinking. You are far from that happy moment. There is still too many ridiculous cliché moments to watch which are aimed to make viewers cry. Do yourself a favor, do not watch it!

115,Horrible Bosses 2,Probably not as helpful as the original HORRIBLE BOSSES . . .,". . . in providing tips on how to fulfill the American Dream of many if not most U.S. 99 per centers: how to off your supervisor, and get away with it (hopefully with some sort of a profit). Since this is the underlying premise of the entire HORRIBLE BOSSES series, it is somewhat disappointing that the filmmakers seem to have lost sight of the donut by dwelling upon the hole with just the first sequel in their franchise. When you call your series HORRIBLE BOSSES, people don't want to plunk down their limited multiplex dollars to see the abused employees turning into abusing bosses themselves! That would be like remaking ANIMAL FARM, and who wants to see THAT (even if it's FREE!). However, the original film's hapless trio spends half their time doing their best to become ""horrible bosses,"" with the remainder of this flick taken up by an Un-funny crime caper that just goes on and on, in a somewhat pointless fashion. In the unlikely event that there's a HORRIBLE BOSSES 3, let's hope that the leading characters get back to being the good guys with whom most everyone can sympathize.",7.0,pixrox1,2014/12/04,14,7
116,The Chorus,Pleasure to the heart,"Like Sound of Music and other several films that conquer the audiences' affection by depicting a music teacher transforming their naughty anti-social students into compassionate and happy ones, the Chorus uses spectacular techniques to convey the grandeur hidden in education. Clement Matthieu is indeed the paragon of all teachers, the audience will inevitably fall in love with him as the movie proceeds. As an epitome of all extraordinary reformers, he gradually nurture his students' souls instead of directly contradicting Mr. Haxon for his cruel and senseless abuse. He is the main reason I stared at my broken computer screen with sore sockets and dizzy head for 96 minutes. The film flows with a beautiful spontaneity and pleasant harmony, from the daunting prison gate and a morose little boy staring out of it, to the cruel action-reaction principle, to the terrifying noise and bloody jokes made by the students, the movie successfully created a challenge that make the audience gasp in awe. Then comes the idea of a chorus bringing order to the class and quenching the everlasting riots, with involuting development of Pépinot, Morhange, Mondain and Le Querrec. The highlight came when Mondain was arrested for stealing, Madame Morhange declared her marriage to an engineer, the duchess's condescending appreciation of the chorus, and the fire accident that induced the heated quarrel with headmaster Haxon. The director meticulously places events of similar tension together to pull the audience deeper into the swamp of entangled interactions between the characters. Unlike those cheap commercial films, the Chorus squeezes our attention tighter and tighter in its grip until the moment the screen blackens out. I signed with satisfaction and refreshment of my soul, and I'm sure I'm not the only one. Can't comment on this film without mentioning the music. The director was formally a musician, background music and sound of the choir here is angelic, bleaching my senses with a transcendent pureness and comfort. The film wouldn't be so perfect if the audience aren't paralyzed by the heavenly music. The fluent camera angles and sincerity emitted from dialogues are perfect instrument of this huge symphony. The Chorus definitely deserves being stored in your watch list, and review whenever you feel rejected or exhausted or need of a loving mentor.",9.0,zhongzl-kelley2014,2015/11/07,0,0

Its funny and not just simply stupid as most of the teen movies today are. All the characters in this movie are likable and full of humour and wisdom. The story is quite simple as the title suggests. Ferris Bueller{played exceptionally well by Matthew Broderick}, a character no one would hate is an expert at fooling his parents, everybody likes him, and nobody can avoid his favour. He has a beautiful girlfriend, Sloane {Mia Sara}, and a very paranoid, yet lovable best friend, Cameron {Alan Ruck}. One of the things to notice is that the movie is completely original. Sure the stuff that Ferris pulls off aren't exactly doable but this movie serves as a guidebook for fun. What a sad coincidence that I saw this movie for the first time yesterday and the great John Hughes {director of this and some other nice movies} died the same day...RIP John.

120,Horrible Bosses 2,Not worth the price of admission.,"Just about every movie I've seen lately is not worth it. In fact, I feel like a dummy for even going to the movies lately. Maybe my taste is changing, but this movie was just boring. I, like most of the folks I've seen leaving a review, enjoyed the first ""Horrible Bosses,"" immensely and found it to be one of the better comedies in recent memory. I went into #2 knowing it wouldn't have the same comic surprise or wow factor, but I wasn't expecting it to be so boring. I'll be quick about my reasons why this movie sucks. Christoph Waltz' role is wasted. All he does is say, ""Oh, I am going to buy your company."" Oh and then he gets shot to death. One of the best actors in the film is probably the least used in the movie. Surprising because he could have been a really maniacal ""boss."" The brand of humor is not that funny. This movie tries to employ gags and sex humor as opposed to the last film which used more situational humor. Ex. ""Which Brady would you f**k?"" ""Oh, I'd have to marry Peter, kill Bobby, and f**k Greg."" Okay, so now we are resorting to pedophilia for laughs? Just dumb. The story is incredibly unbelievable. Really, it is. The first movie was a stretch, but at least it was semi-plausible. Jamie Fox's role as Mufugga Jones is just filler, no substance. The big joke about him being bad about negotiating is just an eye roller. He was not even 1/10 as funny as he was in the first movie. The only time I really laughed is the shower scene in the beginning of the movie. That part is genuinely funny, but the rest of the movie is a bore fest. This movie had an all-star cast and could have gone in any other direction, but it chose the ""kidnaping"" direction. Laaaaaaaaaaame. This is a rent-only or download only movie. Seriously, don't spend $10 on it. PS Another wasted role is Jonathan Banks aka Mike from Breaking Bad.",5.0,jackbanister16,2014/12/12,17,8
121,Primal Fear,Edward Norton.....Excellent!!!,"I have seen this movie quite a few times and even though I know how it is going to end, I am still amazed at the acting of Edward Norton. This was the first Edward Norton movie I had ever seen and even though ""Fight Club"" did not impress me I have yet to be disappointed by any of his performances. Richard Gere was great, as usual but I think he was well overshadowed by Norton.",,lessard25,2002/08/06,2,2
122,Interstellar,Makes three hours feel like a lifetime - awful,"OK, I'll keep this brief, but I'll also nail my credentials to the mast first. I know science, cosmology, sci-fi and film-making pretty well. I have, in the past taught film studies at degree level, and worked on the production of more than one major Hollywood sci-fi film. I read Stephen Baxter and I like space stuff a lot. More than a lot. And why am I telling you this? Because I should have loved ""Interstellar"", but I didn't for one simple reason: It is a truly dreadful piece of film-making. I won't even bother with dissecting the ""science"" in the film, because that isn't really the issue (it is wrong on pretty much every level). I'm not even going to bother complaining about the absurd audio balance in the sound mix. And I'll ignore the sub-standard special effects - because FX don't a great movie make. The issues I have with Interstellar are essentially these: The film is an arse-numbing three hours long, and feels far longer. The pace is stunningly poorly judged - the first hour in particular could have been cut to ten minutes and far more would have been gained than lost. The characters are paper-thin, and I didn't care about any of them. The plot is entirely derivative (mostly of the vastly superior ""Contact""). The special effects aren't special at all and the editing (or lack of) is so self-indulgent it is a text book example of a director so enamoured with his project that he loses objectivity. The result is a plodding, flabby, and desperately dull movie devoid of any real excitement or emotional impact. I won't go on, but special mention must be made of the planets - Paddling World and Coldworld. You see virtually nothing of either, and so utterly uninteresting are they that what should have been a moment of genuine cinematic wonderment was squandered with a bit of poor CGI painfully inferior to ""A Perfect Storm"" and a location less dramatic than your own back garden. I've probably not been a brief as I intended, but as I write this I feel the disappointment and actual anger I felt on leaving the cinema bubbling to the surface again. It was a total let-down and a waste of more than three hours of my life. The gushing reviews on here are ridiculous and absurd, and I am forced to conclude that reviewers either watched a different film to me, or saw something so brilliant it completely passed me by. I am fairly confident I didn't doze off, although I desperately wanted to. So in conclusion, ""Contact"" did all of this far, far better, fifteen years ago. In Contact the characters are human, believable, beautifully realised and you care what happens to them. The relationship between Father and Daughter is deeply moving and inspiring. But then the plot is far more sophisticated anyway, dealing with the social tensions and impact of the discovery of extra-terrestrial life, the science is accurate and entirely plausible (it was written by Carl Sagan after all), the movie is genuinely thrilling and full of spectacle, and it has something very profound to say. Contact is everything Interstellar is not, and it has a considerably shorter running time. Contact brought tears to my eyes, Interstellar bored me to tears.",2.0,BlokeWithABrainUK,2014/11/21,1275,569
123,Detachment,your typical annoying art film,"first let me set the record straight, my favorite director is Ingmar Bergman and no I don't like the avengers, so I got nothing against art films in general, but this is way too much. The thing that annoys me most about this film is how nobody took the effort to build these characters at all. they just threw in a punch of people thinking ""hey see those characters, here's no background about any of them, no development, just relate to them, love them and don't question why they're popping out and disappearing for no reason what so ever."" You just don't skip on character building to show cartoons, which by the way offer nothing to the story, just depicts what's being narrated. I have to say though, Lucy Liu's scene is particularly good. also the whole troubled man - young prostitute thing is totally played out, and the movie doesn't add anything new for that matter, just the same predictable unoriginality that stretches out through the entire 98 minutes (which felt a lot longer)",2.0,dreamink92,2015/05/25,12,6
124,Taxi Driver,Suck On This!,"If you ask me - I think that Taxi Driver is one of those truly puzzling films that has been seriously over-rated (way-way-way out of proportion). It really has. With me giving Taxi Driver 5 stars, I think that I am actually being quite generous with that rating - 'Cause, at best, this film was an average production that seemed to contain an almost endless stream of filler-scenes where absolutely nothing of any interest ever happens. Now 40 years old, Taxi Driver (which contained some of the most inane dialogue and preposterous situations imaginable) certainly doesn't hold up very well today. And fresh-faced actor, Robert De Niro, as the psychotic vigilante, Travis Bickle (and his double-talking, dime-store philosophy) was pretty dull stuff, for the most part. And, speaking about Taxi Driver's climatic final showdown - I actually burst out laughing as I watched how badly this sequence was staged. And the over-dramatization of the violence, after the fact, was one of the worst examples of bad directing that I've seen in a mighty long time. All-in-all - This highly-praised picture barely managed to rise above mediocrity on only a few occasions. P.S. - If you want to see a real stand-out performance worthy of a ""Razzie"", check out Cybill Shepherd, as Betsy, the airhead political organizer.",5.0,strong-122-478885,2015/02/27,50,24
125,Interstellar,Boring Hollywood SOAP OPERA,"I am wondering if the people who write ""intertstellar"" 10-star reviews are actually sane, or if they base their opinion on a movie library completely deprived of everything that is sci-fi. Basically if the sic-fi component - most of which does not really happen until the end - is removed from the plot the movie by and large is a classic Hollywood soap opera. The worn-out rag of cliché family relations, all- American-dad, ""complicated"" love affair, unruly and a classic tomboy-girl, co-workers (more like co-idiots) who rebel and despite all common sense act irrationally, you know, to ""up the ante""... it really makes up 90% of this movie. Up until half- way trough I honestly considered walking away from this boring tragedy which is the lack of creative talent on the part of the script writers and director. There are also very obvious holes in the plot, and not just irregularities but direct contradictions that even the most obnoxious sic-fi movies at least try to amend somehow. I can not help but think that after watching Automata which was a breath of fresh air in many regards, this movie is like walking into a small toilet where someone just took a huge dump. It is literally that bad. What saves this movie by the skin of its teeth is the ending. So just watch that instead, because until then you could have just as well been watching an episode of Santa Barbara. Spolers about ridiculous plot holes (as if the soap part of the movie is not stressed enough): 1) The stupid Dust Bowl recycled. Seriously? I am not even going to try to explain this because I'd need to re-post have of Wikipedia here, but it does not work that way. Not in the past - not in the future. 2) The moment NASA abducts the main character and daughter and questions them. Seriously? Maybe they should also have shot them on sight? 3) NASA's facility is top secret! Right... in the age supposedly after the present, when there are drones and google maps, they manage to hide a huge facility in some old James Bond villain fashion. 4) ""LET'S GO TO ANOTHER GALAXY!"". OK if the movie shows a fairly conventional rocket, carrying a futuristic ""shuttle"", WHY for the love of all holy would anyone risk going there - instead of looking in our own? What, they really expected to have better luck there - than in our own? They already searched the entire Milky Way? And what's even better - it ""just so happens"" there is a planet like a stone's throw away from the black hole and is NOT being consumed by it, and somehow a black hole which is now proved to be a collapsed star is anything BUT a collapsed star? Why... let's just start diving down toilets, because you know, they are not full of s*** but are actual doorways to different dimensions! Like dimensions of dementia perhaps! 5) Saving the best for last - I did like the ending. Despite its absurdity I did like it. Almost cried - if I were a 14 year old girl with especially fragile psychology, but I digress. The ""machine"" that allows the main character to conviniently contact his daughter in the future- past, is built by... the very humanity he is trying to save, that survived, and built the machine in the future. Lord have mercy, I will try to explain this... So basically if we consider all major theories about time travel, in order to change the future one must go there and change it, right? But here the future changes the past, and that past is what changed the future with the help of the future that is changed in the past with the changed future's help.

126,The Green Mile,One of the best of the year.,"Frank Darabont's second feature adaptation of a Steven King novel proves to be just as touching and inspiring as his first. Like ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" ""The Green Mile"" is set in prison, though in the latter, it is death row that is portrayed. Tom Hanks, playing the compassionate head prison guard Paul Edgecomb, puts forth the type of performance that has made him the success that he is today. While Hanks is the ""name"" attached to ""The Green Mile,"" it is in fact Michael Clark Duncan that steals the audience's attention, and in the end, their hearts. His portrayal of John Coffey, a huge but loving death-row inmate, makes you want to believe in miracles. While some will complain of the length of the film (somewhere around 187 minutes), I on the other hand, felt that ""The Green Mile"" is more than capable of holding an audience's attention for the complete duration. Frank Darabont and Co. have brought us a gem, without a doubt.",10.0,psc-3,2000/02/07,11,6
127,The Green Mile,long superficial tale,"`The Green Mile,' since it is based on a Stephen King novel, emerges as a death row prison story with a sci-fi twist. Chances are the viewer will either be swept up in this tale of life, death and spiritual renewal involving a group of characters working and languishing in a 1930's prison cell block - or dismiss it as a prime example of sentimental hooey. Like the similar (and similarly overrated) Stephen King-inspired prison epic, `The Shawshank Redemption,' this new film provides far too sanitary and romanticized a vision of prison life to be either entirely convincing or particularly meaningful. Indeed, `The Green Mile' goes a step further into the realm of parable by ascribing to one of its main characters the power of miraculous healing. Unfortunately, however, a parable is, almost by definition, supposed to be short, pithy and to the point. The story here - which runs a presumptuous 3 hours and 8 minutes - is so overstuffed with subplots and subsidiary characters that it actually works to weaken the emotional effect generated by the plight facing John Coffey, the innocent messenger from God condemned to death, and Paul, the prison guard assigned to run the death row cell block, who comes to learn of Coffey's innocence. `The Green Mile' certainly has its heart in the right place, but it divides its world too evenly up into good guys and bad guys. Perhaps the decision to cast Tom Hanks in the leading role of Paul accounts for the fact that the character seems far too genial, soft-spoken and humanistic to be a man dedicating his life to dispatching convicted murderers to their just (or unjust) rewards. Coffey, a mountain of a man in the form of actor Michael Clarke Duncan, ranks as the oldest cliché of all: an uneducated, marginally imbecilic lug of a guy whose innocent, childlike heart and mind, though trapped inside a behemoth's body, provide the clean vessel through which God is able to work his wonders. Except for this last fact, Coffey's pedigree descends from a whole multitude of earlier characters, including Lennie in `Of Mice and Men' and even Frankenstein's monster. Is this possibly why `The Green Mile,' in deference to the former character, features a mouse in a prominent role? Similarly, one doubts it is mere coincidence that the crime for which Coffey is convicted is that of raping and murdering two little girls, an echo of Frankenstein - albeit, in this case, Coffey, of course, is innocent; after all, having him be guilty of the brutal murders would muddy up the moral waters and make it a lot harder to elicit tears from a sentimental, happily rheumy-eyed audience. Also, this allows the authors to pound home the Christ figure qualities of Coffey (John Coffey - JC - get it?) to an unsubtle fare-thee-well. In addition to dying innocently for another's sins, Coffey gets to heal the sick and smite the evildoers (the latter, more in keeping with Jehovah perhaps than with Christ per se). Nor are the filmmakers much more successful with their villains. Amidst all this amazing good will between condemned killers and supportive prison guards, there has to be some vinegar to cut the sweetness. This comes in the form of a too neatly balanced duo, one a guard, the other a far-from-model prisoner. The guard, Percy, is a craven, sadistic coward who delights in antagonizing the prisoners, taunting and torturing the men at the moment of execution and, most monstrously of all to the animal lovers in the audience, squashing a pet mouse on the eve of its owner's death. The evil prisoner, Wild Bill, provides a similar two-dimensional quality to his wickedness, serving as a too-obvious foil for the other pure-as-the-driven-snow condemned men. By so neatly divvying up the characters into clearly delineated categories of good and evil, the filmmakers rob their film of the moral complexity that might have lent it some real meaning. As to the film's rather startling and, initially unexpected, flights into fantasy, they serve mostly to further soften the edge of this already overly idealistic and mawkish story. `The Green Mile' is certainly not a `bad' film. It sports a number of excellent performances, generates some moments of genuine emotional power and, though languorous at times in its pacing, admirably refuses to hurtle ahead as it patiently gathers the strands of its story together. As with a good long novel, one approaches it with a sense of patience and goodwill. We want to give it the benefit of our attention. Therefore, we regret even more that the makers of the film too often settle for the easy path of cheap emotionalism and simpleminded sentimentality. Those of us willing to dedicate more than three precious hours to this particular cause deserve better.",,Buddy-51,2000/07/14,20,10
128,Goodfellas,Most grossly overrated movie ever,"By one of the most overrated directors ever. Mindless, incoherent, unceasing violence. Narration is almost always a bad idea in a movie and this movie is no exception. A little narration can be okay but when it is such a dominant part of a movie, it subtracts and doesn't add. But, more importantly, about half way through, I was sickened by all the violence AND depravity that I just couldn't stomach any more and basically ""skimmed"" (fast forwarding about 5 minutes to watch 30 seconds, repeatedly) to the end just trying to see something redeemable that would validate all the unwarranted hullabaloo that was given this piece of crap. The shame is that Scorcese has the ability to make great movies that include violence and violent personalities (Mean Streets, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull) but these are exceptions which everyone seems to remember and not the stinkers like The Color of Money, The Last Temptation of Christ or Goodfellas.",1.0,calcaylor,2006/01/02,160,60

Probably the most influential film of the last 20 years, it's got simply everything: amazing performances (especially Sam Jackson); it features some of the most quotable dialogue ever written; it has arguably one of the best non-original soundtracks ever - it's such a crazy, cool, fun ride that you feel stoned/dizzy/drunk after watching it eachtime.

133,Detachment,"Having notable stars, a sappy and melodramatic plot does not warrant a better film...","Having notable celebrities, an ""emotional"" storyline with a obvious, cliché message, tragic characters and cheap sappy music playing in the background and other bait that of which the Oscars or any award show would consume is the case of The Detachment, a 2011 indie film which won several awards. We often see this type of deprived, artistic and emotional piece about a substitute teacher trying to help illiterate or with poor grades, poor or terrible school filled with stereotypes and bullies that at first, terrorized and bully the school and having one teacher turn it around in the end, well the director seems to get a great idea to make another annoying high school drama film or more specifically a teen- angst film. Tony Kaye who is known for American History X tries to convey his elements of his previous films and try to make the most melodramatic and artistic movie that seems to be derived from other movies related to this. I am not sure what the director is thinking, the fact that we see thousands of films like these and people tend to get suckered into the bad melodrama and the obvious plot lines with poorly drawn characters with terrific actors performing them. I mean how did they get people like Adrian Brody, Christina Hendricks, Bryan Cranston, James Caan to even Lucy Liu — seriously, she went out of her way to get this terrible role? I felt like this was just a money deal for them and they were just told what to do. I don't want to begin what the film is about, I seriously doubt the plot would even care less as well; it's about a clinically-depressed substitute teacher who's been moved to the most illiterate and bad school that of which is being sold off (or trying to) by Mr. Mattias (Isiah Whitlock Jr.). Adrian Brody plays the substitute teacher, Henry Barthes who is this clinically depressed lemon (as one of the students called him) who isn't like the other teachers although the fact that the other teachers don't fend off the bullies are just as much as him. Anyways, after his father had passed away, he lives a fellow irritating, homeless female student, Erica (Sami Gayle) and has to teach a class full of stereotypes and bullies who try to imitate and scare off the teacher. The film is mainly about this substitute teacher drifting off from classroom to classroom attempting to connect with his fellow students while dealing his own personal demons as well. Oh there is also a overweight artsy student that loves photography, taking pictures of Mr. Wiatt (Tim Blake Nelson) who has gone insane probably because of all the bullying. The film consists of so much stereotypes and bullies that I am baffled why people actually like this movie. I mean, the first few minutes when the Brody character comes to class, there is a stereotypical black person with an attitude problem that threatens him and in the next scene, we also see other teacher, Ms. Sarah Madison played by Hendricks being spit on and threaten to get ""gang-bang"" by a black girl. It's really baffling that people think this film is ""powerful and gripping"" even though the writers of this film clearly play the ""racism card"" of having all to most black people in the school that have either an attitude problem or presumably be in some gang threatening teachers. It's like every teacher in the school are wimps that don't stand against them, even other movies that related to this plot have gangs in the school and there are less emotional people in those movies. I cannot stress how irritating this movie is, everyone in this movie is either an annoying, irritating human being or some pathetic, emotional person that does not have an inch of hope on improving their students. I like the fact that the director try to convey Brody's character feelings through him looking straight at the camera and the cheaply done artistic chalkboard drawings that attempts to convey some emotional impact. It felt like the director just wanted to have this movie be drenched with awards and have a melodramatic message and theme, terribly implemented to make it dramatic to the audience. In the end, people who think this movie is even good is either have bad taste in movies or some sucker who get cheaply suckered into the melodrama and say things like ""the movie has a gripping subtext that of which could easily related to real life or not."" So the fact that everyone in this film is some kind of bully or some helpless person relates to a bunch of people online? Wow, where did I see that be implement in a dozen movies that has been produced years ago?

Not the composition of each shot, mind you, but the stock that Haggis uses shows soft blues and hypnotic reds that far outdo the soft-focus artism of the actual movie. This, and the fact that the sounds of dry-heaving block out many of the most painful tracts of dialog, granted it its one star.

138,Hotel Transylvania,"Unsubstantial Fluff, but Should Please Kids","In a groundbreaking (and diverse) age of animation where Disney is no longer the sole juggernaut, competing houses Pixar, DreamWorks, Aardman, Laika and Studio Ghibli (and to a lesser extent Fox's Blue Sky Studios) continually offer audiences compelling fare that often break any preconceived notions that this overarching genre is simply for children. Struggling to find its foothold in the industry as DreamWorks once did is Sony Pictures Animation, purveyor of fare including Open Season and The Smurfs – an entity which seems decidedly stuck in the past. Offering up slapstick-laden fluff of the lowest common denominator, the products flowing from this studio (even at their most comforting and brisk) are insubstantial and almost always offer nothing but a fleeting diversion. Hotel Transylvania is a chief offender when it comes to all the issues plaguing mainstream animation today and in a number of ways seems like a significant step back from the frisky energy boasted from 2009's Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs. At the very least that well-received film had the audacity to adapt a tricky children's novel, whereas this Adam Sandler-led vehicle seems as archaic as the gloomy manor in which this film is set. However, not to be a complete ogre (a creature which ironically does not make an appearance amongst the mummies, gremlins and more famous monsters and ghouls), Hotel Transylvania does not even seem to be reaching for anything beyond mediocrity and seems simply intent on pleasing a young audience for 90 minutes – a basic merit I cannot entirely dismiss. Hotel Transylvania is not offensively bland and frankly, the easy-going nature of the production is likely to please its target demographic while keeping accompanying parents rooted in their seats (this is no ""Oogieloves,"" or so I can surmise). Sidestepping the inconsequential nature of Hotel Transylvania's execution, a significant failing of the film comes via the misleading trailers which essentially play out as a bait and switch. The promotional material promises a comedy of errors whereby a human stumbles upon a retreat for the fantastical. Hilarity would hopefully ensure as Adam Sandler's Dracula tries to hide the true nature of his abode (and its many odd residents). However, that portion of the film plays out almost immediately and what we're left with is the well-worn overprotective parent story as the hotel's newcomer falls for the famed vamp's daughter, Mavis. Adding a level of creepiness to the whole ordeal (and I don't mean of the horror variety) is that Mavis is 118 years old and is essentially being kept in solitude by her father. Freud, eat your heart out. That central plot thread of Hotel Transylvania is hopelessly clichéd and so overdone it adds yet another layer of dust to this proverbial dinosaur of a movie. One could name a few dozen films in a matter of seconds that utilize that trope as its driving comedic force and alas it's not even the first animated flick of the year to do so. Pixar's Brave also employed the overbearing (at points literally ""over-bearing"") parent shtick and unsurprisingly it turned out to be one of the weakest and most insubstantial entries in the studio's canon. Hotel Transylvania with its simplified animation, less successful humor and weaker voice cast is another step down on that disappointment. With the aforementioned voice cast, an impressive line-up has nevertheless been assembled. Sandler is the classical Transylvanian blood-sucker – velcome! – Selena Gomez his daughter and the guests attending her birthday include Andy Samberg (as the human presence) Kevin James, Steve Buscemi, David Spade, Jon Lovitz, Rob Riggle, Fran Drescher and Cee lo Green. Samberg is among the funnier of the bunch and nobody does Buscemi quite like Buscemi, but regardless of the talent on hand, there is not a memorable performance between them. Nobody is offensively awful but when the material isn't failing them OK the material fails them. Bah, but enough with the hate as this is not in fact a scathing review and as a whole Hotel Transylvania does not make the damning sin of being boring, it certainly proves Sandler is capable of starring in a movie not of the atrocious variety. There are a number of jokes in David I. Stern's screenplay that hit home (even when you can see them coming) and there is something charming about seeing all these creatures share the screen in a cheery monster mash-up. It's like a more comedic The Expendables done via The Brothers Grimm. When all is said and done, Hotel Transylvania is inoffensive fluff that will be better served in a home video capacity than it ever will on the big screen. There is simply no ""must see"" element to this film. A little too noisy and a lot too bland, Sandler and co. should be able to please nearly every child in the audience but will never have the power to pull the child out of an older crowd. 5.5/10",5.0,Simon_Says_Movies,2012/09/29,11,6
139,Goodfellas,"Slick, flashy, often brilliant, yet cannot make you give a hoot about its characters","Goodfellas is a technically impressive film and interesting to review largely because of the huge following it has amongst film critics and Martin Scorsese fanatics alike, most of whom reverentially believe it is his best work and they may be correct. The story based on a novel by Nicholas Pileggi chronicles the rise through the ranks of the Mafia of Irish-Sicilian Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), who has always wanted to be a gangster since he was a kid, and finds his wish granted. We follow him from a rambunctious teen to his first arrest, his marriage to Jewish wife Karen (Lorraine Bracco) through to their fall into drugs, and finally as an informer prior to entry into the Witness Protection Program. The film has a dry sense of humor and is technically and visually amazing. Scorsese loves the mobster milieu and is obviously working in his element here with a nicely picked cast. The attention to detail, the camera work, the costumes, the choice of music is all well thought out to the most intimate minutiae. The film is a fairly fascinating peek at life inside the Mafia. Scorsese allows events to unfold believably and the moments near the end where Henry and Karen become increasingly paranoid that they are under surveillance, complete with jittery, over bright intense camera work that heightens their unease, is arguably some of Scorsese's best work. The acting is fairly solid. Liotta manages to hold things together as the focal character and he gets nice support from Bracco. DeNiro manages a dignified turn as Liotta's mentor and friend. Joe Pesci won the Oscar as the psychotic killer Tommy DeVito. He is utilized well enough here to overlook the fact that it is basically the same performance he gives in everything else. Yet as amazing as the film is, it still has its drawbacks that prevent it from becoming the classic that many of its admirers would have you believe. As fascinating as Goodfellas is, I actually find Scorsese's similarly themed subsequent work Casino just as impressive technically, yet far more interesting in that it tells its tale using the backdrop of the formation of gambling mecca Las Vegas. I realize that I am in the minority with that view, but there it is. Yet most notable of all is that Goodfellas seems utterly incapable of connecting on an emotional level with the viewer. The superior Godfather films featured similar themes and focused on characters capable of shocking acts of violence, yet managed to connect on an emotional level so that we had some concern for the players. By contrast, at the end of Goodfellas, as brilliant as I thought some of the direction and technical aspects were, I found that I did not give a damn what happened to any of the characters on screen, including Henry and Karen. I was completely indifferent to whether they lived, died, escaped, etc. And this issue makes for a somewhat empty viewing experience. 1990 was a very interesting film year. Coppola released his last Godfather film that year. Although it got an Oscar nod, critics largely overlooked it in favor of Goodfellas due to the fact that it is not on the same level as its predecessors. There is no question Godfather III is a flawed film, but it is also more emotionally rich than Goodfellas and any one of its flaws is more interesting to discuss at length than any of Goodfellas successes. Conversely, critics and Scorsese fans have spilled gallons of ink over the ""injustice"" of Dances With Wolves winning the Best Picture over Goodfellas, but it is not hard to see why it did. DWW in its own right is just as technically impressive as Goodfellas (maybe even more so considering its director was an amateur with a passionate vision), but DWW connects emotionally with the viewer in a far more powerful way than Goodfellas ever does. At the end of DWW and Godfather III, I had to know what happened with those characters. At the end of Goodfellas, not so much. What Scorsese has achieved is certainly noteworthy and makes for a very good, solid gangster film, but most definitely not a masterpiece. It is slick, flashy and technically well done (sometimes even brilliant), but its inability to make me give a damn about any of its characters is a huge stumbling block.",7.0,mnpollio,2012/04/24,25,13
140,Moon,"Unforgettable scenes, interesting characters","Haunting, thought-provoking film filled with extraordinary images and scenes. Builds to a stunning climax that ties together the various loose ends very well. Some plot issues remain muddled to me even after two viewings: the bearded man in the dream, the tooth, the purpose of the pylon-disabling, whether Gertie intended to leave a palimpsest in presumably cleaning the smiley faces. Scenes of Earth hanging on horizon, or the vehicles crawling around the zoom, are as well-done as any similar shots since Alien. Acting was quite solid, differential characters and character traits being well delineated and separated. Character of Gertie especially powerful, the soul of the troubled robot quietly coming clear in Spacey's understated delivery.",10.0,rbnn,2009/06/20,10,5

Maybe it is a comedy and I missed the whole premise. If this was made as some serious drama or horror movie I can't understand why they would have the police who are central characters act like teenage girls in a Friday 13th movie. The scenes that are made to be a suspenseful fail because of the sissy behavior of our hero cops. When our police are faced with danger you might expect a weapon to be drawn certainly not the reactions we are presented with. Screaming, running away, tripping and falling down.

142,Moon,Silly...,"It baffles me that so many people find this movie to be an enjoyable watch. The movie moves at a snails pace, is extremely predictable and steals in a too obvious manor from far superior predecessors. Rockwell turns in an uneven performance but it's always nice to catch the highly talented Kevin Spacey, even if he literally phoned it in this time. The story could have worked had it been told in a shorter amount of time, had it skipped the many absurd lapses in logic it needlessly featured and had it dared to sire some original thought. As it stands, the story has been told many times before and in Moon just lacks the zest, intelligence and imagination to pull it of. With a script too repetitive and a lazy score (sounding exactly like the crap I made in the 80's with my first sequencer, perhaps I should sue for plagiary) very poorly timed in places, the movie became sort of annoying especially considering the potential it had. Whatever was left to enjoy was surely ruined by the incredibly dumb and completely nonsensical ending where a man survives a trip through space being exposed to G- forces which in reality would result in a spacesuit filled with a gory mash of meat and bones. With a reasonable production value nonetheless, Moon remains a simplified 2001 and Solaris redux for the MTV generation with apparently on par appreciation.

145,Pulp Fiction,One of the best movies of the century!,"If you think ""Pulp Fiction"" is brilliant, you're wrong. It's more than that. It's a milestone in the history of film making. It's already a classic. But why? Because of the many ""f"" words, or maybe because of the brain and skull pieces on the rear window of a car? No, that's surely not the point (unfortunately some other users - fortunately the minority - don't get it). Tarantino has made a movie that's someway different from many other action, gangster or crime movies. What's so different? He knows the subject of the movie is ""cool"", he knows it's a product of mass culture, and he even likes it by himself. But he smiles at it and tells three great stories with a lot of irony. And this irony is the first point. The second point is that he gave souls to extremely schematic characters. They surely aren't another action heroes who you forget as fast as you can twinkle. They are human beings like we are, talking about Burger King and McDonalds, about TV series and a foot massage. They just earn their money with killing others or selling drugs. What else is so great about ""Pulp Fiction""? It's the acting, the directing, the cinematography, the soundtrack, the sense of humour and the whole rest. In my opinion it's all worth nothing less than a 10 out of 10. A masterpiece.",10.0,Luke-20,1998/12/30,1008,686
146,Moon,It always feels like somebody's watching Rockwell,"Who could you watch in a movie if they were roughly the only actor in the film? It worked with Tom Hanks. ""I am Legend"" was a hit for Will Smith. Could probably work with Denzel Washington and maybe Brad Pitt. Who came up with the idea that Sam Rockwell, eternally under-appreciated lead actor often used in supporting roles, could pull off such a feat? If you're a Rockwell fan (I am), you know he's up to the task. He delivers big-time as a harvester of energy resources on the Moon, who encounters an unusual, yet familiar individual. There are obvious tips of the hat to ""2001"" all over this movie, but that's a good film to emulate. Director Duncan Jones does a great job at establishing the isolation of Rockwell's character, Sam Bell, left on the Moon to communicate solely with order-keeping robot, GERTY, voiced by Kevin Spacey. Let's go into everything above in depth. ""Moon"" doesn't pack the budget of a film like ""District 9"" or ""Star Trek"", but successfully creates a plausible Moon surface, lunar domicile and hi-tech mining machines. Its main asset is not in whiz-bang visuals, but in creating an eerie existence for its main character, Sam. In doing so, ""Moon"" hearkens back to a not-often-visited form of science fiction – the thinking-man's sci-fi genre. Think of the great movies in this class – ""The Thing"", ""Outland"" and ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"". That's good company, and ""Moon"" belongs there as an excellent mood piece. Unsurprisingly, Sam deals mostly with boredom and restlessness as he finishes up a three-year contract mining The Moon for Helium-3. Space being a lonely place isn't exactly a new concept, but it's handled well here as Sam's reminiscence and longing for a return to his family is coupled with a mysterious (and perhaps nefarious) company that has hired his services. GERTY is Sam's only friend, but being a computer, GERTY is more interested in the tasks at hand than anyone's well-being. I know what you're saying, ""Yeah, that's 2001"". And you're right. I think the thing that makes ""Moon"" unique is Rockwell. I think this film benefits from his status as a not-so-leading man. He can embody all the different sides of Sam Bell with equal ease and a great sense of humor. All that time alone on The Moon allows Sam to get to know himself, and he gets more of an extra opportunity than most of us. And as Sam discovers how Lunar Industries is using questionable methods to prolong his employment, Rockwell brings real pathos to his situation, and makes ""Moon"", in the end, a moving film as well as intriguing science fiction. So, with all this praise, why not four stars? I thought the ending was a little abrupt. When such care is taken to build up this plot to the climax, I wanted a little more time with the denouement and a cigarette. Finally, all the homage, in the end, makes ""Moon"" a touch too familiar to take me completely out of my comfort zone like ""Blade Runner"" or ""Dark City"" did. I think Duncan Jones proves with ""Moon"" that he can graduate successfully from commercials to features, and in the future, he won't need deference to great works in order to make his own.",7.0,movieguysla,2009/10/05,6,4
147,Horrible Bosses 2,Nick Kurt Dale,"Three years after the widely successful and good film, a sequel has been made. Who didn't see this coming, right? While the idea of the first film falls apart in this film, this film still delivers some good laughs, and is about on par with the quality of the first film. The original film gets the edge because it was something different, while this is mostly more of the same. The following is my review of Horrible Bosses 2. This sequel was written by Sean Anders, John Morris, Jonathan M. Goldstein, and John Francis Daley. Anders and Morris did not work on the original film, and their recent work was Dumb and Dumber To, which was recently released. The story while not really involving much of the plot of the first film, and thus making the title of the film worthless, is still fairly interesting. The three guys are starting a business for themselves having the idea to create the Shower Buddy. When things go south on a deal, they all decide to kidnap the son of the man they have been dealing with. There are some twists and turns, and some very good subtle jokes that keep the movie fresh in my opinion. While originality has to be a factor for a sequel, we really don't get much of that here except when it comes to the jokes, which is why I say this film is almost on par with the first film. Overall, the writers have delivered a good story and some amazing jokes. The film was directed by Sean Anders(also writer). He recently directed the Adam Sandler film That's My Boy and also Sex Drive. While the overall film doesn't contain much that would warrant major acclaim, since it is a comedy film, there are some action scenes that look amazingly well shot without much CG. Getting the actors to work together so well is another key aspect, and Anders really is able to bring back those great aspects from the first film. Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikis, Charlie Day lead the film as they did in the first movie, and they are just as hilarious as they were in the first film. I believe the subtle jokes in this film really give it that edge that most sequels don't have in this genre. With some good performances from secondary actors like Christoph Waltz, Chris Pine, Kevin Spacey, and Jennifer Aniston, this is one of the better acted comedy films. In closing, while there is not much in terms of originality compared to the first film, the jokes flow nicely and with a more subtle approach, it gives the film what it needs to be near the quality of the first film. Fans of the first film should be rushing out to see this film, while comedy fans in general should be excited for it as well. If you haven't seen the first film yet, that would be a good start, but it really isn't a must to see before viewing this film. Going into the film I heard so many critics saying they thought it was too far over the top, and in some aspects they are correct, but so was the first film. Major critics are often wrong and this is another example of them being wrong. Horrible Bosses 2 is one of the better comedies of 2014. 7/10",7.0,CowherPowerForever,2014/11/30,14,8

152,Crash,Crash is a non-LA persons view of LA.,"I've lived in LA for 13 years of my young adult life, on the Westside and also in depressed neighborhoods near downtown (Echo Park, home of the Rampart Division scandal and previously the precinct with the highest murder rate in the US) and I have to say that this is not the LA that I know. In watching the film it looks like some non-Californian's, non-LA person's perspective on race relations in LA. The characters are exaggerations, the overwhelming focus on black/white relations obscures the multi-racial fabric of the LA landscape, and the Asian characters (eg. one is smuggling Chinese illegal aliens, and another is screaming racial epithets) are the worst kind of stereotyping. The only portrayal in the film that is accurate is of the corrupt cops, which as anyone who lived through the Rodney King years 1992 will tell you are all too real. But then the film turned around and offered redemption for that bastard cop by allowing him to rescue the same woman he molested/raped? What kind of crap is this! That's not even counting the stylistic choices made in the film to try to make LA look like Chicago and New York, with people wearing scarves and such and having it snow in the city (as if that would ever happen!). People in LA rarely ever wear scarves, because it is rarely that cold, and the way they made the characters do this shows that this film is made about other cities in the US, and only used LA as the background because of the controversial nature of the 1992 riots. I would have to say that based on my experiences in LA I have seldom seen people engage in outright racial slurs, because they know they will get beat down pretty quickly. Additionally, for Angelenos who have grown up in local multiracial high schools, the mere fact that people grow up living next to and learning with people of many different types encourages greater understanding of difference. If there are racial issues at certain local high schools, they are more often caused by gang conflict over turf issues than by internal prejudice. Maybe the racial dynamics mentioned in the film hold for people in other cities, but they're not walking the same streets, riding the same buses, and talking to the same people in the community as I have. In fact, I would argue that the biggest problems are caused by all the starry eyed hillbillies that move to LA from places outside of California and bring their prejudices with them. This movie is terrible, and the fact that people have made a big fuss about it is evidence of how out of touch people are with LA.",,roninred,2006/03/02,96,58
153,The Chorus,Inspiring,"Barratier does very well in balancing the comedic parts with the more serious tone in the film. The antics of the boys and their overall attitude towards any figure of authority seems to be quite characteristic of a boy's boarding school. The story is simplistic while also containing some surprising elements. It has a somewhat predictable story progression but not the ending I was expecting. Also, I did not expect how dark some of the children could be. Mondain, comes (I think) from a psychiatric or juvenile ward, and so his behaviour is wildly different. In contrast, Pépinot is a quiet and introverted young boy who is known as the cute one. Also, the chemistry between each of the actors is great, and the boys do a great job at playing boys. Though I am not used to the type of songs they sing, it is undeniably beautiful. I'm not sure about the other children, but Maunier can actually sing (and has pursued a music career since then) and so that was his real voice in the film. It is amazing how well he can sing from such a young age, and Jugnot is excellent at portraying his character's pride and amazement at discovering this hidden gem. His eyes are full of emotion when watching Maunier sing, and it transcends the scene, making the audience feel it too. Overall, an inspiring film about the hardships of boarding schools, and the prefect who brought music into the boys' lives.",7.0,nicolechan916,2016/02/27,0,0
154,Goodfellas,Cinematic perfection (minor spoilers),"This film shows us a life lived to the excess. The tone of the film suggests more a study of social behavior than outright gangster film, I have even heard it being classed as a modern day noir, whatever, it's brilliant. The acting is amazing, the cinematography is top bracket, the music is heavenly (in it's depiction of Hell). Scorcese was born to make this movie, it's impossible to study it the first few times you watch because it sweeps you up and dumps you down at the end. It leaves you breathless. There is brutal violence, drug use, and colourful language, but there's no use complaining because this is the mafia, these are bad people, what do you expect? Told in flashback it is based on the story of Henry Hill, a boy who grows up dreaming of making it in the Mafia, he works his way into the higher ranks of the organised crime syndicate and through a stunning series of set pieces his coke-addled paranoia shows us his downfall and eventual fate. There are various voice-overs to give the action a sense of perspective, but there are so many things going on it's best just to let it flow. De Niro and Pesci are at the top of their game, and the supporting cast give this film a weight unmatched by many.

158,Spider-Man 2,best comic movie ever,"Spider-Man 2"" is the best comic book superhero movie made to date, and not simply by default. The story and screenplay come from Alfred Gough and Miles Millar (co-creators of ""Smallville""), Michael Chabon (author of ""Wonder Boys""), and Alvin Sargent (Oscar winner for ""Julia"" and ""Ordinary People""), and more than any other film in this genre it is true to the character and what made him Marvel Comics' most popular superhero in the 1960s. I teach a unit on Spider-Man in my Pop Culture class where we compare the original Stan Lee & Steve Ditko stories to what is being published today and my students have to deal with the key elements of the comic book. This time around Sam Raimi has those elements nailed big time. The story picks up two years after the first film, which is reprised through artwork by Alex Ross during the title sequences. Peter (Tobey Maguire) is now in college, working a part time job, fighting crime, and generally making a mess of everything. Being Spider-Man is a burden and it is beating Peter Parker down. He loses his job, his grades are slipping, and even his powers seem to be leaving him. He still loves Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), but all he can envision is a life where his enemies would threaten her life and he has to endure seeing her picture on billboards and posters all over New York City. It becomes clear that our hero is coming to a cross-roads in his life, but we have no idea what will be the final straw, as it could be anything from the bank foreclosing on the house of Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) or Dr. Curt Connors (Dylan Baker) flunking him to J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons) really firing him from the ""Daily Bugle"" to Mary Jane ending up with some other guy (Daniel Gillies). What made Spider-Man endearing was that he was the victim of such bad luck. With power comes great responsibility but you would think a guy could catch a break now and then. There is a point where a bruised Peter tries to make his way home and as he reaches out to steady himself against a parked car you KNOW that as soon as he touches it a car alarm goes off. Spider-Man endures a lot of slings and arrows in this film (e.g., Aunt May never told him how to do laundry) and all the while the gods just look down and laugh. The Green Goblin was something of the ultimate villain for Spider-Man because he was the one who learned the web-slinger's secret identity. But the consensus of my students each semester is that Doctor Octopus is the best Spider-Man villain. Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) intends to make nuclear fusion work and is employed by Harry Osborn (James Franco), who dreams of making a fortune during the day and of killing Spider-Man to avenge his father at night. Of course things go horribly wrong, and the four metal tentacles that Octavius has created are now fused to his body and have driven him insane. We have all seen the trailer for ""Spider-Man 2"" and the scene where Doc Ock interupts a potentially tender moment between Peter and Mary Jane by throwing a car through a window at them. This must happen over an hour into the film but it starts off a series of fantastic computer generated fights between the hero and the villain. The reason for this and why the pairing is so perfect is that Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus can both fight on the vertical axis as well as the horizontal. These two go at each other on the side of buildings and falling through the air as well as on top, on the sides, and through the middle of a subway train. Then you throw into the mix that Doc Ock can be carrying off someone Peter loves and still have three mechanical arms pounding away at Spider-Man. More importantly, when Spider-Man travels around by his webbing in this film it no longer looks like something we would expect from a Saturday morning cartoon. But the conflict between Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus is only one of a half dozen that provide the interpersonal web of problems closing in on Peter and the way they all fit together gives ""Spider-Man 2"" a weight hitherto unsuspected in superhero movies. This point is best evidence by the fact that Aunt May is major supporting character in the film just as she is in the comic book. There were always two women in Peter Parker's life and the one constant was always Aunt May.",10.0,jalal_devil2004,2005/06/21,14,9

I didn't bother to click few pages to read the user reviews seriously my bad, I wish I would have time to read few pages instead of blindly believing the some paid reviews and paid rating by IMDb.My cousins were pulling and honking car horn waiting outside so I just gave in. Lesson learned. I wont trust on IMDb ratings again. Also, I was not furious on my money or my time being wasted like that, but did anyone ever thought giving 8+ ratings would put this movie in the league of Godfather,The Shawshank Redemption,The Lord of the ring series,Good Fellas, Star wars and likes, its utter disrespect and blasphemous for these great movies to put this good for nothing movie and listed and counted among them. People might be thinking or comment that this reviews comes from insensitive person or I don't have heart. Seriously my cousins and I seriously tried to cry but we all end up laughing along with few other fellow like us and also got the wrath of some bull...teenagers who saw this movie as some sacred text like Bible being translate to movie? OK, now come to the story our pretty Shailene Woodly got cancer and dying very depressive, but why every time they end up in support group and all the good Christian and the worst of the movie was not her, in fact she save the movie else we all would be out of cinema hall in first 15 minutes, the worst part of the movie was that Chocolate face Ansel Elgort seriously this guy can only be her brother and he should stick to brother's and kind of looks because he is so emotionless even on most emotional scenes. He act like he is acting badly. The cigarette scenes were most terrific. Then comes the author part, seriously! a author of some unknown book are in seclusion and drunkard, he was not John Gresham or Stephen kings or some Pulitzer Prize winner author who hasn't got any good book and now in hiding...Not only that the author has no respect for cancer patients or something like that he was rude, drinking all the time and insult our protagonist. Next comes our 18 years old so called virgin boy had sex where? Well, at Anne Frank memorial and that was highly encouraged by applauding strangers, I mean seriously!!!!How much pain one can bear does this director has any idea? So the worst is not yet over by this time we were so bored but to keep our self busy and in fact start enjoying the comedy, so we start playing games who will die first Elgort or Shailene...so by this time I know so much about script I told them what would going to happen and who will die first and how it ends...surprisingly that's what happen, because the script and screen play was so shallow any 6 years old could predict.

164,Goodfellas,"Wiseguy mayhem, an artistic triumph but occasionally off-putting","Martin Scorsese-directed modern-day mobster drama adapted from Nicholas Pileggi's book ""Wiseguy"" by Scorsese and Pileggi involves Brooklyn youth in 1955 who gets drawn into the gangster lifestyle, first as their gopher, later as a major player. Joe Pesci is frightening as a psychotic ball-buster and won a Supporting Actor Oscar, yet Ray Liotta is even better in the central role, and Lorraine Bracco is excellent as Liotta's wife. Exceptionally well-made film is gratuitous in its usage of a certain expletive and cannot overcome one major obstacle: despite its attempts to show the ugliness of Mafia life, the movie is constantly undermined by a distinct romanticism of its own violence. The infrequent narration by both Liotta and Bracco is a distraction, as we are often being told exactly what we're seeing on the screen, but the creeping paranoia is palpable and the drama played out is disturbing and gripping. **1/2 from ****",6.0,moonspinner55,2006/05/19,26,11
165,Death of a Salesman,terrific Hoffman,"Struggling traveling salesman Willy Loman (Dustin Hoffman) returns home to his loving wife Linda (Kate Reid). His former football star son Biff (John Malkovich) has returned home after failing in the outside world. His younger son Happy (Stephen Lang) worships his older brother. In contrast, his neighbor Charley (Charles Durning) raised successful nerdy son Bernard. His dead older brother Ben became a diamond tycoon from nothing and his ideal American dream. His boss Howard Wagner fires him despite his years of service. The style is strip down minimalist. It faithfully does the Arthur Miller play. Its greatness comes from the terrific Hoffman performance. The rest of cast is no slouch. It's TV doing high class American culture and doing it well.

166,Intermission,Uneven Flick About Mostly Boring People Replete With Inaudible Dialogue,"""Intermission,"" a story about the inter-related lives of a group of Dublin men and women, mostly either working- or criminal class, has its moments but overall it's a disappointment. The story is weak. Episodes of marital infidelity, searching for love, random child-engineered mayhem, a stupid detective in search of boob tube fame and a very conventional crime caper don't really come together. Caricatures rather than characters dominate the movie. Colin Farrell pulls off his role as a thug with no personal attributes- it's impossible to care about him or even ponder his brutal and dumb acts. Shirley Henderson as a lonely young woman is the best actor in ""Intermission."" A Scot in the current ""Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself,"" she's convincing here as an Irish lass going on age from thirty to spinsterhood (a word still in vogue in Eire). Kelly MacDonald, an up and coming actress with real ability, is largely wasted as a gal who abandons her boyfriend for a colorless bank manager who leaves his anguished wife for sweeter bedsheets. She's beautiful but transparently vacuous. Perhaps this film resonates with Irish, and even U.K., audiences but I found it disappointing. The theater's excellent sound system merely amplified the incomprehensibility and audibility of much speech. It's one thing not to understand the argot of today's urban Irish working class. It's something else to be trying to figure out what you're hearing during much of a movie. 4/10.",4.0,lawprof,2004/04/09,32,15
167,Horrible Bosses 2,It works because the story drives the humour rather than the other way around,"It's always interesting to see how comedy series go about their sequels. 'The Hangover Part 2' took the route of making an almost exact replica of the original, simply in another country and was almost universally panned for it (although personally I still quite enjoyed it). Then with their third entry in the series they went almost the entirely opposite direction (to the point where there wasn't even a hangover in the film) and got a more positive response. Go figure. Horrible Bosses 2 seems to have changed things up just enough to keep people satisfied while still staying very true to the format that made the original so good. The main three have tremendous chemistry, there's no doubt about it. Every scene is so much fun. Then you throw in the brilliant cameos from Jennifer Aniston, Kevin Spacey, Chris Pine, Christoph Waltz, Jamie Foxx (the best of the lot) etc. and you have a very enjoyable film. It's actually a very smart movie and could easily have been tweaked here and there to make a reasonable thriller out of it. And that's what drives each scene (much like the previously mention 'The Hangover') and keeps the humour fresh and driven rather than forced. A very good sequel all up and I look forward to the third edition I'm sure is just around the corner.",8.0,jtindahouse,2014/12/26,31,14
168,The Fault in Our Stars,"Great story, but not the book.","I will be the first to say that the book by John Green captivated me. I went to the Chapel Hill Public Library to do some Wojdylo Social Media work and ended up seeing this book on the ""must reads"" shelf right before Christmas. I read the book in about three hours and I knew I had to watch the movie. I went to Twitter and asked my friends their thoughts on the book. They all loved it. I had to wait six months to see the movie. I absolutely loved the book and the movie was outstanding. The one thing I did not like about the movie was the fact that Augustus' prior relationship was never mentioned in the movie. This was one of the main parts of the plot of the book as he did not want to hurt someone else. That did not play out at all in the movie. Other than that, I felt as if the movie did a great job of telling the story of Hazel Grace Lancaster and Augustus Waters. There were moments in which there were tears in my eyes and there were moments that I could not help but laugh. I honestly wish I would have read the book closer to the movie release because I forgot some of the amazing lines and the movie did not do them justice. There is just something special about reading that great one liner. As with most movie adaptations from books, I would strongly suggest reading the book first. The movie is well above average and even great in my book, no pun intended. Let me know what you thought of the movie!",9.0,JesseWojdylo,2014/07/25,15,9

It is true like movie tells us- it is difficult to find miracle or better that miracle find us, but if we do, we don't believe in it or worse we destroy(kill) it!

We see the cruelty of separating whale calves from their mothers and listening to the howls of the mothers' grief. This film is mostly about the human failings that allow such barbarism to continue unchecked. Informative, impassioned and damningly indicting.

Bateman, Sudeikis,and Day are still great in comic form, the three have such funny chemistry, and the zany misadventure they get themselves into is always fun to watch. Jennifer Aniston and Jamie Fox reprising there roles from the first one are also fun. But Chris Pine who looks like he's having too much fun here, really overdoes it in a few scenes.

174,Primal Fear,Excellent film,"My fiancée suggested I watch this, and when we found it for sale at a good price, we bought it right away. I must say, this is a marvelous and quite well-crafted film. The acting is top-notch all the way. Gere manages to make us care about a type of person that few like. O'Quinn is somewhat underused, as he is a magnificent actor, but apart from that, everyone gets a good chance to perform well, and they all live up to it. I would have to say that I now have a completely new-found respect for Norton... and I had a great deal of respect for him before even knowing of this movie. The plot is well-written and has good layers to it, especially for a movie of two hours(running time does put quite a limitation on the level of detail and intricacy of the plot). The pacing is really good, the movie never moves neither too fast nor too slowly. This is the second film I've seen that was directed by Gregory Hoblit... and the second that I've really, really liked(both have received 8's by yours truly, and very deservedly so), so I will most definitely keep an eye out for any future works by the man. I haven't read the book of the same title that this is based on, so I can't comment on how accurate and true to the tone this film is. I urge anyone intending to watch this to steer clear of any spoilers on it, because the plot is too good to ruin. I won't detail it here, I'll just say that the film has many court-room scenes, and deals with a very violent crime(and it's not the only occurrence in the film of a violent nature). For that same reason, since it is depicted graphically in the film(but not too much... there was nothing gratuitous about it), I urge anyone who believes they may not be able to handle seeing such to consider if they should watch it or not. There is also quite a bit of language, as well as a brief scene of sexual nature, so if such bother you, you may want to watch a censored version, if you are interested in seeing it. I recommend this very warmly to any fan of court-room dramas and thrillers. If you enjoy an engaging and involving thriller with surprises, this is the movie for you. 8/10",8.0,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,2007/04/19,73,63
175,Primal Fear,Norton's Explosive Debut,"I understand that we all have different tastes when it comes to movies and that we all see greatness in a variety of ways. I will be the first to admit that I was totally lost when watching the Matrix and possess absolutely no desire to sit through the Lord Of The Rings trilogy. I am not trying to take anything away from those movies because I also understand that a large percent of the movie viewing population see the Matrix and LOTR trilogies as masterpieces. That being said, it is beyond me why Primal Fear never made it to more people's ""best"" or ""greatest"" lists. It has received positive ratings on this website, but overall the movie enjoyed very quiet success. This movie is spectacular from start to finish. The ending is a doozy and Edward Norton's performance is Oscar worthy. Not only did his performance blind side me (who the hell is this guy?), but it was also a sign of great things to come from Edward Norton. He is one of our greatest actors. The plot, an altar boy is accused of murdering a priest who as it turns out was molesting him, seems even more relevant 10 years later than it did in 1996. That is the basic plot, but there are so many subplots and side stories about political corruption and cover ups that make for one incredibly satisfying story. The performances are top notch all the way down the cast. Richard Gere, Laura Linney, John Mahoney, Steven Bauer and even Terry O' Quinn turn in stellar performances. The movie takes place in Chicago and I believe it perfectly captures what I consider to be the Chicago mood or attitude (I live in a western suburb of Chicago). Of course the movie is about more than an altar boy who may or may not have committed murder and political corruption. The movie's central character, Martin Vail (Gere), is a defense attorney who because of his high profile cases enjoys a minor celebrity status. His name is always in the newspapers and his face is always on the TV news. He can't get enough of this attention either. Martin is a great defense attorney, but he's definitely too arrogant for his own good. When a reporter asks, ""When do you realize you have them? When do you realize you've won?"" Vail responds without giving it much thought, ""The minute I accept the case."" I saw this movie for the first time when it was released in the theaters. A lot of movies promise a ""truly shocking ending"" and that ""THIS movie will keep you guessing until the very end."" The trailers for Primal Fear said none of that. Sitting in the theater there was no expectation on my part for a twist ending. Perhaps that is why during its initial viewing it was more shocking to me than even the twist in The Sixth Sense. With The Sixth Sense you KNEW there was something to figure so for two hours that is exactly what you did. You tried to figure it out. Primal Fear's ending totally sucker punched me. The twist isn't revealed until the final minute or two of the movie, so up until the minute it is revealed the viewer honestly trusts everything they have just seen. There are no hints that what you are being told may not be true. It's a masterpiece. Hitchcock would have loved it and it's Edward Norton's performance that really makes it work.",10.0,Bandit1974,2006/08/12,22,20

Now that Peter had ""lost"" his spider powers he thought things would run smoothly for him and his life style. But all of that changed when his girl-friend was kidnapped by the guy he used to look up to Doctor Octavius better known as Doc Ock by the newspaper Peter worked at. I was a bit scared of the new villain in town who was after Spider-man and his machine that fused together the tentacles on his back spine and messed with his mind to the point that he nearly killed Peter who revealed himself to Doc Ock when he sacrificed himself to save everyone in the city including Peter and Mary Jane but had unfortunately died of drowning to death.

181,Blackfish,Heartbreaking yet necessary,"Having spent the majority of my Summer holidays as a small child bouncing from theme parks to zoos all over America and the UK, I never really thought about animals in captivity being cruel until I was older. I already had a solid opinion on this subject before I watched Blackfish so my world view didn't really shift, it was merely justified. I can guarantee though that if you have a positive opinion on wildlife in captivity (specifically large mammals like Orca's) or never really thought about it, this documentary will open your eyes. Blackfish really hits hard early on showing exactly what Seaworld, and other large corporations with animals, have done in the past to gain their animals. Blackfish is full of heartbreak and I think a large part of the efficiency of this documentary is the expert editing and decisions taken by production of where to place the clips and when. The interviews were fantastic and having a slightly contradictory interviewee made the documentary even better. I highly recommend this to everyone although be aware that this is definitely a 15 and it includes some shocking video clips of trainers getting hurt, animals bleeding and high tension.",10.0,daxpea,2013/08/09,22,18
182,Detachment,Should have been named Attachment!,"Such a strong storytelling, such real performances. Adrien Brody is brilliant, way better than any words can describe. If he wins an Oscar for The Pianist, what higher prize would you give him for his performance for Detachment? There is no single instant of time during the movie that you feel he is acting. He loses himself entirely in his character. The opening lines are from Albert Camus' The Stranger: ""And never have I felt so deeply at one and the same time so detached from myself and so present in the world"". I cannot think of any better expression to portray this marvellous movie of Tony Kaye. It is not just about high schools, students and teachers, it is about unbearable vulnerability of being human at any age, facing our problems, not knowing how to handle them, holding our guards high, building walls around us to try to protect ourselves and finally surrendering hopelessly or hopefully. You will see those different choices people are making. This movie perfectly answers the question in Ray LaMontagne's soulful soundtrack song Empty: ""Will I always feel this way? So empty, so estranged?"" Watch it to get your answer... Life is so chaotic, not always in a bad way. It may bring happiness too, unexpectedly.

It's tough to hear from people who have worked at Sea World or some affiliate organization. It's also very revealing that there is no comment from the guys ""responsible"" for it all. And while the movie starts off easy, you can feel something looming over it the whole time. I can't imagine someone actually wanting to go to one of the parks, after watching this movie.

Ferris Bueller, played by Matthew Broderick, is a cool guy, who many people wish they could be. He is friends with everyone and it seems as though nobody dislikes him at all, except for maybe his sister at times.

This movie shows the adventure that Ferris, his best friend Cameron Frye, Alan Ruck, and his girlfriend Sloane Peterson, Mia Sara, have in Chicage driving a classic Ferrari while attempting not be caught by their parents or Principal Ed Rooney, Jeffrey Jones.

This is done by playing songs from the late Fifties. In the second hour, an instrumental score takes over. The music now fits the mood of the film perfectly. I did not only enjoy the music, I also quite enjoyed the cast. Jake Gyllenhaal as Homer Hickam was especially a surprise for me. He gave off a first-class performance, as did Chris Owen (Quentin) and Chris Cooper (John Hickam).

188,The Fault in Our Stars,"Will Hold Your Interest Even If You Don't Get Into The ""Sad Stuff""","When I sat down to watch ""The Fault In Our Stars"", I was worried that it would be nothing but a ""kleenex box flick"". Much like guys can be drawn to the theater with the right quota of explosions, special effects, and superheroes, the same can often be said for women only with really sad stories. That is kind of how this movie is marketed too...as a real tear-jerker. Luckily, the film does enough besides the ""waterworks"" moments to keep your interest throughout. It isn't just all sadness and crying. For a basic plot summary, this movie focuses on Hazel (Shailene Woodley), a teenager living with a rare form of cancer that makes her (in her own words) a ""ticking time bomb"". At a cancer support group (that Hazel usually loathes, of course), she meets Gus (Ansel Elgort), a fellow youngster who also happens to have a less-severe form of cancer. The two strike up a conversation, which leads to a friendship, which leads to a romance. Through a mutual interest in a mysterious author (played by Willem Dafoe), Hazel, her parents (played by Laura Dern & Sam Trammell), and Gus go off on a ""last wish"" adventure to find this author and have him explain the ending of his most famous book. I won't go into any spoilers on what makes this movie so ""sad"", but when you consider it is about two kids with cancer, you can probably put two and two together. If you are into emotional speeches and heart-stirring (for better or worse) scenarios, then you will indeed need a tissue box handy. However, even a 28-year old male like me was able to sit through the film without rolling my eyes or tuning out. Though coated with adolescent angst and high-profile teen actors, the kernel of emotion transferred from the core of the story (although I have not read the book, so I can't get into the differences) to the big screen remains poignant. ""The Fault In Out Stars"" probably gets a bit of a ""bum rap"" right now because the general market is so saturated with these types of stories. I kind of compare it to ""The Giver"" in that regard. Yet, one must remember that is was John Green's book that practically STARTED this entire genre; it just took awhile for it to get transferred to Hollywood. On my personal ranking scale this movie would get a 3.5-star ranking, but I'll bump it up to four stars here because it is a touching story with even a little comedy and light-heartedness thrown into the mix. While the core of the story may be very emotional, it isn't all ""doom and gloom"".",6.0,zkonedog,2017/02/28,2,2

And, on top of that, the script and acting are exceptional. And, most importantly, the film is wildly original and very, very stylish. The only reservations I have are minor. First, while this is a very, very good film, I can't see why it is ranked #5 all-time on IMDb. This seems wildly overrated and too often more recent films seem to dominated IMDb's Top 250. Second, this film is certainly NOT for everyone, as in spots it is tremendously violent (like any Tarantino film) and should not be viewed by kids or the overly sensitive. Because there are so many reviews for the film already, I won't bother to try to give a synopsis of the film or do an in-depth analysis.",10.0,MartinHafer,2010/03/13,21,12
190,Ferris Bueller's Day Off,"I didn't like it, and one for reason alone","I quite enjoy the long and successful run of films that John Hughes had back in the 1980s; PLANES, TRAINS & AUTOMOBILES has long been one of my very favourite comedies. I'd seen bits and pieces of FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF in the past, but never once had I sat down and watched it all the way through - until now. To say that I was disappointed is an understatement. I should like BUELLER because it has an easy-going charm and plenty of incident packed into the running time, but I ended up hating it, and for one reason alone: Bueller himself. He's the most idiotic, sarcastic, and sheer unlikeable protagonist I've seen in a film in a good long time, and never once could I warm to his supposed humour or character. He's a prime example of hubris, thinking himself better than his friends, his classmates, his parents, and his teachers, and I despised him for it. Even worse, Hughes seems to celebrate this cockiness in the character, never once cutting him down to size. This film is the reason I don't like Matthew Broderick as an actor (well, this and GODZILLA), even though he'd previously been good in WAR GAMES. The film itself adopts a journey narrative and offers a handful of memorable set-pieces, including Charlie Sheen's cameo, the elaborate bedroom set-up, and a great public sing-along to the Beatles song. And, although I'm no fan of the actor, Jeffrey Jones has a great role as the antagonist of the piece.

A surreal and deeply fascinating take on life of Henry Hill who was involved in the Mob for three decades and his rise throughout the time span (and Nicholas Pileggi's book ""Wiseguy""). There isn't a single moment in the movie where it doesn't miss a beat, you could only tell by the atmosphere of the time period and it seems so real. The performances in this film simply make it even more memorable and how the characters are portrayed here especially by Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci (who won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor), and Paul Sorvino are believable and easy to understand that they were a family, very close and tightly knit to the core. Also, how director Martin Scorsese lets the movie pace itself and keeps the viewer off guard in what happens deserves a lot of credit.",10.0,mhasheider,2004/11/06,474,330
192,The Chorus,"An Allegory of Passion, Compassion and Joy","Several people observed the plot to be simplistic, the characters to be mostly black-and-white stereotypes, consistency and credibility to be incomplete. Let's give an example: Even though passion and compassion are indeed key points of pedagogy, it is hardly credible that Mathieu might be so overwhelmingly successful while lying all the time. Even though he keeps lying just to protect the children, real children would continue lying at him as well. If you judge the film as a psychological drama, you will indeed find fault. Except Pierre Morhange, hardly any one of the characters experiences any development, and even the change in Pierre's character is neither painted in any detail nor particularly convincing. A drama would require unity of its plot; yet, the film contains several plots only loosely tied to each other: the injury of the caretaker and its consequences, Mathieu's struggle against the director, Mathieu's efforts to help Pierre find himself. No, this is not great drama. All the same, very many people were deeply moved by the film - how can that be? The film is allegorical, and allegory appeals directly to the heart. Mathieu represents Passion (incidentally, for music), Compassion and Tenderness (towards his boys). The effect of passion and compassion is Joy, represented by Pierre near the end of the film. The director represents the opposites: in place of Passion, Rage; in place of Compassion, Callousness; in place of Tenderness, Violence; the consequence is Torment, shown in Mondain. Pierre demonstrates that joy (shown when he first ventures to sing) leads back to passion (when he starts to strive for perfection) and ultimately to compassion (when he becomes thankful towards Mathieu). On the other hand, torment leads back to rage and violence (when Mondain physically attacks the director and sets fire to the school). And what does Pépinot represent? He doesn't have anything, he hardly knows anything, he does not do anything, but he is always waiting at the gate. That is Hope, and of course it is fulfilled in the end. Allegory does not need development, it is static in essence. Allegory does not need logical consistency for its power, but it depends on simplicity and beauty - and of those two, lots may be found in the film. It is not by coincidence that the whole film is placed in a universe by itself nearly disconnected from all the world we know - or the one our parents knew in 1949. This is indeed how allegory works best: any references to the complications of real life would just distract from the essence to be represented. Thus, for example, the boys sing classical music only - even though real boys of that age would have asked for contemporary music quite soon. Having seen this film, you would not guess that radio and television became mass media long before 1949. Now you probably wonder why i rated the film so low - even though i recognize it as a touching work of art in the field of allegory. Well, allegory was well suited to the state of human mind of the Middle Ages, and its last height came about during the age of Romanticism. In our time, allegory is no more sufficient to describe social or even moral affairs. Besides, the picture is not even flawless as an allegory. For example, i fail to understand why Pierre's mother is mentioned in the plot at all. She has no allegorical meaning, she pollutes the allegory by references to contemporary social reality (a single mother forced to work as a waitress), and - horrors in the context of allegory! - a story is told about her, a plain every-day love story. Perhaps the film-maker feared the general public would deem a film lacking any kind of romance just too boring. Besides, the film sometimes slightly drifts away from allegory towards psychological drama (without convincing in that field, as stated above). The director, as the allegorical figure of Callousness, ought not to enjoy the construction of paper planes, in fact he ought not to enjoy anything; as the allegory of Order and Authority, he ought not to act spontaneously, in particular not to join the boys in the football area after being shot with the football. In reality, even the worst villain may suddenly show passion or joy - but not in allegory.",4.0,ingo_schwarze,2006/07/29,16,4
193,Pulp Fiction,The most rewatchable movie of all time,"Possibly the most influential movie made in history since the first movie ever made .Even after 25 years and a countless number of copy cats this movie absolutely holds up and feels fresh. As many of you would know this movie is sort of like a tribute to the pulp stories written back in the 40s and 50s which have punchy and witty dialogue and over the top violence. The random chit chat between characters regarding obscure things might feel a waste of time as it doesn't move the plot. But Tarantino is a genius and he believes in character development more than plot development so these chats actually humanizes the characters a lot and makes them relatable and memorable(The absolute converse of Nolan). This movie is just a collection of wonderful scenes back to back from start to finish.. The movie is a must watch just for the awesome screenplay alone. To top it off all the actors arguably give their career best performance(think about it ,it is true) . And the ability of Tarantino to just create a really tense or ridiculous situation out of nowhere(like the psycho tribute scene with marsellus and butch which is so unexpected or that adrenaline shot scene) is just awesome and keeps you on the edge of your seats . So if you want an entertaining but clever movie this is the one you are looking for . It is funny, filled with some of the best dialogues ever ,superbly acted, great soundtracks(I just wanna see Tarantino's ipod , boy does he have great taste) and is just a spectacular experience. Spoilers ahead(duh): For those of you who say the characters are hollow I suggest you to revisit the gold watch sequence. Walken's Capt Koons tells a story to young butch about how Butch's grandpa requested an enemy soldier to return his watch to his family and the soldier agreed. Similarly Butch could have left Marsellus but the legacy of his watch made him save him which I believe was a nice touch. And how Jules(one of my characters of all time) undergoes a change is also a noteworthy counter argument to the above mentioned criticism. Sorry for the huge review..",10.0,gautammayya,2020/04/10,44,40

195,The Green Mile,"An excellent, unusual, disturbing and thought-provoking film","Without prior knowledge this long, long film threatened me with a late, late night. I started it with prejudice and with reluctance. Prejudice perhaps because the mere idea of death row is horrifying in itself, and to make a movie that is set right in and on death row sounds unappealing - and it is exactly that at first sight. But the quiet dignity of the boss warder (Tom Hanks) is convincing and compelling. In juxtaposition to the 'quiet man' was the wimpy, nasty little thorn in his side - Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchison) playing another prison guard. But as a vicious, sadistic little bastard who wants to inflict his own punishment on others because of his warped view of life and his own insecurities. Well enough played for one to develop a keen dislike for him within minutes of clapping eyes on him. Set in a time not long after Fred Astair and Ginger Rodgers this film plays out the agony of seeing a huge black man brought onto death row as a convicted murderer of two little blond girls. Even his defending council says the he is guilty and never to be trusted - not even for a moment. Implying that if Hanks is foolish enough to trust him he will regret it. Despite that Hanks takes the risk and pays the price in an unexpected way. This huge black man excellently played by Michael Clarke Duncan cures the ailing Hanks (he has a urinary infection in the days before antibiotics) just by a laying on of hands. Hanks accepts this as a miracle, but he then sees further evidence of this huge, gentle giant's miraculous powers. With a real sense of claustrophobia the scene of the nasty guard, Percy Wetmore being punished by his fellow guards is not for the squeamish. It will worry me for a time to come. The agony comes when the black gentle giant carries out further miraculous acts and yet is still not saved from the electric chair. The ironic 'punishment' Hanks receives for not saving him from his execution turns on its head what most of us would value greatly. It is both a sad, and yet at times a darkly humorous film, but at all events not to be taken for granted nor dismissed easily. For me this was one of the most compelling films I have seen in a long, long time. If you only watch films just to be entertained, don't bother. If you watch films just to be excited, don't bother. If you watch films because you want to be transported to another time and another place and want to experience the moral dilemmas of some good men and to see the actions of some evil men then this will hold your attention from start to finish. You will remember this film as well as you have the Shawshank Redemption.",9.0,patrickeab,2006/02/12,7,4
196,Hotel Transylvania,Good Monsters,"Hotel Transylvania (2012) *** (out of 4) Nice animated film about Dracula growing protective of his new daughter so he creates Hotel Transylvania in hopes that she will always stay there and never enter the ""real world"" with humans. This location would also be the perfect getaway for other monsters but on her 118th birthday, the daughter decides she wants to experience a new type of life and she gets her chance when a teenage boy sneaks into the hotel. It seems like most people went into this movie not expecting much but it really turned out to be pretty good and especially if you're a fan of monster movies. I think kids are really going to enjoy everything going on but there's also a lot of stuff for adults including some terrific winks to previous monster movies like BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN and THE INVISIBLE MAN. What I liked most about this film were all the monsters because there's so much imagination going on inside the hotel. I thought the big guys like Dracula, Frankenstein's monster, the mummy and the various werewolves were all very fun but even the smaller characters were a blast. Just check out the brain that gets stepped on by the teenager. Another plus is that the vocal work is extremely good with Adam Sandler leading the way as Dracula but we also get nice work from Fran Drescher, Kevin James, Selena Gomex, Andy Samberg, Steve Buscemi and David Spade. The animation is top-notch throughout as the entire look of the sets are very good. HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA has a few flaws along the way but for the most part it's entertaining and well worth watching.",,Michael_Elliott,2013/02/02,1,1
197,Pulp Fiction,"It's Wild, It's Chaotic, It's Pulp Fiction!!!","My oh my. ""Pulp Fiction"" is one of those roller-coasters of a movie. It is both a joy and a trial to sit through. Amazingly original and unforgettable, Quentin Tarantino's trash masterpiece never gets old or seem outdated. It put a face on American independent film making in 1994. Miramax had been around since the 1970s and no one had heard of it before this film. Studios went into a panic when this film came out because they knew it would be an amazing hit. Of course it was. Independent film making became the rage and hit its peak in 1996 when four of the five nominated Best Picture films were from independent studios. The screenplay and direction by Tarantino are quite amazing, but the cast makes the film work. John Travolta (Oscar nominated) re-invented his career with this film. Bruce Willis cemented his celebrity. Samuel L. Jackson and Uma Thurman (both Oscar nominees) became marketable superstars. Others who make appearances include: Ving Rhames, Christopher Walken, Eric Stoltz, Rosanna Arquette, Steve Buscemi, Frank Whaley, Harvey Keitel, and of course Quentin Tarantino himself. They all leave lasting impressions as well. Samuel L. Jackson stood out the most to me, his lack of substantial screen time may have cost him the Oscar. Just an amazing accomplishment, all involved deserve recognition. Easily 5 stars out of 5.",,tfrizzell,2000/06/25,511,325
198,Interstellar,Not Just A Class Apart...One of the Best 'Sci-Fi' flicks of all time!,"Bad-ass... is the adjective which I choose to type the first word of this review. As I left the theater I was not only spellbound, but I was also sulking about the fact that the movie had ended. The movie has a slow pace at the beginning, but not really boring. Steady and unique in its nature, I did feel that this movie might end up like last years blockbuster 'Gravity' starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. With every minute that passed, I could feel the importance of time, which let my prejudice drain away. With twists and turns, but not brain-spraining at all, it did make emotions come at par with adventure. Great acting by Matthew McConaughey did overshadow Anne Hathaway. With an epic storyline and Nolan's direction Space, Galaxy and the Universe did reach a whole new level. I would love to rate this movie 10 stars without a second thought because it reached the depth of my heart and left me speechless. This movie is not a movie which is meant to be wasted by watching it at your laptop or TV. It's buck worthy and a must watch for all the people who wait for some new serious, touching, heartwarming, adventurous, Science Fiction and Oscar deserving movies of all time. Hat's off to both the Nolans!",10.0,sohylejain,2014/11/08,177,96

I can tell you I've watched this movie about 3 times and I can't seem to tire of it. There was one scene in the movie that I won't ever forget. It was the suicide scene of the depressed girl who made cupcakes. Everything in that scene was so pitiful, in a good way. The white frosted smiley faces on the cupcakes, the gentle sadness expressed by the girl, and the sympathetic look Brody shot her got me teared up. Anytime I am acting on stage, thinking of this scene in particular helps me with my fake cry, haha. The theme may seem melodramatic. However, the visual symbolism and multiple uses of showing shots through taken pictures sets the mood as real and artful. Great movie for all teachers everywhere, especially those who are just starting off. Cheers!",9.0,briana-nguyenwin,2015/04/12,2,2
200,Death of a Salesman,"Shame on you, Mrs. H.","I had to read Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman` for my English class this year. Our teacher was a very industrious woman and let us analyze every character's every word several times, until we couldn't hear the words Willy`, Linda`, Biff`, American Dream` and stockings` any more. It was terrible! She didn't show us any theater or film version, so we began to utterly dislike the text as a whole: a sentimental play where you already know the ending when you read the title. A few days ago, I spotted Volker Schlöndorff's film version on television, a German dubbed version, but that doesn't matter because I already knew the lines and Schlöndorff hardly changed them. Fortunately, Schlöndorff didn't make any effort to put his own special style into the movie, he just left the play the way it was and the way, I suppose, Arthur Miller wanted it. So some of you might claim that this version was too stage-drama-like, not cinematic. For me, this was ideal because I could see the REAL, lively Death of a Salesman`, played by an ideal cast: Dustin Hoffman: a little over-acting, but enthusisiastic; Kate Reid: so authentic that she could be taken for my mother; John Malkovich: silent, thoughtful, self-confident`, great! How shall I put it? This film sort of opened my eyes towards this great, merciless work of Arthur Miller. This play is something you can orientate your life to. At many important turning points of your life, you can remember Willy Loman and his fate that is fictitious but  and believe me, I know some people who are exactly like him  definitely could be the fate of a real person, and not only of an American. I found the Salesman` important, not as much as a criticism of the American Dream but an account of what must happen, if lives are built upon lies  lies to others and lies to yourself. Those people who think Death of a Salesman` is rubbish are those who suppress cruel truths just as Willy Loman does. So, when I saw this movie, I was completely stunned because its hopelessness became clear to me and I noticed how crucial this American classic really is. I give Schlöndorff 8 out of 10 stars because there are some flaws in his way of directing (e. g. letting Malkovich and Lang play their young alter egos was stupid because no one believes that they are 17). Another sad example how bad teachers can destroy a masterpiece. Shame on you, Mrs. H.!",8.0,Mort-31,2001/08/03,58,48

He comes across a case about a young man denying that he killed his priest despite all the evidence pointing to him. When it transpires that the accused (Aaron played by Edward Norton) has a split personality who claims to be the murderer (Roy, also Norton) it is too late to bring it into court. The film is thrilling right up to the end and the final twist, while expected, did not disappoint. Edward Norton was simply superb as Aaron/Roy. He put in a very powerful performance as Aaron/Roy and did not let down on his first film. He has a greatly versatile acting ability and has shown this in many of his films up to date. On the whole, Primal Fear was an excellent film, with wonderful performances from Richard Gere and especially Edward Norton.",,pdkm_,2002/12/23,2,2

206,Detachment,It starts with a whisper,"""I call him religious who understands the suffering of others."" - Mahatma Gandhi Tony Kaye's ""Detachment"" stars Adrian Brody as substitute teacher Henry Barthes. The product of an abusive home, Barthes remains at a protective distance from other human beings. Rootless, anhedonic and without material or personal attachments, Barthes spends his days bouncing from school to school. Students don't matter. People don't matter. Barthes' journey toward compassion and so connection begins when he meets Erica (Sami Gayle), a damaged prostitute. He takes Erica into his home, cares for her, their relationship offering respite from a world that is otherwise callous and indifferent. How indifferent? Throughout ""Detachment"", Kaye portrays the high-school, the streets, the family and the workplace as vile arenas. Teachers, principles, businessmen, children, adults, students...everyone on display is a cauldron of apathy, guided only by hate, ignorance, profit and self-gratification. How can such a society produce anything but monsters? How can such a society produce anything but burnt-out bodies, misery and sickness? Kaye's solution, of course, is to try a little tenderness; inject a little love and empathy into the mix. It's a tactic which Barthes himself tries. But after hugging a depressed teenager, Barthes quickly becomes a child abuse suspect. It's a cruel irony. We no longer underestimate the power of a touch, smile, listening ear or kind word, but view such things with suspicion at best, signs of weakness at worst. ""Detachment"" is said to be about the ""problems with America's failing school system"", but it's not really. Kaye has no interest in assigning blame to either teachers, parents or students. All may be simultaneously culpable, but for Kaye, these people and institutions are products of something else; something widespread, global and deeply entrenched. ""The powers that be are dumbing us to death!"" Barthes yells, as he rants about the dangers of what he calls a ""marketing Holocaust"". But no one listens. ""Detachment"" boasts a fine performance by Adrian Brody, whose character represents the moral flip-side to his work in Ken Loach's underrated ""Bread and Roses"". The film has been criticised for being heavy-handed, bombastic and over-the-top, criticisms which are all true. ""Detachment's"" last act, which contains a clichéd suicide and much forced ""tragedy"", is itself mostly a mess. But some of this can be excused; shot on a low budget and in a just a handful of days, what Kaye achieves given the limitations imposed upon him is admirable. In a world of vacuous spectacle, a humble film with a point is a thing to celebrate. 7.9/10 – A good film, despite a poor second half. See ""Half Nelson"".",,tieman64,2014/10/24,2,2

It was definitely the male lead that spoilt it for me. I just didn't understand his naked obsession with the female lead. From the minute he sets eyes on her, wham he is in love! I found that very strange, or maybe it was just the way he did it. I know love at first sight happens but this seemed way over the top. If you watch Love Story from the 60's which features cancer, it has an authentic love story and build up but this film does not seem to be that genuine so you don't really care about the characters.

In fact, it's hard to know where to begin when praising the elements of this film - such elements as the dark location shots of a (now gone) seedy Times Square, the cinema verite settings of the cabbies and campaign workers, the magnificent Bernard Hermann score, Paul Schrader's fine script, the memorable performances of Jodie Foster, Harvey Keitel, and Peter Boyle all must be mentioned. However, the brilliance of this film is primarily a result of the brilliance of De Niro and Scorsese, one of the greatest actor-director teams in movie history.

210,The Wailing,Shlock-infested South Korean horror import fails to scare or entertain,"Why do critics often overrate foreign films? Could it be that that there are no frames of reference to effect able comparisons? Such is the case with Na Hong-jin's, The Wailing, a rather dopey ""horror thriller"" set in a rural area of South Korea. If you must see this inane tale, then see it for the nifty cinematography which features plush landscapes of the South Korean countryside. The protagonist here is Jong-goo, a police officer, who dotes on his young daughter, Hyo-jin. One is struck immediately by the crude talk of the local constabulary which Jong-goo belongs, having attained the rank of sergeant. The local police have now been entrusted with investigating a series of deaths due to what initially is believed to be some kind of gruesome infectious disease, leaving bubonic plague-like splotches on the skin, leading to murders committed by sole family members. A mysterious woman informs Jong-goo about an elderly Japanese man, living out in the sticks, who might be a person of interest. A local hunter claims he saw the man almost naked, with glowing red eyes, eating a deer. Jong-goo, along with another officer, perform what appears to be a warrant-less search on the stranger's house while he is away and the partner finds pictures of the infected and murdered victims inside the Japanese man's home (he's so shocked that he doesn't he even tell Jong-goo). No need to go into great detail about what happens next. Suffice it to say that when Hyo-jin becomes infected, Jong- goo attempts to hunt the Japanese man down after putting a posse together including a young Japanese-speaking deacon. They aren't successful in capturing the alleged ""demon,"" and then Jong-goo's mother- in-law recommends employing Il-gwang, a local shaman, who subsequently performs a bizarre ritual designed to remove the spirits inhabiting Hyo- jin's body. Jong-goo finally is forced to play ""will the real demon please stand up,"" and is unable to discern whether the mysterious woman he encountered earlier is being truthful when she denies being the demon and continuing to point the finger at the ""Jap"" (antipathy toward the Japanese still apparently runs high even among modern day South Koreans). The deacon however, ends up confronting the old man who reveals himself to be the actual demon. The ending is decidedly not happy at all when Jong-goo returns home and finds his wife and mother-in-law slaughtered by his now possessed daughter. There is supposed to be some kind of twist when we discover that Il-gwang might be part of the demon club, after we see him returning to his car, unintentionally dropping a box containing photos of the other victims of those possessed. The Wailing disappoints for two major reasons. First there's the protagonist Jong-goo, played by Do-won Kwak. I don't think I've ever seen a police officer as wimpy as the one played by Kwak. The demon appears to wreak havoc upon his psyche and he's end up a blubbering mess —a shell of a man—at film's end. Where was Bruce Willis when you needed him? Second and more important, Na Hong-jin's monster isn't one bit scary or original. All the flesh eating and glowing eyes are things we've seen many times before in these type of films. The only people who end up wailing are those who pay tickets for this paltry and lugubrious entry in the pantheon of shlock (not shock) infested entertainment.",3.0,Turfseer,2017/11/04,14,7
211,Primal Fear,The final twist makes it a worthwhile experience,"Primal Fear is one of the most popular suspense-thriller movies of the 90s. Richard Gere as Martin Vail, an accomplished lawyer takes up a case as a defendant that would give him all the limelight he enjoys being in. Edward Norton as Aaron has delivered one of the most sensational performances of his lifetime, that took him to popularity heights he would've been dreaming of. The movie takes its time in laying down the events and proceeds patiently. Some of the scenes in the court-room were a little off and unconvincing. Meanwhile, Aaron's psyche is under examination by a neurologist in parallel. And when we learn about his split personality disorder, we really begin to feel for the poor boy's mental trauma. The case proceeds with Vail finally unleashing Aaron's alter personality, Roy, on his adversary in the court. Vail goes to meet him in his cell after the case is over. Normal formalities are exchanged and Vail is about to leave. Aaron says something, inadvertently, that causes the lawyer to stop and turn back. And that's when one of the most iconic reveals of modern cinema happens. This final twist is what makes the movie a quality-watch for me",9.0,Abhinav009,2019/09/21,4,4

Many of the movies based on superheroes in a comic book tend not to stick close to the actual story. I personally have been a Spider-Man fan since I was seven. The movie has surpassed my expectation and I certainly look forward Spider-Man 3! The next film sets itself up for a kick butt start. Raimi should take a page from X2 or the Lethal Weapon series and just open the next film with a wild battle. Keep the Tobey thought intro but have him talk over a Spider-Man vs Sandman battle. You can grab the viewer right away and still tell your full story right after. A villain made of sand really doesn't need an intro and these kids clamoring for more action will be satiated enough to let Sam continue to spin his remarkable story and his take on Spider-Man.,10.0,peevedoff2,2005/04/26,18,12
213,Moon,There is so much to admire about this film!,"""Moon"" is an amazingly different film. First, the film is a sci-fi film that is set on the moon. It has exceptionally nice special effects--yet only cost five million dollars to make!! Second, it only stars one guy--Sam Rockwell. Along with the voice of the computer (Kevin Spacey), and BRIEF glimpses at others through memories or over phone calls, this IS the entire cast! Third, and most importantly, the film really kept me guessing throughout and is thoroughly original! The film is the first full-length film of Duncan Jones--the son of David Bowie (Bowie's real name, by the way, is David Jones). While he's only made one film since (""Source Code""), I cannot imagine him not getting many more opportunities because his skills are so evident in ""Moon""--a film he not only directed but he came up with the story as well! This guy is something. The film is set in the near future. To supply the Earth's energy needs, NASA is mining Helium-3 from the Moon. On this moon base is Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell)--a guy who seems to be losing his mind. It's probably because he's been alone for nearly three years. What is obvious is that something is amiss--and he is either hallucinating or there is another version of him on the base as well! Yes, following an accident, he awakens to see another Sam Bell. At this point in the film, I KNEW exactly what was coming next. Well, I was 100% wrong!!! The film really took my by surprise and the dark turn really caught me off guard--and I really, really like that in a movie. However, I don't want to spoil it. See the film yourself and see a wonderful example of a film that is highly original, intelligent and cheaply made! A truly unique film--and one that is available now on Netflix. And, like ""Gravity"", it's a space film with a tiny cast that thoroughly kept my interest. By the way, my only complaint about this film, and it's minor, is that the movie is rated R. You do see Rockwell's butt and I wish that scene was chopped out--not because I am a prude but because a lot of teens won't be able to see the film due to it's rating and some adults might avoid it as well. As a parent, I would certainly let my daughters see the movie--it's really something special.",10.0,MartinHafer,2014/03/07,28,18
214,Goodfellas,After about 40 minutes we turned it off,"Here in Crete Greece there are many films shown during the night on TV so my wife and I use the users comments to decide which films to record to watch at a decent hour. This film being 19th in the top 250 film was a must to record. Without a doubt this is a well made film, with atmospheric photography and very good acting. The violence which we saw although harsh was artistic and thus a bit detached from reality. In fact we found the style of the film rather too artistic and atmospheric and after a 40 minutes we looked at each other and agreed we were bored by it. We could not relate to any or the characters in the film nor did we care what happened to them. So we turned it off and deleted it to make space for another film.",1.0,johnshephard80,2007/03/08,131,45
215,Hotel Transylvania,Nothing Special,"During the first 15-20 minutes or so, I was regretting this film, thinking that it was going to be an unbearably long couple of hours. There is a stretch where it is basically just a rapid fire sequence of cheap, uber-cliché monster/Halloween character jokes. A bunch of characters playing their stereotypes for all they are worth, and nothing more. Fortunately, things do pick up and there actually is a story. That was a relief for me. The last 2/3 of the film is fairly entertaining. Still obnoxious, and certainly not all that original, but entertaining. There is some emotional heart to it, and uh, yeah. The ending, as the plot is wrapped up and before the credits roll, is just over the top ridiculous, so much so that even the most cynical viewer probably cannot resist a smile. The credits themselves are fun, as well. Is Hotel Transylvania a ""good"" film? I have a hard time going that far. Did it really need to be made, i.e. does it add anything of particular value to our cultural experience? Resounding ""No"". But is it really all that bad? No; it is fairly harmless, and like similar films, decent viewing for children, with a good message and lots of fun, bright colors. That is about it.",5.0,brent_or,2012/12/05,15,7
216,Spider-Man 2,Spider-Man returns...Wonderful news!,"In 2002, Sam Raimi proved he was the right man to give cinematic life to Marvel Comics'most popular character.With this sequel, he proves he can do the same thing again, only a lot better... Two years after the events of the first movie, Peter Parker's life hasn't got any better: the woman he loves is engaged to his boss's son, his best friend accuses Spider-Man of said friend's father's murder, and his powers are beginning to fail him(comparisons with Smallville aren't a problem, since the show's creators contributed to the Spider-man 2 script).Plus, there's a new weird guy in town: Dr.Otto Octavius(Alfred Molina), aka Doc Ock.Trouble's on its way... This film is far more exciting and gripping than its predecessor, and it also contains some humor(check out Raimi-regular Bruce Campbell's cameo).The original actors are excellent, while Molina's Ock is more conflicted and charming than Willem Dafoe's superb Green Goblin.The movie also contains the most breathtaking action sequence ever,featuring Spidey, his nemesis and a speeding train. A real triumph within the genre, it makes the expectations for the third movie very high, as people wonder what Raimi can do to overshadow the greatest superhero movie after Batman Begins.

217,Ferris Bueller's Day Off,My Favorite Movie Of All Time!,"I think it is only fitting that I dedicate my first movie review to my favorite movie, Ferris Beuler's Day Off. This movie got me through High School.. and much of my adult life as well. That is, until Office Space came along, but that is another review. Ferris Beuller (Matthew Broderick) was the kid in High School who never got caught, had fun doing whatever it was and was popular with everybody. On this particular day in the movie, Ferris decides he is taking the day off. After all, ""How can anyone be expected to handle school on a day like this?"" Ferris calls his best friend, Cameron Frye (a young Alan Ruck), who is always sick, and tells him to pick him up. After all, Ferris does not have a car. He wants to show Cameron a good time before High School is all over and wants him to have something good to remember about it. Also, Cameron is Ferris's phony caller voice. Whenever Ferris needs a call made, such as from a police officer or another parent, Cameron is the man. Eventually, Ferris and Cameron gets Sloane Peterson (Mia Sara) excused, by using the dead grandmother excuse. Ferris is always one step ahead of his adversary, Principal Ed Rooney (Jeffrey Jones). Rooney is portrayed as a hard ass principal who does not let anything get by him. He sets off to catch Beuller in the act and put a permanent mark in his record and hold him back another year, so as not to have other Ferris Beuller wannabes for years after Ferris's departure. Jones was perfect for his role as Rooney and I do not think that role will ever be surpassed for him. Most of the movie is spent with Rooney looking for Ferris and, as mentioned earlier, is about one or two steps behind him. He comes very close to catching him but never gets the job done. Rooney is the stooge in the movie that every teen and even the adults enjoy seeing him beaten and outsmarted by his young student. I don't think anyone has expected otherwise. All throughout the movie, it pokes fun at the boring and tedious high school classroom. Ferris will say something like, ""If we played by the rules right now, we'd be in gym class"" and then it cuts to an exaggerated look at a gym class, which more resembles a boot camp. Ben Stein will forever be remembered here as the extremely boring economics teacher. There are many more characters to this movie that make it great. There is Grace (Rooney's secretary), Jeanie and the rest of Ferris's family, the parking garage guys, the snooty waiter, Charlie Sheen and others. My friends and I still quote randomly from the movie in our everyday situations. That is how much of an impact this movie has made on many lives. There are so many great parts and quotes from this movie, they are too numerous to list in a review, nor would I want to ruin it for anybody who has not seen it, although I can not fathom why you haven't. If not, it is a must see.",10.0,AbeFroman-3,2005/04/18,189,127
218,The Chorus,A rest house for busy minds,"Two Continental European films with campus setting are on show right now in town: Spanish director Pedro Almodóvar's ""La mala educación"" and French director Christophe Barratier's ""Les choristes"". However, the former deals with the devil which is pretty disturbing while the latter the angels that touches the viewers' heart and soul. It blows in new fresh air into the cinema world. People may associate the film with the 1945 production ""La cage aux rossignols"". Yet, ""Au revoir les enfants"", ""La gloire de mon père"", ""Le château de ma mere"", ""Nuovo cinema Paradiso"" and the literature namely ""Le Petit Chose"" by Alphonse Daudet and the hugely popular series of René Goscinny's ""Le Petit Nicolas"" were rushing into my head when the film rolled on. They all share a number of common features: younger carefree days, reminiscence, scenic countryside, pastoral living etc, they are all ingredients of French fresh (salad) movie, warm, humane and unforgettable. The genre is perpetually popular and it is ever-lasting. Strangely the subject matter though is related to ""To Sir, with Love"", ""Mr. Holland's Opus"", they didn't come up to my mind immediately. French people are capable of producing movies or books with nostalgic ideas, the power again captures the world's heart. A country with long history or brilliant history provides much space for artists, France is one of them. Perhaps the French have no incentive to push forward like the Brits or Americans or they are pessimistic about the future or they lack funds, many the French artists (of various art form) keep looking into history for inspiration. Many French global blockbusters are filmed in nostalgic background setting, ""Amélie"" is the one in the 50s or early 60s. Cruelly truthful is if we compare the development (in most areas) of the developed nations on the west and east Atlantic coasts, the UK and the USA are exactly more advanced. Pierre, Pépinot, Le Querrec, spectacled Boniface and all the other children form not only a choir but an angelic choir. The boys' angelic voices has resounded inside my head for pretty long time. The angels rekindle Clément Mathieu's abandoned hope on music and hope again falls onto these young souls. On top of it, he is the unsung hero on the making of the world famous conductor Pierre Morhange. Mondain, apparently sexually harassed, is not a incurable boy but a boy in his quest for love. Mathieu wants to carry out his ""experiment"" on him. And the young boy knows the class tutor is a kind and reasonable teacher. His smile to Mathieu before he is pulled away by the police tells it all. Mathieu believes in moral education (or educating children in love) which is entirely different from iron-handed Rachin's hard-line pedagogical conviction and administration. Should time be given, Mondain would find his way out from the excruciating self-destruction. Just a side thought: Hong Kong educators should have more thought on dealing with ""problem students"", from time to time what these young people need is a tender light guiding them onto a path which they can have satisfaction and security. Well, we are somehow regressing now.",,shu-fen,2004/09/19,62,40
219,The Wailing,It will haunt your soul long after you've walked out of the theater,"If ""The Chaser"" and ""The Yellow Sea"" have not solidified Na as one of the best Korean filmmakers of this generation, his third feature has certainly done so. ""The Wailing"" is a cinematic masterpiece in every sense and it will haunt your soul long after you've walked out of the theater. While it pays homage to ""The Exorcist"" in many ways, this is no horror film, and in fact, it is unlike any film I've ever seen. The once familiar clichés turn against you. The cultural and spiritual elements add a distinct Korean flavor. The film is completely absent of jump scares and instead, opts to draw out tension in what feels to be a very short two-and-a-half hour experience. Credit goes to the clever editing as I often found myself mind-blown during scene transitions, and craving more pieces to put together in this complex puzzle of a plot. While there's a lot going on here, it's hard to miss the visceral images that are given such detail, and it helps that every plant has a payoff. The performers have a lot of range, from tacit facial expressions to downright melodramatic wailing. Child actor Kim Hwan-hee stands out even among a veteran ensemble cast that includes Hwang Jung-min and Jun Kunimura. Na is often criticized for stoic machismo, but these characters are dynamic; the protagonists increasingly vulnerable, and the antagonists all the more menacing. When the credits rolled, I could not get up. And when my legs could hold me again, I found myself coming back to the theater. There is a sick appeal to this emotional and physical torment, so enjoy it twice, maybe three times, or even more. Many people were left with questions by the end. After many subsequent viewings, I simply say: you see what you want to see.",,neyoless,2016/05/31,52,21
220,Intermission,The Entertainingly Caustic Side of Irish Eccentricity,"""interMission"" can be seen as either an Irish take on Guy Ritchie's bumbling but violent crime comedies, such as ""Snatch,"" or a gritty, urban take on charming, eccentric Irish communities like in TV's ""BallyKissAngel"" or the movie's ""Waking Ned Devine."" The local pub turns the city into a small town of connected characters, all offshooting from the decision of John (Cillian Murphy with his native brogue and the most irresistibly doleful eyes now onscreen) to test an ""intermission"" from his girlfriend. Debut writer Mark O'Rowe and director John Crowley bring freshness to the genre with several unredeemed characters, particularly the most well-known members of the (to U.S. ears) thick-tongued ensemble, in Colin Farrell's bully boy and Colm Meaney's braggard cop, amidst other random cruelties. The women are caustically feisty and independent as they crack the whip over the fumbling men around them. There's laughter, tears, poignancy, surprise twists, and a heavy layer of entertaining cynicism about jobs, sex, and the media. Nice selection of Irish rock on the soundtrack, from U2 to Farrell's Pogues-like take on ""I Fought the Law"" over the closing credits.",,noralee,2004/04/08,8,1

Spiderman is back with more web slinging fun as he takes on Doc Oct who's once again destroying New York. Once again the cast is superb. Acting is wonderful, the plot is fantastic, and the ending is an actual ending!! As the time passes, the movie only gets better and better.

222,Horrible Bosses 2,One should not be so puritanical on this movie,"True, the plot includes several rude jokes and black humor, but the world is variegated, there are many people who are greedy, clumsy, arrogant, vulgar - and sometimes all these qualities are present in a single person. In general, such persons make you mad, but at times, when seeing them from distance (screen included), their activities can make you even giggle and gloating. So was with Horrible Bosses 2, where good (the 3 ""stooches"") or greater (all supporting performances by famous actors, different from their usual roles) performances brought along multiple smiles and laughs, and ""over-the-spindle"" and restless plans and deeds did not cause blah feelings. In many places, rather witty cinematography was used, and the plot - in spite of some fragility - was rounded up in a twisted and distinct manner. Well, if you like some hare-brained relaxation (sometimes) and are not afraid of ""indecent"" topics and jokes, then you have an okay time with this movie. Performances are at least good, sometimes more, after all.",7.0,BeneCumb,2015/02/20,13,6
223,Ferris Bueller's Day Off,A peek into the privileged life,"A classic case of senoritis. Despite the slacker mentality and overall sense of purposelessness, deep down we all realize that Ferris is only acting this way because he has already been accepted to an Ivy League college somewhere in the fall and will end up a banker, lawyer, or doctor eventually (don't think for one second he will be vexed by the decision just as his decision over which country club to join will be equally non-disconcerting). The saddest part is that young people who have been given so much act so snotty to everyone around them. Yet, we all laugh as if somehow we are in on the joke. Sure we are allowed to peek into this privileged life for 90 minutes, but the huge majority must go back to the grinding reality of real life knowing that money does by friends and happiness as Ferris so artfully proves.",5.0,sugar_daddyo,2006/07/22,60,29
224,Goodfellas,A masterpiece exposing misguided loyalties and greed,"Scorcese & Pileggi's masterpiece on the life of Henry Hill as a Brooklyn NY mob wise-guy. As much as the true events of Henry's life have more than likely been dramatised and glamourised to a certain extent, the essence of this film IMO is that it is still a brilliantly damning portrayal of the characters and lifestyle of mobsters. The sham of the mafiosi is exposed - preaching loyalty, respect & principles - but when it comes down to it they are just two-bit criminals that'll stab each other in the back for money or power over others. Each of them has an inflated sense of self-worth and stature that comes with being a ""wiseguy"", breeding with it paranoia that others are not giving them the respect they deserve. An example is De Niro's portrayal of Jimmy Conway. His outward persona is that of a calm and reasonable nature. But really he is a paranoid killer who at the drop of a hat would kill even his closest associates for money. I use associates rather than friends, as their relationships are of tolerance rather than kinship. Distrust, hate and jealousy through the forced smiles. Interesting that given this, certain people envy their life-style and would have loved to have been a wiseguy. I personally couldn't think of anything worse that being tied for life with having to keep the likes of Tommy company, but whatever rocks your boat. Some people have actually paid to see The Dukes of Hazzard film, so I shouldn't be surprised.",10.0,SmilingRon,2005/09/05,301,195
225,Crash,"Do the Right Thing, this ain't","This movie has a good message: Don't be racist. But stop with the fawning already. This movie is worse than awful. It's awful disguised as deep and meaningful. There is ZERO character development. Every character is either a racist or victimized by a racist. Or both. See how racist everybody is. That's bad, right? The same point could have been made by developing just one of these story lines into something intelligent. But, no, we need umpteen story lines involving separate incidents of Rodney-King-level racial injustice, happening over no more than a few days, among a small handful of characters. And if that's not ridiculous enough, these characters cross paths all the while. I know, I know -it's a movie. Okay, then, In the Heat of the Night, A Soldier's Story, Driving Miss Daisy, American History X, To Kill a Mockingbird, Bamboozled, Jungle Fever, Do the Right Thing, and the episode of Star Trek with the half-black/half-white faces are all infinitely better efforts delivering the same message without clubbing you in the head and force feeding you morality.

226,Intermission,Hilarious and poignant - the best Irish film of recent years.,"From the very first scene, where Lehiff (Colin Farrell) chats up a female employee at a coffee shop, I knew this was a film I would enjoy. Various plots and subplots centred on several wickedly funny characters intertwine to create a hilarious and at times poignant work. The main plots are based on the various characters loss of, and search for love which while developed with side-splitting effect, strike a real emotional chord and are at times genuinely touching (watch out for Sally's breakdown after she appears on TV!). The script is devilishly clever and delivered hilariously by first class performances from Cillian Murphy, Shirley Henderson, Deirdre O'Kane and in particular, the brilliant Colm Meaney as the hard lined, uncompromising and ultimately pathetic Garda detective Jerry Lynch. On occasion, `Intermission' can be found guilty of looking for the cheap laugh-at-the-Irish gag so typical of Irish films such as the Barrytown trilogy, but for the most part succeeds in creating genuine laugh-out-loud moments. In addition, Dublin has never looked as unrecognisable, which is a real breath of fresh air. Director John Crowley and writer Mark O'Rowe have done an exquisite job in creating what is arguably the best Irish film of recent years.",10.0,skidmarkz007,2003/09/02,5,0
227,Hotel Transylvania,Proof not every animated movie has to strive to be Pixar,"The Hotel Transylvania movies are some of the most fun cartoony animated movies. The animation is very reminicent of cartoon shows like Tom & Jerry, or Looney Tunes. Characters are animated in exaggerated ways and makes the movies really entertaining to watch. I love most Pixar movies, but they never really deal with cartoony action. This movie does it really well and has a pretty weird sense of humor. This sense of humor makes it extremely watchable by adults. It has a few of the ""jokes kids won't get because they're not old enough"", but it doesn't rely on them. It just has really a creative sense of humor that is clever. Sandler is surprisingly amazing in this as I forget it's him doing Dracula. His usual movie pack also does well and really shows you they do have comedy talent when not stuck in Sandler's awful live action movies. What really makes this work besides the sense of humor is the story. It has heart and really keeps you invested in the movie. The characters are really well done and the family aspect of Drac and Mavis gives this movie so much depth. I'm glad there is a creative team making animated movies like this. It's not the same level as Pixar, but it's really funny and creative in it's own way. It's miles above any of the Despicable Me movies and non-Dragon/Panda Dreamworks movies. It's sad that the series plot wise has kind of gone downhill, but it's sense of humor has still stuck strong and make each movie worth a watch just for that and the cartoony animation.",8.0,Lost_In_Translation_,2019/11/02,1,1
228,Horrible Bosses 2,"Horrible, Terrible, Think of a bigger word!","We were trying to see the movie ""Interstellar"" only to find it was sold out so our options were to either go home or see the movie ""Horrible Bosses 2"", we opted for seeing this movie.

Have you ever been in the family room with your beloved dog has suddenly and without warning you hear that unmistakable pfffffffffffffffffft sound? Yes, that means clear the room because this is a real stinker. Horrible Bosses 2 goes beyond that. The writing was embarrassing at best.

229,Interstellar,"An Emotional, Beautiful Journey into the Unknown","(This is both a review of the film, and an assertion of Christopher Nolan's filmmaking style) There have been many reviewers and critics alike that have high praise for the film (the visual effects, the acting, the music), but say how it's not Christopher Nolan's best directed film. This is where i personally would have to disagree. Before i get into it, though, i'll talk about Interstellar a bit. Interstellar is truly a sci-fi epic like no other. To compare said film to '2001: A Space Odyssey' isn't just a disservice, but unnecessary. The films are almost nothing alike, simply sharing small plot elements. Also, Stanley Kubrick's vision of Arthur C. Clarke's sci-fi epic wasn't to ponder the philosophical questions that accompanied the story, but to make art, and art is was, and is. With Interstellar, Mr. Nolan set out to make his most personal and emotional film to date about love and time (time being a recurring theme throughout all of Nolan's films). But it's so much more than that too. There are no words to express the epic journey Nolan takes us on in the film, but needless to say, it's tear-jerking and emotional throughout. The acting is top-notch, especially McConaughey, who gives (I would say) his most emotional performance yet. But the actor who stole the show in a few scenes (one in particular, when they're on an alien planet) was David Gyasi as Romilly, one of the astronauts aboard the Endurance, their spacecraft. The musical score from Hans Zimmer is, without a doubt, his best and most influential work to date, helping drive the film's bold and breath-taking vision (the church organ helped significantly). The visual effects are easily the best to date as well, and of the year. To see a black hole created through visual effects in such a way, with pages theoretical equations provided by Kip Thorne (theoretical physicist, of whom's work inspired the film's genesis); what you see in the film is the most realistic depiction of a black hole, and even offered new insight to accretion discs surrounding the anomalies. But even everything else, from the alien planets to the Endurance, the visuals always look real. Then, there's the writing. I would definitely have to say this has some of the best dialogue i've ever heard in a sci-fi movie, and the script continually pours or oozes emotion, keeping the audience tethered to the film. Now, about Mr. Nolan. Don't just look at Nolan, but look at his films. Some say Inception would be his masterpiece, while others would say it's The Dark Knight, or Memento. But honestly, every single film Christopher Nolan has directed is a masterpiece not of its genre, but of Nolan. Following is his quiet masterpiece, not the film that put Mr. Nolan on the map as a phenomenal director, but one people visited or revisited after becoming accustomed to Nolan, after seeing Memento, what could be called his breakout masterpiece. Then, right after, he directed the remake of the Norwegian thriller, Insomnia. This, too, could be considered a masterpiece, even if a remake. Then, we were given his take on the Batman universe, starting with Batman Begins, the origin masterpiece. Then, there's The Prestige, adapted from the novel of the same name, which can be called his dark masterpiece. The Dark Knight, his bold masterpiece; Inception, his complex masterpiece, and The Dark Knight Rises, his flawed masterpiece. Now, we have Interstellar, his emotional or personal masterpiece. This is just my looking at Nolan and his films, but whatever your thoughts are, you can't deny Interstellar is one hell of a journey. He certainly is one of the best filmmakers of our time, and of all time. I can't wait to see what he does next, but i'm not sure it will be as emotionally powerful as Interstellar.",9.0,slayerjmk95,2014/11/03,2348,1587
230,Crash,not much here is really of any use to anyone.,"I heard so many great things about Crash. It was one of the best reviewed of the year. actually, I hadn't heard anything bad about it at all. Everyone I talked to loved it. This turned out to be a big mistake on ""everyone's"" part. (I hadn't dug deep enough yet to realize that were plenty of people out there besides ""everyone"" who didn't like it. but that's besides the point of my introduction.) I think the main problem I had with Crash was that it just wasn't believable, at all. A serious dramatic movie isn't worth crap if it isn't believable. If people really acted like they do in this film, LA would be in a state of war. I know there was the whole Rodney King thing in LA, but that got a LOT of attention. The events in Crash depict racism on a scale ridiculously close to that of the Rodney King incident. I'm never convinced at any point in the film that the events depicted really could happen. In fact, I was just in Los Angeles, and people of various ethnicities seemed to get along with each other just fine. sure, there's racism out there, but Crash is about as accurate on racism as Rambo is on war. All the dialogue is pretty horrible, too. Totally unconvincing. I couldn't imagine a single character being an actual person in real life. Crash had too many of those oh-so-dramatic scenes where every line is something flowery and deep, and if you actually heard some one say it in real life you would laugh your head off. (Examples- the scene with the gun with blanks, and with Don Cheadle and his mom.) Some scenes were actually moving, like the car wreck, as hard to believe as it was. but these scenes were overshadowed by all the bad scenes. In the first half of the movie, almost every character was portrayed as a stereotype. I think this was done on purpose... I don't know if the point of that was for them to overcome the stereotypes. Even if they do overcome them, you have an ugly, offensive, and extremely weak first half of the movie. I didn't like the pretentious and over-used idea of having all the stories interweave. It's been done a lot, but it's never been done this bad. In other movies, the fact that there are coincidences is used to make a point of some sort, but not in Crash. I think this is the main weakness of Crash. they went to all this trouble to put a bunch of chance meetings into this film, and what did it mean that these insane coincidences happened? Nothing. The end. There's a lot to like under the surface of Crash... sure, lots of characters overcoming their inner demons, and fun stuff like that. but almost nothing on the surface to like. And actually, I didn't really feel as if Crash had anything to say. (One of the impressions I had gotten from other people before I had seen it was that it had a lot to say.) What was the point? Did it really show us anything we don't already know? Was it trying to show us how harmful racism is? Wow, racism is harmful... Who knew. This film certainly didn't change any of my views. Honestly, I can't believe it has ""changed people's lives""- give me a break. In order for it to change your life, I think you would have to knowingly be a racist before you saw it, and seeing it made you change your ways. Despite all of these problems I had with Crash, I did find some good qualities in it. The music was good. I like Mark Isham. I had high hopes when the movie first started, because the credits had me mesmerized. The music really enhanced certain scenes of the film, too. And, I'll admit that a couple of scenes were moving, although perhaps not genuinely. There was even some pretty strong acting. Ludicrous and Don Cheadle were brilliant. Unfortunately, Crash was still a huge pile of crap. (hah, that's fun to say.) I'd find any John Woo movie to be more believable.",3.0,Henry J Sosenite,2007/06/02,30,19
231,Blackfish,A fish out of water: Black is not always beautiful.,"""A whale has eaten one of the trainers."" Dispatch Recording The notorious killer whale, Tilikum, has killed 3 trainers but remains alive and incarcerated in Sea World as an object of fan fascination. The absorbing and grim doc Blackfish pretty much deflates any lingering romanticism as it presents a credible case for freeing orcas forever from the confinement of aquariums, which may cause the fish to be psychotic. Case in point: Tilikum. Blackfish doesn't easily walk the thin line between entertainment owners making money on orcas and activists dedicated to eradicating cruelty to animals. Director/writer Gabriela Cowperthwaite keeps a consistently humane point of view with talking heads, mostly former SeaWorld trainers, clearly upset with the methods they once sanctioned and the growing awareness of the lethal danger of playing with the black beauties. Although he filmmakers unsuccessfully tried to contact SeaWorld for comment, the doc seems a bit empty without their corporate spin. Yet they do have in their corner orca expert David Duffus, who strongly claims the killers are non-lethal with ""spiritual powers."" The doc's raw footage contradicts any benign consistency in the orcas. The most Duffus can say that is true is to defend the SeaWorlds of the world as harboring ""natural"" killers. The history of capture-to-performance is a stunning case of fish out of water. Herding the lovely behemoths decades ago was a monstrous hunt. Killer whales are frustrated about their confinement and may eventually take it out on trainers, who, until a recent court ruling, embraced and rode the whales without apparently honoring the danger of a wild animal weighing over 6000 lbs. This grim and mesmerizing doc effectively warns all of us about the ""crime"" of corralling wild animals. After deaths and numerous close calls, orca trainers must now work behind fences. SeaWorld is appealing the decision.",,jdesando,2013/08/18,8,6
232,Pulp Fiction,Unbelievable.,"Pulp Fiction may be the single best film ever made, and quite appropriately it is by one of the most creative directors of all time, Quentin Tarantino. This movie is amazing from the beginning definition of pulp to the end credits and boasts one of the best casts ever assembled with the likes of Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth and Christopher Walken. The dialog is surprisingly humorous for this type of film, and I think that's what has made it so successful. Wrongfully denied the many Oscars it was nominated for, Pulp Fiction is by far the best film of the 90s and no Tarantino film has surpassed the quality of this movie (although Kill Bill came close). As far as I'm concerned this is the top film of all-time and definitely deserves a watch if you haven't seen it.",10.0,discoelephant64,2005/01/19,1256,777

234,Crash,A Rusty Sledgehammer.,"Alas, here is a film mired by its excesses; one that comes so curiously close to moments of cinematic brilliance that all but embody the captivating possibilities of film-making, before disappointingly devolving backwards into a predictable, hammy and unbelievable preaching session. Predictable because it follows standards  and doesn't dare to take enough risks. Hammy because it is stiff, simple and suspiciously empty. Unbelievable because a woman is saved from an exploding car on a jam-packed LA freeway and booked into a hospital and the cop who saved her goes back to work minutes afterward and, apparently, her husband is never even notified of her accident (and, if he had been, wouldn't he have been concerned with her welfare and perhaps at least left work early to attend to her?). Later that day he is involved in a high-speed chase; the conclusion of this incident wants to impress us with its irony and depth, but the problem is that there is none. Irony is not irony when it is commanded to be so; these characters do not realistically bounce off each other as they do in Akira Kurosawa's ""Rashomon"" or Quentin Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction""  Paul Haggis' screenplay is contrived, and every time their paths cross, it isn't so much because they could cross (as in ""Pulp Fiction"")  it is because they must cross ways to service the furthering of the plot. It was irony in ""Fiction"" that the watch given to Butch was his father's saving grace and alternatively the cause of his own near-death. When the cop who sexually probed the woman ends up being her savior in ""Crash,"" it isn't irony. It's a gimmick. The film wants to challenge us, spiritually, intellectually, and emotionally  it wants to be on the edge  and it even thinks it is challenging  but in all actuality, it's very light, and the Academy's choice of awarding it Best Picture substantiates this. ""Crash"" plays it safe, too often and frustratingly so. It wants to force us into second-guessing our mentality  but this only makes it feel heavy-handed and manipulative. It proposes that people today (especially in areas such as Los Angeles) are racist  and extends this theory by proving their apparent racism through actions and dialogue  but this only works as a tool for awareness, not resolution. It worked with ""Uncle Tom's Cabin""  it opened doors for new racial policies  but that was at a time when people's eyes needed to be open. It is now the twenty-first century, and bigots and racists know who they are and embrace this fact. We don't need a warning, anymore  we need a solution, and ""Crash"" provides no solid answers. But it does have its moments  few and far between  that are stunning. (The rescue sequence, for example.) Matt Dillon gives a stellar performance, rich with depth and brimming with angst and hatred. Don Cheadle, in a similarly small role (from a cast of seemingly dozens), manages to convey exactly what the film needs in the form of a very human (and therefore very flawed) man from a shaky background who is struggling to maintain his image whilst dealing with a turbulent family situation  all of which comes to a breathtaking finale that doubles back on itself to the very beginning of the film. Yet, for a movie with the gall to proclaim it is firmly rooted in humanity and wants to expose our inherent flaws, and wants to tell us we ""don't know"" who we really are, it does little to connect with its audience  even on the most basic level. The movie is simply too silly to take seriously. There are the aforementioned moments that actually start to amount to something, and begin to captivate  but are unfortunately dragged to a halting stop whenever Haggis tries to nail the point with a sledgehammer. An example of this: Everyone is constantly referring to racism in the script; one character is a conspiracy nut that thinks windows are put on buses to showcase the blacks ""too poor"" to afford anything other than public transportation. One character to the next is having an argument dealing with racial issues  a black car thief claiming all whites are racist; a white woman ranting about blacks and Latinos; a light-skinned black woman calling her husband racial epithets; it's just one after the next, over and over; Haggis didn't need to do this. We didn't need to have the woman's feelings explained to us, explicitly, after she is unjustly probed by the bigoted police officer. Her face says it all  it elicits fear, pain, hatred, and ultimately, deep upset over her husband's fragility and lack of manhood; the actions (or lack thereof) fulfilled by a man so utterly crippled by a fear of his own ethnicity that he denies himself the most basic human rights; peer respect at the cost of humility and debasement. A better director would have stopped here. The face says it all. We don't need the rusty sledgehammer to drive the point in. Sometimes, all we need is the nail, and we can carry out the rest on our own. Note: I give this film seven stars out of ten because some of its better moments outweigh the bad. I reserve giving it a higher rating due to the reasons above, but I do want to make it clear that some parts of the film were very good, and it's a real pity that Haggis was so inconsistent with the movie and couldn't have extended the better parts into a perfect whole.",5.0,MovieAddict2016,2006/03/16,340,185

236,Taxi Driver,A movie that remains as relevant as it was in 1976. Maybe even more so.,"On the cloudy, hazy streets of New York City, a single yellow beacon stands out. A lonely, insomniac, mentally unstable cab driver does his job. All while plotting to cleanse the city of ""human trash."" Welcome to a real-life nightmare: Taxi Driver. With an omniscient feeling of loneliness (symbolized by a taxi) present in Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro), our anti-hero protagonist has his one element that anybody who has ever experienced loneliness in their life can relate to. However, anyone who shoots up a brothel and attempts to assassinate a senator is by no means a role model. Travis Bickle (despite his one trait that an audience can relate to) is such an emotionally disturbed person that he sees very irrational actions as perfectly sane, making him a danger to himself and to other people. The phenomenal score by Bernard Herrmann (known for composing scores for Alfred Hitchcock from 1956-1964) reflects everything about Travis. His insanity, loneliness, bigotry, and instability are all represented in a way that hypnotizes the listener in a cocktail of sound. Travis is a man that has nothing to live for in life. His infatuation with Betsy is doomed to go nowhere. He feels the need to lie to his parents (in the form of a letter) to make his life look better than the boring reality. Travis cannot discern rationally what deeds are right or wrong and, quite frankly, I doubt that he cares. The climactic final shootout (which threatened to give this movie a X rating) is an intense scene that has not lost an ounce of power today. As a kid born in the mid-90's, I can only imagine what effect images like a man having his hand blown apart by Travis's Magnum .45 had on 1976 audiences. The scene also drives home the extent of Travis's fragile mental state. Overall, this is a masterwork from Martin Scorsese. Possibly even THE masterwork (GoodFellas and Raging Bull create tough company) of his entire career. A disturbing wonder (more so for me as I am a high- functioning autistic) of the cinema that is telling of our society and of the human psyche. There are few classics in cinema that have withstood the test of time (in terms of multiple decades) in a way in which they have only become more relevant than when they were initially released. ""Taxi Driver"" is certainly one such movie.",10.0,nooneishome747,2013/12/22,18,11
237,Hotel Transylvania,A very un-unique animation which is still surprisingly good in its own way,"When 'Hotel Transylvania' first came out, I had absolutely no intention of seeing it for two reasons: Adam Sandler and vampires. I thought a comedy about Dracula would be boring. This movie isn't that bad but at the same time isn't that funny In this movie, we have Count Dracula who has organized a building called Hotel Transylvania to keep his fellow monsters safe from the evil humans. Now, doesn't that sound familiar? From a Pixar movie? MONSTERS INC! One day, a human accidentally ventures into the monster world...Hmm...Still familiar and meets Dracula's daughter, Mavis voiced by Selena Gomez and falls in love...Still remind me of the Sully and Boo relationship as well as segments of Twilight. I'll start off by saying that voice acting is brilliant. Adam Sandler really was great as Count Dracula, Adam Samberg was great as Johnny and Kevin James was a great Frankenstein. Selena Gomez also did a great job. The story however isn't anything special by any means. Too much of the story is from Monsters Inc but there are parts of Twilight in this movie which I love as a lot of it is indirectly mocking that god-awful series. The characters are funny but by no means any memorable. The dialogue is actually the movie's greatest strength. It really is hilarious in so many ways. There are so many one liners and Johnny's line ""Wow man! Your Dracula impression is way over the top!"" is simply hilarious as is the woman with the annoying voice saying to the monster in the kitchen ""Your voice is annoying"" If it weren't for the dialogue, this movie could so easily be horrible. The visual animations in the movie are stunning with each scene being carefully visualised and is truly a treat for the eye. The film's main problem is its very close resemblance to Monsters Inc which makes the movie nothing unique. However, the mocking of Twilight is handled very well, the animations are superb, the characters and voice acting are done well and is well directed but a bit rushed at certain points during the film. The film could also have been a good ten minutes shorter and we wouldn't have missed anything funny or special. Overall, a good animation movie which isn't unique but funny",6.0,illbebackreviews,2013/02/22,10,6
238,Pulp Fiction,"A tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.","There are many differing schools of thought regarding Quentin Tarantino and his so-called ""style"". There are those who believe that the director who began his career as a humble video store clerk with a voracious appetite for movies of every conceivable style is talented and worth imitating. While Tarantino has made some movies worth discussing for their positive qualities (Reservoir Dogs is, by far, his best effort), this group of movies is rather small, especially considering that he has only directed five movies. There is another school of thought who regards his works as inane, self-indulgent, and bloated. Pulp Fiction, written and directed by Tarantino, and released in 1994, is his most divisive movie simply by virtue of being his most well-known. Upon its release, it was hailed as a warning shot to a complacent Hollywood- the maverick behind the indie hit Reservoir Dogs apparently had something else up his sleeve. Pulp Fiction is ostensibly a crime story featuring the interconnecting lives of several characters. However, upon repeat viewings, the viewer begins to wonder exactly what that something is. Personally, I found this movie ran too long in spots, likely because Tarantino is so ridiculously in love with the sound of his own voice as spoken by different actors that he is afraid to cut one speech or even a single line. Dialogue, though it doesn't necessarily need to serve the story to justify its inclusion, should not be so dense as to drive the viewer out of the experience. When John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson, on the way to retrieving a briefcase for their employer, are talking about European hamburgers and foot massages, the scene plays like a witty outtake- as though the actors so understood the style of the movie that they were in that they felt comfortable riffing with the material. Not so- the rest of the movie is filled with conversations of a similar type, including (but not limited to) body piercing, blueberry pancakes, hamburgers (again), and coffee (this one performed by Quentin Tarantino himself, as though he couldn't wait to get a shot at delivering his own lines). The strangest thing is, while the characters are ""in character"", as Samuel L. Jackson says in an opening scene, the movie is quite enjoyable. When the characters are placed into real confrontations, the movie takes on an entirely different persona and becomes at least a decent crime movie. Ultimately, however, these scenes are few and far between and, unfortunately, the movie clocks in at 154 minutes. There's really only a decent short film in all of this. The movie also lacks what I would call a plot. The movie is described as three stories about one story, though that one story (ending, chronologically, with Bruce Willis and his irritating Euro girlfriend riding off into the sunset) doesn't connect the characters enough to be truly about one thing. Ultimately the movie is a prime example of what happens when a VCR and a wide selection of movies replace film school. The movie lacks a coherent center and seems more like something that was made for the sake of just committing something to film and resurrecting the flagging career of John Travolta. The movie is too large in scope to sustain itself, and, in the end, implodes because there is really no conviction behind the presentation- too concerned with being a hipster-cool riff on a crime story, rife with pop in-jokes and 70's music (perhaps the best part of the movie is the soundtrack), somebody must have neglected to mention that the movie went nowhere and lacked the momentum to even get there. While all of these qualities combine to form a truly deplorable viewing experience, I do have to mention Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson as two performers in this movie who, I felt, got away clean. Bruce Willis probably gets away with it because he's alone for the majority of his segment and, therefore, doesn't have anybody with whom to trade despicably derisible dialogue. Samuel L. Jackson gets a mention because of the scene at the very end of the movie in which he confronts Tim Roth's character and makes him realize that there are far more fearsome powers at work in the world than robbing a diner. In fact, the scenes coming directly at the beginning and the end of the movie are the two best, and everything else is filler. As you no doubt have guessed, I fall squarely in the latter of the two groups I mentioned at the beginning of this review. Pulp Fiction is inane, self-indulgent, and bloated.",1.0,AdamG87,2008/02/18,816,327
239,Moon,Can't fault it!...,There is much to admire in this film; everything from Sam Rockwell's tremendous performance to the special effects on the lunar surface (all done with miniatures). The musical score by Clint Mansell is also excellent; slowly building until the end where it really cuts loose. I thought it was good back in 2009 when I had a 30 mile round-trip to see it; but it was even better this time around. I don't know whether it's because I've seen so many other films in the mean time or what; but it really struck a chord with me this time! If you love your sci-fi then it's one I can heartily recommend. SteelMonster's verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED My score: 9.6/10.

240,Intermission,"""Not bad...F***ing delish man!""","What a superbly unique film this is! I must confess that I initially went to see it purely because of Colin Farrell, but having seen it a few times now I think it is one of the funniest films I have seen in a long time. All the characters have their own little place in this movie - even bit part characters such as the sales assistant, the girl in the coffee shop and the absolutely fantastic performance from the stone-throwing boy. Each character has it's own little idiosyncrasies from Cillian with his obsession with brown sauce, through Colin with his need for domestication (particularly a wok), and Colm with his Celtic mysticism, to the sales assistant with her tutting, and the stone-throwing boy with his need to be in amongst the action, to Deirdre O'Kane with her S&M, and Shirley Henderson's moustache topped off by Mr Henderson's `as they say in the states'. Cillian Murphy played his part to perfection - heart-rending - epitomising the agony of going the long way around to getting what you want in life. A lesson to be learnt by many in love. Colin Farrell is scarily convincing in his part as a thug - delivering some quite severe performances - yet he is still surprising easy on the eye (particularly in the scene at the beginning with the waitress). His performance is spot on - neither overplaying the spotlight, nor underplaying the rawness of his character. Colm Meaney's guard is hard-hitting, rugged, yet his character seems to have got slightly carried away with his own self-importance, making him unexpectedly more hateable than Colin's Lehiff! I don't think I could begin to say enough about this film. As an English person fascinated by the Irish, I found this to encapsulate everything I love about the Irish. True enough, if it had been shot in England or America it wouldn't have captivated me as much - but that is the point, nowhere else can be likened to Ireland in this way - we just do not have that same raw individuality that the Emerald isle possesses. First-rate acting, writing and directing. I can't wait for the DVD!",,ascky,2004/03/12,6,0
241,Moon,Film Of The Year,"Definitely the most intriguing film of 2009. A study of one mans loneliness, isolation and longing to return home. I wasn't disappointed. The look of the base, the title sequence, the muted atmosphere all added up to a film with a style very similar to the first Alien movie. The director intentionally created it as a homage to such classic sci-fi, along with 2001 Space Odyssey. It succeeds on many levels. In fact, when the character Sam Bell finds and opens a hatch on his Selene base, I half expected Ellen Ripley to pop her head out with a flame thrower. Who needs Sig weaver though, uh? This film contains a damn fine performance from Sam Rockwell! A multi-layered character who is both rich and engaging. Oh, and Gerty is cute (although perhaps an unknown voice actor would have worked better than Kevin 'K Pax' Spacey). See it! My favourite film of the year.",10.0,gunslut,2009/07/30,16,8
242,The Fault in Our Stars,Just okay,"More likely backed-up by best-selling novel from John Green, ""The Fault in Our Stars"" is an honest yet faithful love story which containing some positive messages to inspire teenagers. The plot flows as a good drama should be, thanks to screenwriter Scott Neustadter and Michael H Weber who finely adapt John Green's genius idea into a soulful play and beautiful drama. The script for two central characters, Hazel Grace and Gus are well developed. It really shows how Hazel's feeling to Gus grows as much time they've spent together and how they need each other to live despite their imperfect conditions. Besides that, the movie seems taking advantages from Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort's chemistry who easily makes an adorable couple and put some sweet moments from it. Unfortunately, ""The Fault in Our Stars"" isn't without it's faults. The other characters beside Hazel and Gus may only just supplement, seems unimportant and sometimes annoying like Van Houten character who looks stupid with his strange behavior and builds an awkward scene every time he appears. Also the film emphasizes more on meeting true love rather than people's attempt on surviving from cancer that makes it missing some points. Don't expect the drama would be as complex as ""50/50"" or ""Dallas Buyers Club"", because what ""The Fault in Our Stars"" offers is much focus on couple dating and having romantic dinner. ""The Fault in Our Stars"" is an average good and sweet drama supported by lovely performances from it's two impeccable stars. But nothing much you could get in it that makes this movie felt just enough on being okay.",6.0,aldri-feb,2014/06/24,10,5
243,Ferris Bueller's Day Off,Disappointment and a bore,"I found it very strange that a teenage boy would spend his day off at mall and fine dining. It is rather what a middle age man with bad job would do on his day off. But that 's not my biggest complaint is not that. I don't mind if movie lacks logic or realism as long as it is entertaining. My problem was that movie didn't live up to hype it got. I didn't find the movie as entertaining or funny as everyone on internet said nor I didn't find Ferris as cool or likable as everyone thinks. First let me talk about the movie. The movie was very dull, boring, slow and uneventful for me. Even the situation that happens are not so entertaining sometime. For example, take museum scene. Sure setting a scene in museum is boring itself.But that is not a big problem. A good director can make a scene set in boring classroom interesting. What makes this scene boring is that characters do nothing. They do not do any mischief, they do not destroy anything, they do not do prank or the fact that do not give any witty remarks on any painting. They just stand and stare the painting. Instead camera shows the paintings. If I had to see the painting, I would use my internet to Google some painting or if I don't have internet, I would simply go to public library and read a book about painting. When fun thing actually happen i.e.; watching baseball game , they don't show much. Only time I laughed was when Ed Rooney was humiliated. Now let me talk about Ferris Bueller himself. Even if I forget he lies and manipulate people who loves him the most, I still don't like this character. I did not find him cool at all. There is no strong reason why he is the most popular kid in school who is worshiped by everyone. Only special thing about him is his unbelievable luck. I found him boring guy who keeps on explaining why is he cool.",3.0,yashvardhan,2014/05/19,104,53

No need if your project will not realize, no need if you will have failed: what's important is to try; with determination, something will be stand to you: the fear and the courage to say: ""I'll ever attempt!"".

249,Interstellar,"Combining ENTER THE VOID, THE LAST MIMSEY and .. GENESIS","Not so much film as much as strange milestone for Hollywood. With A-List stars and a final running length of about 3 hours. This in an age where Hollywood is so desperate for profit and fast turnover that even TV shows have more commercials and less content. How is this possible? Easy answer: Nolan Brothers. Look in a mirror, say those names 7 times quickly, the Hollywood Rule Book disappears. The bizarre length effectively gives the viewer not one but three entirely separate movies joined only by the title. This reviewer in particular was gob-smacked by the first movie, effectively from the beginning until the space flight, and wanted to jump to an alternate universe where the whole movie took place in that small town, post-apocalyptic setting. With the dust. And stray drones. And the school teachers who taught that the trip to the moon was just propaganda. I cannot over-emphasize how strange this is. Even though that was not the point of the film, I suggest the production company unintentionally created (in that first hour) the best sci-fi future-world ambiance in the history of film; and, unaware of what they had accidentally done, they just moved on. BTW, a number of futurists have said that in the early part of the 21st century the odds favor at least one major volcano going ""super,"" or blowing for extended days or weeks. This will place ash/dust in the air will will cover the planet. Until this film, I never saw the image of what this might look like. Now I know. Wow.) The second film is like every Star Trek film you have ever seen, but by way of Stanley Kubrick. Not bad, but nowhere near as much fun as the first portion, Another really really cool thing is the robot that resembles one of those ladder kits you buy at Home Depot, that can form a variety of shapes. Ultra cool. Until you finally get to the third and final movie (or Act) which is meant to have profound spiritual implications but in reality only works if you have been paying careful attention for the first two and a half hours . Which is itself a strange contradiction. But the whole film is full of contradictions. There is an Epilogue too (following the unstated theme of three Acts and an Epilogue). It is fun, it is moving, it connects with the viewer, and it makes no sense at all. There are plot holes in the Epilogue that you could lose a Black Hole in. Joke intended. So, there you go, one of the oddest and most contradictory films of all time. Oh, don't even bother trying to figure out how a society that can develop AI to a degree beyond anything ever seen in film before (the Costco ladder people) still has teachers that dispute the Moon Landing and doctors who can't deal with a cough. As I keep saying, a very strange movie. But a very powerful one *** REVIEW UPDATED OCT 2016**** Greetings from the year 2016. For those reading this from the far future when everyone who wishes it has instant access to the IMDb database, probably beamed right into the cortex, I am updating my review with this addenda: I confess I missed the point of the film on first viewing. After all, this is a Nolan Bros 3 hr opus which, sadly, never really achieved a proper audience and now is more or less lost to time, much like the characters in the story. On second viewing, I ""got"" that this is basically a love story set against a sci-fi backdrop. The love of a father for his daughter, the growth of Man to a new dimensional experience where love itself is quantifiable - these are amazing concepts and this is an amazing movie.",10.0,A_Different_Drummer,2015/01/23,29,17
250,October Sky,"under-estimated, unrecognised but my favourite of all time.","i voted it 10 as it's my most loved movie of all time. It was one of those rare moments and rare feelings you get when something great comes to an end. It was never a movie which was grossly advertised or hugely popular. Very honest and real account, non of this typical Hollywood falseness you get in so many movies.. It's certainly got the x-factor in my books. I was surprised this movie didn't do a 'shawshank redemption' thus becoming hugely popular years after the movie was released. I first watched this movie years after it came out at the cinema on the back of a coach on a 6hour journey to the everglades in Florida i was with my family and we balled our eyes out. Not many people really knew about this movie and its precisely because of this; it wins my heart.",10.0,sterlingcharles,2008/03/06,10,8
251,Spider-Man 2,Spider-man some more... please!,"After being very impressed with the first one after some skepticism, Spider-man 2 is tackling a sequel with great anticipation and even greater expectations. The way Sam Raimi was able to produce the story of Spider-man with such style, realism and above all, faithfulness to the Marvel original comic is tremendous to say the least. The reason why it took this long to make a live action movie for Spider-man is due to the difficulties in making the action sequences look real and being able to connect all the side stories and characters in a single effort. Although it doesn't look flawless, it is still able to fool the eyes. The characters are also faithfully represented. Spider-man 2 is a great sequel for many reasons. First it ties right into the original without skipping a beat. Set a few years after the original with all the same actors and characters. Though it differentiates itself enough from the original so you're not watching a clone of the first. It dives deeper into the psyche and the experiences of its main character in order for you to gain a greater understanding of his situation. At the same time it still provide great visuals, pulse pounding action sequences, humorous side sequences and breath taking special effects and camera work. This movies stands head and shoulders above all super hero comic movies. It delivers what a movie goer seeks and leaves them gasping for more. Immediately after viewing, I was pondering what they will do with the next installment and i am sure that the majority of the viewers were thinking the same thing. The movie is strung together in a great sequence that never ever bores the viewer. The new villain gets a good intro which explains his situation in a neat and tidy manor. Doctor Otto Octavius is a perfect villain which is played and visually represented to perfection. The movements of Doc Ock are fantastic. It's just as i would have pictured it in my mind, if i could... while watching the cartoons or reading the comics. Only Raimi presents it in a way that connects the loose visuals in our minds with the visual reality (of course with the aid of computers). Some may complain about there being too much story, too much Peter Parker and not enough action. One must realize that if it were the other way around, that you'd be complaining that there wasn't enough storyline. People are so hard to please. Even with this seemingly flawless movie people still find something to complain about. The only thing i didn't understand was the presence of Ursala, the daughter of Peter's landlord. What was her role in all of this? Anyways, i just bought the DVD for this and realized that i should voice my opinion especially seeing how low of a score this movie got in contrast with what i would score it. Action:10 Directing:10 Acting:10 Re-watchability(if thats even a word):10 Overall rating: 10 out of 10... bravo! Bring on part 3 whoever the villain might be. Venom, Lizard, Gobblin, Scorpion, whatever. Heck bring on the sinister 6!",10.0,WilsonLau,2004/12/10,31,24
252,October Sky,"GREAT story, very inspiring!","We all loved this movie from 46 down to 7. All my boys watched with enthusiasm and interest. My middle son (9) told me, ""Mom, I see now why we shouldn't mess with rockets at home!"" :) They are all interested in everything to do with flying and space, so this was a perfect movie. The true story of the 4 boys about whom the story is written, is the essence of the American spirit to find a way to get where you want to and perseverance to accomplish your goals. Another aspect that was very valuable was the example of honoring your parents when you can't necessarily believe the same and sometimes even obey them. It was a great teaching tool. We wish there were many more movies made like this one.",10.0,bonniebo40,2007/01/28,1,1
253,Goodfellas,A terrific film which depicts the insanity of a career in the mafia.,"By and far the largest complaint I hear from people is the use of voice-over in film. Many complain of how it destroys the purpose of a movie as a visual medium. ""The actors should convey emotion through their acting, not through voice-over,"" these critics might say. I argue that in certain cases, voice-over can make a film better. ""Goodfellas"" is my proof that v/o helps a film (as well as terrific direction, masterful cinematography, Schoonmakerian editing and a killer soundtrack, but those are givens in a Scorsese flick). How else could we really understand Henry Hill's incredible story of prosperity and joy which eventually turns into one of paranoia and depression? ""Goodfellas"" is the story of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), a low ranking soldier (or something like that) in boss Paul Cicero's crew of Brooklyn wise guys. It's also about his friends and partners in crime Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) and his wife Karen (Lorraine Bracco). It begins with good times spread around, but due to some poor decision making on everyone's part, the good times don't last long. ""Goodfellas"" is a mix of black comedy and dark drama which is all the more affecting because of the humanity of the two main characters, Henry and Karen Hill. Karen is especially sympathetic due to her innocence. She tries to rationalize her husband's actions in her v/o, as Henry explains everything he thinks in his v/o. Back to the point of v/o: It is necessary for Henry to speak his mind in v/o because as ""Sopranos"" creator David Chase said, these guys usually are lying when they talk to their fellow mafia members. The one thing I haven't mentioned is the incredible acting by the whole cast. Liotta and Bracco shine here more than anyone else in the cast. (Yeah, Pesci is the most memorable part of this movie according to many other people, but he was much better in ""Raging Bull"" as was De Niro*. That's saying something about ""Raging Bull"" because Pesci won an Oscar for this film.) Everyone else here was great too. Overall, Goodfellas is a must see for any Scorsese fan. It's my favorite movie of his and I think his magnum opus. Marty grew up around these people, so who better to tell their story? *Robert De Niro is excellent movie he does. He probably even did research on the CIA and the florist industry for ""Meet the Fockers"".",10.0,kpt4001,2007/06/23,12,8
254,Pulp Fiction,Simply The Best,"To put this in context, I am 34 years old and I have to say that this is the best film I have seen without doubt and I don't expect it will be beaten as far as I am concerned. Obviously times move on, and I acknowledge that due to its violence and one particularly uncomfortable scene this film is not for everyone, but I still remember watching it for the first time, and it blew me away. Anyone who watches it now has to remember that it actually changed the history of cinema. In context- it followed a decade or more of action films that always ended with a chase sequence where the hero saved the day - you could have written those films yourself. Pulp had you gripped and credited the audience with intelligence. There is not a line of wasted dialogue and the movie incorporates a number of complexities that are not immediately obvious. It also resurrected the career of Grease icon John Travolta and highlighted the acting talent of Samuel L Jackson. There are many films now that are edited out of sequence and have multiple plots etc but this is the one they all want to be, or all want to beat, but never will.",10.0,wolvesrug,2005/01/09,1480,1076
255,Interstellar,"Thought-provoking, mind-enriching, and heart wrenching sci-fi drama.","'Interstellar' takes off by constituting its soaring ambitions right at the very first few sequences of the film: humanity is struggling to survive in a barely habitable Earth, already at the brink of total destruction. Earth and its resources is down to its last few moments, but when a wormhole, a medium that enables space time-travel beyond known limits, is discovered, scientists and ordinary men gather together, to begin an exploration that would take time-traveling through different worlds, in man's desperate search for humanity's place among the stars. To fully understand 'Interstellar', its premise and its accuracy, may require repetitive thinking, research, and a certain level of intellect—perhaps the same level Nolan asked in 'Inception'. But the film does not necessarily ask its audience to right away fully understand it, instead it begs you to feel it, to experience its dilemmas and tragedies and go through the same threads of emotion tangled up within the web of humanity's last possible moments, and the relationship between a widowed father and his children already leaning toward an anticipated end. Nolan's made sure that even the film's ideas are too far-fetched and may seem resting on towering intellectual grounds, it would nonetheless connect to its audience by delivering its message through emotionally-charged tales of human relationships, tangible enough to be felt and experienced. At its core, is retired NASA engineer, Cooper (McConaughey) and his relationship with his children—most strikingly with his daughter, Murph. Cooper's emotional journey—the decision he has to make whether to leave his family behind or join the quest to search for a new habitable planet—alone, serves as an effective vessel to transport the audience from Earth, right from the moment the spacecract 'Endurance' takes off from the ground, to the unknown limits of the cosmos. McConaughey delivers a stunning and highly-commendable performance, and while I can't say its his best, as I've managed to have seen only a few of his movies, I can certainly say it's one of the best I've seen from any actor, so far, and he may be owing that to Nolan's impeccable direction. McConaughey's incredibly brilliant portrayal of a loving father places him at the center of the story. There are plenty of nail-biting sequences here depicting his devastation after the choices he needed to make and still has to take, and in each one, he never fails to effectively convey whatever emotion the sequence requires him to deliver. Nolan's mastery of his craft screams in deafening volumes through his unblemished capacity to explore and raise the layers of the film's characters and put their stories in right places and in valid highlights within the film, and that works best with the help of brilliant musical score orchestrated by the equally impeccable Hans Zimmer. Added with breath-taking cinematography and spectacular visual effects, together, these elements, make 'Interstellar' capable of weaving a human story powerful enough to intrude through our delicate emotional senses, delve into our humanity and still go beyond that. Nolan's managed to tread through the film's seemingly absurd scope and ambitions without losing focus on the one powerful element that seems to keep the film's aspects bonded together: LOVE. As chiché as it may sound, that may be the only thing that is right away understood and easily felt in the movie. There are a lot of questions raised, and each one poses another, but none of which really requires immediate answer, and by not losing grasp of the mystery of love, and the power it can deliver to make human connections tighter and even closer amidst the ever widening physical distance between the characters in the film, Nolan comes out victorious in making the audience feel and understand 'Interstellar' and have its questions answered, in a way that doesn't necessarily oblige us to just think, but also to make our emotions work as well, so we can have the experience the film wants us to go through. Sure, it can't be perfect, I myself noticed that it lacks focus with its narrative (this either because I find it hard to solve Nolan's puzzle-like construction of the story—LOL—or the narrative' s really not just that good. If you have seen Memento and Inception, the construction here is somehow similar as those two) and some respected critics even argue this one can't be Nolan's best, and I haven't seen all his works yet, either, but for me, it really isn't that hard to put this on the list of the best sci-fi movies I've seen so far. Nolan has put up together a perfect ensemble of outstanding actors, whose powerful performances, IMO, are enough to cover the flaws. Not a single bit of every actor's potential is put into waste, here; everyone has a star to shine in this universe Nolan created. Hans Zimmer's music seems to never go out of sync, in fact it almost always goes in harmony with the dramatic highlights of the film. Visual effects is never less than top-notch; the imagery presented in this film is utterly jaw-dropping, so expect to have your breath being repeatedly taken away by the frequent outburst of colors effectively employed to establish distinctions between the dimensions. All those elements are satisfyingly sufficient to create the deciding impulse needed to bring the movie to where it aims to arrive. 'Interstellar' is a thought-provoking and mind-enriching motion picture, a grand and brilliantly depicted visual spectacle not bereft of human emotions, one of the best of its genre in a very long time. If this movie gets proclaimed as a classic in the coming decades, that definitely isn't going to come out as a surprise. This Christopher Nolan film deserves my 10 stars. :)",10.0,prospectus_capricornium,2014/11/05,331,177
256,Interstellar,Sci-Fi with a Big Heart,"The Earth in the near future is a shell of what it used to be. The plant life is dying. The very soil that used to sustain it is destroying it. There are some underground efforts headed by Prof. Brand (Michael Caine) called Lazarus to find an alternative world to settle in somewhere out there in the vast reaches of space. Three such potential worlds have been found beyond a black hole near Saturn. Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) is a retired NASA engineer who had been chosen to pilot this effort to seek out and investigate these alternative planets. Despite the stiff objections of his 10-year old daughter Murphy (Mackenzie Foy), he accepts the mission and lifted off together with his crew of three scientists, Amelia (Anne Hathaway), Doyle (Wes Bentley) and Romilly (David Gyasi). From there, we are brought on an unparalleled adventure of space, time and humanity by a master who is probably the most mentally-challenging writer and director in the film industry today, Christopher Nolan. Front and center in this spectacular sci-fi film is the timeless bond between a father and his daughter. The poetic story he has written is multi- layered and emotional, despite its scientific jargon and bleak settings. As with his other projects, Nolan works with some of the best technical talents, many of whom are award-winners in their fields. Everyone on this team are guaranteed at least Oscar nominations for their work in this film, and they may in fact all actually win. Film editor Lee Smith, sound engineers Gregg Landaker and Gary Rizzo and musical scorer Hans Zimmer together effectively create excitement and drama. The cinematography of Hoyte van Hoytema is breathtaking especially in those wide landscape shots, both on earth and on those other planets. The visual effects are innovative as ever, particularly in the third act where a whole new dimension was created. Production designer Nathan Crowley had some nifty ideas for his futuristic props. The circular design of the mother ship Endurance was beautiful in its symmetry. The designs of the robotic sidekicks TARS and CASE are in no way similar those in Star Wars. Matthew McConaughey continues his streak of acting excellence which was just capped by an Oscar earlier this year. Michael Caine was as good as he could be expected to be. However, I found his final speech too garbled to be understood well, and it contained an important plot point. Anne Hathaway's role is a bit of a puzzle for me. While she was actually managed to be credible as a scientist, she had a rather cheesy monologue that seemed out of place when it was delivered. Three talented actresses portray the character of Murphy Cooper at different ages: Mackenzie Foy, Jessica Chastain and Ellen Burstyn. Foy goes way beyond what she was required to do in her two previous hit films the ""Breaking Dawn"" films and ""The Conjuring"". Chastain is such a riveting presence as ever, and it was good to see her again after her long break after ""Zero Dark Thirty"" and ""Mama."". Oscar winner Burstyn's singular big scene made me tear up. In the second hour, I was surprised to see a special, heretofore uncredited, big name guest star portray one of the pioneer Lazarus astronauts, Dr. Mann. This was more than a mere cameo appearance, as his character had a critical role to play in one of the many twisting episodes of this story. From ""Memento"", then ""The Prestige"" to ""Inception"", Nolan had gone for the extremes in terms of plot development. His work is not always easily comprehended on first watch. They are thought-provoking and demanding in terms of a viewer's patience and concentration. ""Interstellar"" joins this stellar list, and we are brought to yet another dimension of time and space. 10/10.",10.0,3xHCCH,2014/11/06,80,41
257,Detachment,Windswept and desolate school hallways,"The truth about high school is that it's worse than you remember it. Watching Tony Kaye's enthralling ""Detachment,"" you can't help compare your high school to the one on screen. You remember the terrible teachers you had, the sterile hallways, the asinine classmates, and the absurd assignments. You can remember the ""weight that presses on everyone"" as Mr. Henry Barthes, played by Adrien Brody, tells his class. ""If you can just hang on, everything will be alright."" Mr. Barthes is that hero teacher that we love tell stories about. He's the Christ, the Buddha. He's meant to save us from ourselves. The problem? Mr. Barthes is a great teacher because he has no life outside of teaching. Like Socrates, Christ, Buddha, Gandhi, and countless other mythologized teachers, Barthes is a detached island to himself, without spouse, children, or personal life. He's a lonely dude. As a public school teacher sitting in the audience at the world premiere last night in Tribeca, I have mixed feelings about telling you that Tony Kaye has masterfully succeeded in capturing public school in a macabre and beautiful chalkboard sketch. His lush, mannerist portrait brings a gorgeous but searing light to the lonely reality of the teaching profession. Mr. Kaye's ""Detachment"" presents school the way so many of us on the inside see it: a windswept wasteland scourged of its humanity by a culture that burdens its underfunded and unfairly censured teachers with rearing, policing, and institutionalizing our children. I hate to say it: public school really is this bad. The few great teachers that our system manages to attract are barely hanging on from year to year, knocked senseless by a society that demands way too much from them. Adrien Brody is riveting as a seemingly serene but deeply damaged substitute teacher. His sloping eyebrows, sometimes treacly or overwrought in other performances, here convey an- inch-from-the-cliff hopelessness without ever becoming a mask. Mr. Brody's Henry Barthes is sweetly but searingly honest with his students even as sadly skulks among the halls of his school. Barthes is also furious-- enough to throw desks in his classroom and scream at a late night nurse at his grandfather's assisted care facility. In close-up, documentary-style interviews, Mr. Brody's eyes flash like lightning one moment and then become as dull as concrete the next, daring us to try to understand how one can care so much and so little. His Barthes has a teacher's countenance in this film, acutely aware of how important yet futile his work is. It's a career performance. Barthes' determination to be disconnected keeps him the perennial substitute-- in the classroom and in his personal life. Barthes tends to his grandfather but has more than enough time to help out two young girls, a young prostitute and an overweight loner. Despite his earnest efforts, almost none of it works out well. The complicating plot lines, all involving family surrogacy around Barthes, serve the notion that teachers must be dispassionate and alone in order to perform their jobs. The story survives its few yet regrettable school clichés by sticking to this thesis. Despite the fact that the number of big names threatens to make the movie look like a cameo-fest (Lucy Liu? Christina Hendricks? Marcia Gay Harden? Blythe Danner? James Caan? Really?), the ensemble gels together surprisingly well. After all, weren't your teachers an impossible cast of characters? Every character seems just barely above water as each trudges to the blunt beat of the school bells ringing. The performances are just fine, largely, but two are particularly successful. While Mr. Caan's grinning jester provides a refreshingly necessary gallows' humor in some of the film's darkest moments, it's Ms. Liu's imploding truth-teller that lends undeniable heft to the story. As a guidance counselor faced with yet another unreachable know-it-all teen, Ms. Liu's character finally breaks down, berating the student with a bleak prophecy of the child's future. ""You will NOT be a model! You will forever be on a carousel, competing with 80% of the country for a minimum wage job for the rest of your life!"" the guidance counselor screams uselessly at the apathetic teen. It's grim stuff, made more grave by the undeniable ring of truth. The ancient Greeks tell us ""we suffer our way to wisdom."" By the end of the film, you'll hope that is true for most of these characters. Somewhere on screen, between a silent hug and the opening lines to Poe's ""Fall of the House of Usher,"" you will find a glimmer of hope. But you have to work for it. School, as the film has drawn it, is a Munch-esque desert of detachment where the best anyone (teachers and students) can do is survive. But the fact that Barthes, and teachers like him, won't give up-- and the fact that Mr. Kaye made this movie-- tells us that hope is alive, if not well. The hope rests almost entirely in our lonely, detached teachers.",8.0,iblogamerica,2011/04/26,83,76

259,Moon,Excellent low-budget sci-fi drama with an amazing cast! ;),"Okay, here's the basic plot (without the twist-spoiler): Place: The moon. Time: A future not long from now (2030-ish I think). Sam Bell, astronaut, is working on a lunar base of some sort. He is the only person on the entire base, only assisted by an all-knowing robot called GERTY (voiced by Kevin Spacey). He has been stationed on the base for almost 3 years, his contract nearing an end, and with his flight back to earth scheduled only 14 days away, he can't wait to get back home to see his wife and daughter again. However, suddenly one of the automated moon-vehicles (harvesting rock-samples or whatever) goes awry, and he goes outside of the base to investigate it... but then something unexpected happens, and he has to change his perspective on everything. End of basic plot summary. Bell is played by the brilliant Sam Rockwell, whom you probably know from ""Charlie's Angels"", ""The Green Mile"", ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"", ""Matchstick Men"" or the equally brilliant sci-fi movies ""Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy"" and ""Galaxy Quest"". This is probably his biggest part in a movie EVER, and I doubt if he will ever get a role as big as this again (not because he's not capable or worthy of it, but because it was a HUGE performance). If you're a fan of Rockwell (or perhaps of Kevin Spacey's voice), then you will not be disappointed, as they're both great in ""Moon"". For sci-fi lovers, this movie is really a blast. It takes some inspiration from such classics like ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", ""Outland"", ""Silent Running"", ""Alien"", and others, but still manages to be unique and original, something which has become increasingly rare in the recent big-budget/massive special effects/quick fix-tradition of Hollywood nowadays. ""Moon"" achieved something great for a budget of approximately 5 million dollars, which is ridiculously low by regular movie-standards, where a feature film usually would cost ten times that amount. As for the theme of the movie, the subjects of alienation, solitude, dehumanization and disbelief are risen (among others), which often leads to some of the best movies (in my opinion), as is the case here too. All in all, this movie definitely ranks among my personal top-20 all-time sci-fi favorites, and I will presume it will be placed equally high on most sci-fi aficionado's lists. An excellent debut directorial by Duncan Jones, and clearly one of the 5 best sci-fi movies made in the last 10 years. Already looking forward to his next feature film, which allegedly is also going to be a sci-fi movie (although with a much bigger budget). Final rating: 9.5/10 - a nearly flawless movie.",10.0,KnatLouie,2009/04/20,354,283
260,Moon,"weak, implausible","I really don't understand all the positive reviews here. I came here at about 2/3 of the way through to see if anyone else thought it was a major stinker, but was surprised to see almost nothing under 8 stars. I didn't get anything even remotely philosophical about it, it's just some lonely guy slowly rotting (from...radiation? never mentioned), with a couple of hallucinations that crop up at the beginning but are never heard from again. He and the buddy hardly talk at all, no deep discussions, just some general snottiness, some collaboration, and then the end. Big wow. So many inconsistencies: if he was still alive in the vehicle, wouldn't medical monitoring have picked that up? All that massive infrastructure, and no auto-tow-truck bot to go pull the vehicle out of the dust? And why an Indiana Jones warehouse hallway of cells? Why did the vehicle have brake lights? How would a vehicle headed for earth, designed to hold solid objects possibly not kill a man? Why would its temperature be expected to remain below lethal, why would it be expected to not hit so hard as to kill anyone inside? And when he climbed in, you could see the walls wobble like they were cardboard. And on and on. Sorry, I'm not being picky, but these things just jump right out at me. And only in one shot near the end did we see anything like the reduced gravity on the moon; when the vehicle moved, the object on the back swung along merrily. And hey, let's just make all the inside door corners 45 degrees, that way we'll all know it's the future. So lazy. Usually any movie reviewed on here, no matter how awful, will have a bunch of people going OMG best thing ever, but there are always at least a few people who can smell a stinker. For some reason everyone seems to think it's all that, and I really really disagree. I rarely want to check out of a movie before the end; wish I had never watched this at all.",4.0,schnoidl,2009/10/27,58,27
261,Primal Fear,Edward Norton's finest,"This has to be Edward Norton's finest of all his films. His ability to convey facial expressions and body language makes this film even better than it already is. He has proved himself a formidable actor in this film, even though I think this is his first major movie part. His role as Aaron Stampler/Roy is just what I'd expect from the book. His ability to switch easily between the 2 characters and become 2 different people is just amazing. Not that the other actors are necessarily any worse - Richard Gere put in a commendable performance as well as a cunning attorney who also has a heart. All in all, it is a must-watch, and with Gere and Norton in this form, it becomes one to put in the home video library.",10.0,Mike-DD,2000/08/19,5,4
262,Moon,Dark side of Moon left me cold,"This isn't really a Sci Fi film. More of a psychological thriller with an absence of thrill. Not exactly the film I eagerly anticipated. Great set up, great cast, so much unfulfilled potential. From the word go I felt uneasy about this flick. The set up lacked any credibility. A multi billion dollar Helium 3 mining operation on the moon manned by just one person. Come on! Hadn't the filmmakers heard of the Apollo Missions? NASA sent three astronauts on short trips there. You seriously telling me that investors who have poured hundreds of billions of dollars into this long term operation wouldn't have provisioned for at least half a dozen employees. Just doesn't make logical sense. I also found it jarring that Sam Bell wasn't in constant contact with his bosses back home. Realistically he would be checking in with them like clockwork. And if there was a communication problem it would be a top priority to fix it, wouldn't it? I also had other problems with this film. When our protagonist first came in contract with himself I assumed he was suffering a mental breakdown. Then the filmmakers persisted with the plot line that he was indeed cohabitating the base with his clone. Why send other employees there when you can manufacture a new human from scratch? Yeah right. Makes sense to me. Or then again maybe he was indeed delusional? At that point I couldn't give a rats. I didn't care about our lead character. I was more concerned with the time I'd wasted watching this pretentious drivel. I'm a big fan of both Sam Rockwell and Kevin Spacey. Got to say that I thought Spacey was totally wasted playing the voice of GERTY, a poor man's HAL if ever there was one. Could have had Spacey's next door neighbour play the role and it wouldn't have made any difference. And those cheesy smiley faces on GERTY. Were they trying to make the computer prop look as cheap as possible? This film was about as gripping as one of those bulky space suit gloves. I'm a big Sci Fi fan. This film could just as easily been set in the South Pole. The Sci Fi element is peripheral to the story. I felt Silent Running was a much better exploration of the dilemmas faced by man stuck in the void of space. I can not work out why this film has attracted so much kudos. By all means judge it for yourselves but a word of advice, keep the fast forward button handy. This film's a sleeper, in the ZZZZZZ sense.",3.0,lloyd1018,2009/10/31,102,47
263,Detachment,Dark,"Tony Kaye draws up in this Detachment a dark portrait of a teacher's job and the US educational system, and delivers a striking but unfortunately not totally convincing movie. The film's interest lies mainly in Adrien Brody's totally nuanced and excellent performance as a troubled teacher on the verge of breaking point, within a very good cast perhaps a bit too under exploited. As for the script, it's not uninteresting, far from it, but the omnipresent darkness turns boring: after the hour mark, the viewer has enough of seeing all those depressed teachers and this completely depressing prevailing fatalism. The other big problem is the cinematography, a lot too stylized, clearly lacking coherence in its approach and ultimately turning out to be too messy, serving the story badly.",6.0,christophe92300,2013/07/30,14,10
264,The Fault in Our Stars,too ugly to keep my interest,"My patience is really tested when a romantic film has main characters that are unlikable and ugly. The girl in the film has such a nasty detestable face: what a miserable cow. How on Earth does the guy fall in love with that? Totally incredible. Never mind, the guy is better looking than her, but his looks still don't warrant a main starring role in a movie. Why does Hollywood not hire beautiful people, so that we actually may enjoy watching eye candy as the love story, comedy or drama enfolds? The scene in the Anne frank house is ridiculous. Two people with cancer on a holiday 5000 miles away from home, are going to waste their precious time, in a dismal location like that. Let Hollywood remind us for the billionth time about the jews and ww2 and the Nazis - even if it has to be jarred into a romantic film. If the pretentious girl had any inkling of real intellect, and hadn't been nurtured in her sick narcissistic ill natured-ness, she might have actually managed to go out and do something enjoyable and more out of the ordinary, rather than the obligatory US tourist Anne Frank house visit. She's as dumb as the typical sheep who can't think for themselves and simply follow the herd. Yet she goes about thinking she's so above it all. Awful smug wench, she is. Avoid this film if you're allergic to ugly people playing leading roles in ""romantic"" films that have no other effect than making you depressed.",1.0,sugarfreepeppermint,2014/12/29,18,8

266,Interstellar,"Nolan, stick to Batman or go away!","I'll try to be as objective as possible here, but unlike the premise of this film, you won't be able to travel through a wormhole and warn yourself of the impending waste of three hours. First, I'm not a SciFi fan, but rather (was) a Nolan fan, so I did want to give this film a chance. I don't claim to be a film expert by any stretch, but this movie reminded me of a similar experience with The Thin Red Line (1998) in that the entire film was a play on visual that subsequently lacked substance. Further, the visuals in this film were extremely boring! It's outer space, throw in something to look at, even if outside of textbook physics. With the exception of the black holes, it's literally black the entire time (or a Saturn backdrop)! They also poured in some heavy scores to make an attempt to glamorize the visual effects (or lack thereof). So Earth is dying, but they really never get into the why's and how's in an understandable fashion that would help to put into perspective the importance of finding another planet to live on. Life on earth seems to continue for decades after they start their mission, which only exemplifies my point. Unless Einstein himself wrote this script, the dialogue in this film is meant to be so over-the-top that nobody in the audience is meant to understand it, nor question it. I had an issue with the character development and lack of justifiable emotion. At no point in the film do you really care about any of characters because the storyline goes around like a hula-hoop. Good actors can't make up for their own lack of character development. Sure, Cooper cries when leaving his daughter, but he is on a spaceship up in outer space before his daughter can grab a tissue to wipe the tears away. I think what bothered me most, and fits the theme for lack of visual effort, were the stupid robots!!! They are basically chrome ATM machines with block appendages! If I was going to cram a bunch of people, and adequate supplies, into a spaceship, I wouldn't design the robotic assistance to be a huge box that takes up half of the cockpit! Pure visual laziness...R2-D2 was more interesting while being created 30 years ago. The more I write and think about this movie, the more I'm reminded of how awful it was. This to me was Hollywood hyping something up and ripping off movie goer's time and money!",1.0,YouCanDoBetterHollywood,2014/11/07,300,133

Why? because my dear Spidey fans and casual movie lovers, Spider-Man 2 has a better script, better character development, suspense, humor and great action sequences; something that Spidey 3 DOESN'T HAVE!!! Spider-Man 3 was so bogged down that it sputtered like a car that ran out of gasoline at the last (and worst) time of the day. If the producers and the director would've sticked to the same formula that made the first two films so great in the third installment, it would've been SO much better. Sadly that wasn't the case. Spider-Man 2.1 with all the extra bells and whistles easily trumps Spidey 3. Get this instead of waiting for part 3. You won't be disappointed.",9.0,MsFarEast,2007/08/29,10,7

True Masterpiece,"This movie goes beyond others into an elite group with movies like Facing The Giants, Good Will Hunting, Men Of Honor and others; in which the story is so brilliant and takes you to a climax higher than the usual, that it baffles you to think that there exist possibility in the human mind to create such a story. Kind of like songs, in which there are songs so brilliantly written that you can't imagine a human being writing it. I love drama, they're my favorites and I don't get bored with them especially when it's interesting; so the length, which is something complained about by a lot of people with this movie, doesn't bother me at all it just adds more interest.

269,Ferris Bueller's Day Off,I can see why people just love this movie.,"""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" is the funniest 80's movie EVER! I can list some reasons why I liked this movie so much. 1. Matthew Broderick brings such joy to us playing Ferries Bueller, a character no one would hate. Ferris NEVER gets caught, is an expert at fooling his parents, everybody likes him, and nobody can avoid his favor and all. I want to be just like him! 2. Cameron, a geek friend of Ferris, is someone that portrays everybody's weakness. He is afraid of his parents, negative, and also very sensitive of his father's favorite car. This actor who plays Cameron was very, very good. 3. The principal who tries to prove that Ferris is not innocent and also kind of jealous of Ferris, is the most hilarious character in this movie. He sorta reminds me of my principal at High School. 4. Jennifer Grey plays Ferris's annoyed sister. She was great, and her bad attitude was somewhat hilarious. 5. Charlie Sheen's cameo of a guy in police station was absolutely funny. 6. This is John Hugh's BEST flick ever. 7. Mia Sara was sweet, she played Ferris's pretty girlfriend. 8. The most memorable scene was ""Twist and Shout"" scene, where all people dance in this song with Ferris lip-synching. 9. Cameron's speechless and hopeless stare was excellent. 10. After watching this movie, I am planning to take a Day-Off of my own! Overall, I give A+ for being the best teenage movie.",10.0,holeinthahead,2000/10/28,231,155

271,The Green Mile,An Emotional Masterpiece!,"There have been a few times in my life when a film moved me to such a degree that I cry for hours after the end credits have rolled... last night was one of them. I avoided watching The Green Mile for years after my very first experience left me crying for a whole week and experiencing intense nightmares about it. One could say that I was probably not emotionally ready to handle a movie of this magnitude and while the emotions I experienced were very real to me, I never grasped the underlying messages and couldn't understand the symbolism. As a matured adult I experienced the film very differently. On the surface level, this film is about the brutal murder of two young girls which led a black man to be falsely accused of the crime and sentenced to death. The film delves into the relationships formed between the prisoners and the officers in charge, and the realization that he may be innocent of the crime. However, beneath the surface, the film is riddled with deep symbolism that makes it incredibly difficult to watch. The selection of cast members for this movie was expertly chosen - each one bringing a new layer of humanity to the overall story. Tom Hanks was breath-taking in his portrayal of Paul Edgecomb, the head guard on the mile who was greatly affected by the magical presence of John Coffey. Tom captured Paul's inner struggles beautifully and brought the character to life. The late Michael Clarke Duncan, who played John Coffey was mesmerising and I could not take my eyes off of him. His muscular physique and rough exterior made him perfect for the role but it was his ability to embody the mysterious and often naive nature of John Coffey's character that should have won him an Oscar. His character's growth throughout the film and his ultimate realisation that the only way to escape this unpleasant life is to go through with his execution are what made him so heart-wrenching to watch. Moreover, the underlying symbolism in this movie was expertly hidden and handled with care. Most notably was Mr Jingles, the little grey mouse who befriended inmate Edward Delacroix and offered him some relief from the pain he was facing as his impending execution was fast approaching, symbolising the child-like nature of the human spirit and our longing to cling to life. I found their interactions very heart-warming but it was his brutal execution that awoke a sense of hopelessness and sadness in me. Another example of this was evident in the scene where John Coffey is being led out of the prison to be taken to the house of the Sheriff who's wife was dying of brain cancer; he stops for a moment to look up at the stars and tries to share a story with the officers. Later, as he is being led to a wooded area outside the prison walls, he stops for a moment to smell the leaves on the floor and then offers them to the officers to smell. In both scenes, he portrays both the child-like wonder so many of us have lost and the lack of gratitude that we have for simple things like being able to smell leaves or look up at the stars. Finally, John Coffey epitomized three of the most beautiful characteristics any person could have: love, compassion and empathy. As I watched his character unfold, I felt drawn to the pain that he was experiencing. If I had to describe my own experience with this life, it would be through John Coffey's famous line: ""I'm tired, boss. Tired of being on the road, lonely as a sparrow in the rain. I'm tired of never having a buddy to be with, to tell me where we's going to, coming from or why. Mostly, I'm tired of people being ugly to each other.""",10.0,ventery,2018/09/20,10,8
272,Primal Fear,The Smartest Guy In Town,"Although Richard Gere has one of his juiciest roles in Primal Fear, the best performance by far is that of Edward Norton who got the film's only Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor in a stunning debut picture. It's the kind of debut that any player would like to make and the trick is to keep up a high standard you've already set for yourself. Which Norton to his credit certainly has in his career. But as to Gere he plays Martin Vail, a top criminal defense attorney who will let everyone know it if they haven't figured it out. It's a tricky part because a guy this arrogant has to maintain some kind of surface likability or else you'd never believe he'd ever win a case in front of a jury. As for movie viewers they must have a rooting interest for him as well. But Gere's definitely a guy who they make lawyer jokes about. A young altar boy has murdered the archbishop of Chicago, a mush mouth kid with a Kentucky twang played by Edward Norton. He's part of a choir of street kids that the Chicago archdiocese shows off on many an occasion. It was a particularly brutal murder, multiple stabbings and the carving of a cryptic message in the chest of the deceased. Gere makes no bones about it, he's wanting this case because of the headlines it will bring him. But when F. Lee Bailey or Johnnie Cochran offers to defend you for nothing, you don't ask questions. Which brings us to Norton who has you might have gathered is not all he seems. He's a street kid and he's used to getting over on people himself. It's one of the darkest characters ever done on screen, maybe a bit too dark for Academy tastes. That might have been the reason that Cuba Gooding beat out Norton for Best Supporting Actor with his much lighter role in Jerry Maguire. One in this film you will notice are Laura Linney as the Assistant District Attorney who Gere was once involved with and is getting a lot of pressure to bring in a guilty verdict for understandable political reasons. I also liked Alfre Woodard as the very patient judge at Norton's trial and Frances McDormand as the psychiatrist who examines Norton. If you think you've figured out what's behind Primal Fear, rest assured you haven't from this description. Let's just say everyone gets good and played here. Which brings to mind the dedication for this review. Gere's attorney character is likable, but arrogant. Back in the day I knew an attorney who was arrogant without any real reason for the arrogance. He'd love to have been Richard Gere, I'm sure he saw himself that way. So to you Ron D'Angelo this review is dedicated to.",9.0,bkoganbing,2008/09/27,99,87
273,Death of a Salesman,Old-Fashioned but Nevertheless Excellent,"The salesman of the title is Willy Loman, a man in his early sixties, approaching retirement. Despite his long service, travelling from his New York base all over New England in the service of his employers, he has never enjoyed great success in his job. He is in financial difficulties, struggling to pay the mortgage on his house and the instalments on the consumer goods- refrigerator, vacuum cleaner, car- which were becoming popular in the forties but which represented a major commitment, even in middle class households. In order to make ends meet, he has taken to borrowing from his old friend Charlie. His sense of failure, however, does not derive solely from his unsuccessful career. He also sees himself as having failed in his private life. Although his marriage to his loyal wife Linda has survived, despite the fact that he has on occasions been unfaithful to her, his relationships with his two sons are strained. Biff, the elder, showed promise when young in both the academic and sporting fields, but failed to win a place at university after failing a maths exam at school, and since has become a rootless drifter, alternating between dead-end jobs and petty crime. Biff has been particularly alienated from his father since discovering one of Willy's affairs. Happy, the younger, has been more successful than Biff in his career, but in his private life is a selfish, cynical womaniser. Willy is much given to violent mood swings, alternating between exuberant over-optimism and despairing pessimism. The younger Willy's optimism was largely focused on his own career, believing that he had a talent for making himself ""well liked"" which would lead to a brilliant career. The older Willy's hopes are mostly focused on his sons, especially Biff, whom he still believes (in the teeth of all the evidence) to be capable of great things. When his son disappoints him, Willy turns on him fiercely, accusing him of being a ""lazy bum"". Biff's lack of success in life does indeed derive partly from his own weaknesses, but Willy's unrealistic expectations are also partly to blame; Biff would probably be happiest working with his hands, but Willy tries to pressure him into taking a white-collar job. The film follows the play in that on a number of occasions the action switches abruptly from the present into the past, as the characters act out episodes from earlier in Willy's life. Some of these episodes, in fact, may exist only in Willy's imagination, particularly those involving his wealthy older brother Ben, who is now dead although that does not prevent him from making several appearances. Ben, in fact, is not really a character in his own right, but rather functions as a symbol of the failures and missed opportunities in Willy's life. At one time filmed versions of stage plays were done in a similar way to theatrical productions (the Marlon Brando/Vivien Leigh ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" from the early fifties is a good example), but in the seventies and eighties the general tendency was to ""open them up"" by filming on location as well as on studio sets, by taking liberties with the playwright's text, often making significant changes to the plot and even introducing extra characters. ""Death of a Salesman"", although it was made as late as 1985, has a very old-fashioned feel to it. It not only keeps Arthur Miller's plot unchanged, but also follows his text almost literally to the word. There is no attempt to open it up; it is filmed entirely on stylised, deliberately artificial-looking sets similar to those that would be used in a theatre. Normally I would take the view that the cinema and the theatre are two different media and that one should not try to imitate the other. This film, however, was originally made for television and based on a Broadway production, and works better on the small screen than it probably would do on a big one. It is, in fact, a very good film, despite its old-fashioned, theatrical look. The main reason, apart from the quality of Miller's original play, is the quality of the acting. Dustin Hoffman called the role of Willy Loman his favourite acting experience; it is certainly one of his best, although not in my view his very best. (That remains ""The Graduate""). He brings out all the complexities and contradictions in Willy's character, a man who is certainly difficult, perhaps even impossible, but at the same time also tragic and pitiable. The play has been seen as a critique of the capitalist economy or of the American way of life. That is one possible interpretation, but there is more to it than that. It also deals with the plight of the elderly, especially those whom society no longer seems to value, with the human need, too often disappointed, to aspire to a better life, and with the gap between appearance and reality. On a more personal level it is also a character study and an exploration of the relationships within a family, especially father-son relationships. This means that the supporting cast has to be strong, and Hoffman certainly receives strong support, especially from Kate Reid as Linda, Charles Durning as Charley and above all from John Malkovich as Biff. The result was an excellent production that brought out the various levels of meaning in Miller's play as well as the tragedy of its central figure. 8/10",8.0,JamesHitchcock,2005/09/16,26,24

Once Matt Damon rears his ugly head you can now confirm your suspicions that this film has been compromised by illogical tripe. Damon delivers his usual trade mark wince and grimace to let the moviegoer know this script has changed yet again. The big lie is that this film is being hyped as a better science fiction movie than 2001, NOT. Anne Hathaway looks like a clueless deer in the headlights when she is supposedly a top astrophysicist. Matthew McConaughey plays a top mechanical engineer that is now a farmer due to a world filled with way too many people. The typical message from the Marxist Hollywood crowd is ever so present, the earth is turning into a dust bowel from global warming, kids can't follow their dreams as grade school will determine their careers (Outcome based Education), but it gets better when the Karl Marx penned phrase ""For the greater good"" is the basis of this long drawn out ball of crap called Interstellar.

It was too slow in some parts and it seemed the movie had no sense of direction in some parts, which made me uninterested. Joe Pesci, got under my thick skin, which proves how well he lived this character. He wasn't acting. Some of his scenes I will never forget. Liotta also proved to me he is an actor of high caliber. It was also interesting to see De Niro in a supporting role than the lead. I think this movie is tad-bit overrated, especially for its direction.

Was it predictable? Of course. Its an animation geared towards children (what would you expect?) -but like most of the animation movies of today, there were quite a few 'hidden humor' spots as well which would be completely missed by the younger audience (not unexpected since it is the adults, after all, who are forking over the bread and it doesn't hurt to keep THEM entertained as well). The movie is fairly fast-paced and the animation well done. I'm usually a little apprehensive when I've harbored good expectations from a movie based on clips/previews, but in this case I felt it truly delivered. This one will be added to our library when it (eventually) hits the shelves. Too many people look for a great amount of depth and unpredictability in animation movies -but THAT is a bit unrealistic (no pun intended) -think about it: These things USED to be called CARTOON MOVIES for a reason.

279,The Green Mile,Heavy handed,"Made with little subtlety, grace, or wit, suffers from the same disease as Shawshank in seeking profundity in every vignette. Whereas I could overlook some of the preposterous and contrived situations in Shawshank and just enjoy the movie, the Green Mile just seemed contrived except for a few scenes and characters. Of course it has redeeming qualities about it, namely Duncan's performance and the gripping execution scenes. I like Shawshank alot despite its flaws, however The Green Mile is just plain mediocre, not one I would ever want to sit through again. It could have been a decent 90 minute movie. The far too long and frequent mouse vignettes detracted and cost the movie momentum, there is no need to show a guy pee 10 times in the movie, we understand that it hurts when he pees, enough already!. The evil prison guard was just far too simple and one-dimensional a character to the point of absurdity which eliminates the impact of his comeupance at the end, contrast this with the very satisfying end to Shawshank's prison warden (a far more interesting, faceted, and believable character). The end was diluted as well, I think the movie went a scene too far at the end into some fuzzy preaching, as a viewer it really wasn't necessary, the impact of Duncan's end on the Hanks character and the viewer is strong and moving and the movie should have ended there instead of having a scene to explain to the audience (as if to a slow fifth-grader) the truth of the moment.",1.0,MattB-5,2001/01/05,73,24

282,Taxi Driver,A wonderfully engaging and convincing slide into a modern madness from a director and actor showing some of their best form,"Travis Bickle is a Vietnam veteran who cannot sleep at night and just ends up travelling around. To try and use the time effectively he becomes a taxi driver. Things start to look up for him as he works nights and slowly starts to live a little bit. He meets a girl, Betsy, and arranges to see her a few times despite the fact that he is a little bit out of the ordinary  a quality that seems to interest her. His connection to the night allows him to see young prostitute Iris being bullied by her pimp Matthew and he begins to see his role to perhaps save her  him playing his part in cleaning up the sewer that he feels New York has become. However when his view of normal life puts Betsy off him he starts to retreat more and more into the night, looking for meaning in his life and growing more and more outraged by the world he is part of. Hardly the most uplifting of films it is engaging and impressive and truly deserves the reputation it has. Martin Scorsese and Paul Schrader have produced a film that convincingly portrays a man cut out of society who has the slightest connection to normality before finding it eroded away. The script is brilliant because the detail is engaging but it is this descent into a very modern type of madness that drives the film forward. Travis has just enough about him that is recognisable that it makes it so easy to go along with the rest of his madness. A major part of this is getting the feeling right about living in a cesspit; a city that seems to have forgotten its way morally  New York is the strongest example but elements of it could be parts of any city I suspect. In painting this world in such a real way, Scorsese has made Travis all the more convincing and, to a point, all the easier to follow in his fall. Like I said it is not a film to morally uplift you but one that is depressingly fair. There is no redemption in this modern world and although it appears that the violence at the end somehow redeems Travis in reality by showing ""society"" accepting his action it drags the rest of us down nearer the world that he hates and has become part of. I love King of Comedy for the same reason albeit in a different world. Scorsese injects a real understanding of the place and a real sense of foreboding into even the earliest scenes. He inserts clever and meaningful shots into scenes that other directors might just have filmed straight and his choice of scene and shot compliments the script is depicting Travis descending into madness. What makes the film even better is De Niro showing the type of form that makes his recent form such a major disappointment. He is outstanding as he moves Travis from being relatively normal to being eaten up from the inside out. His eventual implosion is impressive but it is only as impressive as the gradual slide he depicts over the course of the film. Although he dominates it, others impress as well. Foster stands out in a small role, while Keitel makes a good impression as the pimp. Shepherd is not quite as good but her character was not as well written as the others so it isn't all down to her. Regardless, the film belongs to De Niro and although the quotable scenes are the ones that are remembered it is in the quieter moments where he excels and shows genuine talent and understanding. Overall an impressive and morally depressing film that deserves its place in cinematic history. The portrayal of a city and a man slipping into moral insanity is convincing and engaging and it shows how well to ""do"" modern madness and the effects of the moral void of parts of society. Scorsese directs as a master despite this being at an early stage in his career and De Niro is chillingly effective as he simply dominates the film in quiet moments and quotable moments alike. I rarely use phrases like ""modern classic"" because I think they are lazy but this is one film that certainly deserves such a label.",,bob the moo,2006/02/13,191,158
283,Hotel Transylvania,Quite Funny,"Dracula, who operates a high-end resort away from the human world, goes into overprotective mode when a boy discovers the resort and falls for the count's teen-aged daughter. As far as plots go, this one is pretty simple and not all that deep or clever. The characters are also not that deep. Often, this will take away from a film (or completely ruin it, like it did for ""The Good Dinosaur""). But this was also a very funny movie, and that more than made up for it. I confess that I was hesitant about it being a film coming out of the ""Adam Sandler camp"". It seems Sandler has more misses than hits these days, but this was clearly a hit. Funny for both adults and children, great use of characters to drive the humor home. I wasn't super-crazy about Andy Samberg's character (who sounded like Steve Zahn), but it wasn't a deal-breaker.",7.0,gavin6942,2016/04/25,4,3
284,October Sky,Jake Gyllenhaal's BEST Film...maybe EVER!,"This was the film that made me a ""Gyllenhaalic"". I just loved Jake's work in this film. I liked the film and the story so much, I even read the book by the real Homer Hickam called ""The Rocket Boys"", which was the original name of this movie but Universal decided to change it to ""October Sky"". I do like the name ""October Sky"". Anyway, Jake's performance was his best to date. I have just seen ""Jarhead"" recently and it was awful. But then again, I don't like military films. I think that I'll always like ""October Sky"" unless Jake does a film better than this but I don't know if he could top this film but I don't doubt it. Even the trailer to ""October Sky"" is sort of a tear-jerker. I have seen a lot of Jake films from ""City Slickers"" to ""Jarhead"" but this one ranks as his GREATEST to date. I love this film!!!!",10.0,Andrew_Lincoln_Fan,2006/01/01,1,1
285,Spider-Man 2,A Flawless Super Hero Movie,"This is what a good summer movie should be. Spider-Man 2 transcends the boundaries of being just another comic book movie to being a richly character driven movie with a very conflicted hero. Here, for the first time, we see the actual emotion behind the facade of the hero behind the mask. Gone is the richly colorful look of the first part, here in Spider-Man 2, we are plunged into a world of shadows and off colors. Picking up two years after the first Spider-Man left off, Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) has his hands full with three full-time jobs. He is going to school full time, he is working full time to pay off his rent, and he is a hero always on call whenever he hears a siren. Not to mention, we see the emotional toll that has been taken on him, his only surviving family member, his Aunt May (Rosemary Harris), has become consumed with grief and loss over the death of her husband (incidentally, creating Spider-Man in the first part), Peter's friend Norman Osborne (James Franco) is now at odds with him since he has become consumed with revenge over Spider-Man killing his father (the Green Goblin), and his love affair with Mary Jane-Watson (Kirsten Dunst) is slowly being extinguished because he is never there for her to return the feelings she has for him. And this is all in the first fifteen minutes of the film. As Spider-Man, Parker is even in danger of losing his powers as his exhaustion slowly begins to take over. Is it medical or is it because he has stretched himself too thin? Eventually, Peter decides to give up being Spider-Man to finally bring peace into his life. There is a brilliant sequence in this film when we see Parker returning to his alter-ego from the first part before the mutated spider bite as he puts on his glasses again, clouding his vision to the world around him. When he sees someone being beaten up in an alley, he turns around to walk away. When the familiar sirens fly past him again, he just eats a hot dog. In short, Parker has finally succumbed to being a New Yorker. In the midst of all of this, we see the creation of a new villain, this time in the form of a deranged scientist named Doctor Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina), who has four frighteningly powerful arms welded to his spine after a disaster with his life's work. This disaster not only turns the Doctor into Dr. Octopus (Doc Ock as the papers call him), but the artificially intelligent arms seemed fuse to his id, placating his desires to not want his life's work to be a failure. Doc Ock will try again at the expense of anyone around him. The standout here is Tobey Maguire, who can convey the film's entire heart with a look or a gesture, but is most heart-wrenchingly done in his hesitations. For a man so used to having quick reflexes, when he has to slow down and realize what is going on around him, we are instantly in his head. Maguire also has to command the screen as Spider-Man and convince the audience that he can stand up to someone like Octavius and not seem fantastic. Sam Raimi also does a knock-out job as well, knowing when to hold on a character's face long enough or swinging the camera along with Spider-Man to give the audience the exhilaration of flight. Raimi is more than competent enough to give this movie the look and feel of a moving comic book and by utilizing his most signature camera shot (zooming into and out of the character's eyes), the audience is invited to live for a moment in the tights of a superhero. Spider-Man 2 has so many great messages to be heard in this film, the best of which seems to draw both Peter and Octavius together in the end: In order for the right thing to be done, does it mean that we have to put away what we want the most? In both cases, there are some strong arguments and that is what makes this movie such a surprise is the depth that it possesses. Seemingly, we have entered the bizarro world of sequels, where they seem to surpass the original (Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, Toy Story 2, etc) and Spider-Man 2 definitely joins these ranks. Perhaps in allowing a series to expand rather than compliment the original, we can expect more depth out of movies, which has been as equally absent in this day and age as heroes as Spider-Man 2 also suggests.",10.0,john_murdoch2002,2004/06/30,397,291

287,October Sky,Back to the Fifties,"This movie is a real sleeper. It is a portraiture of an extremely significant time in America. We have people leading their everyday lives (in this case, in a coal mine), and the incredible threat that the Russians have created with Sputnik. Enter Homer Hickham who has been inspired. The whole town sees him as a nut. He gets some of his nerdy friends to help him realize his dream. it's a modest dream. To send a small rocket a fair distance into the sky. During this process he must deal with metals, heat properties, and mathematics. He also must face the dismay of his father, played by Chris Cooper (could have been an Academy Award), who expects Homer to naturally move into the world of the mine without a single thought. We all know what happens, but it doesn't matter. It's the wonderful series of failures and regrouping and, at one point, giving up that makes this movie. The people are real people. All Homer wants is a chance to get out this place and realize his dream. He has watched the football playing brother get all the attention. There's nothing for Homer. I could watch this movie over and over. It really works. It should have had a lot more attention.",8.0,Hitchcoc,2006/03/06,1,1

The scenes in which they first arrived to the hotel maybe confusing but will end up getting better and explained. All star cast. Shame that Adam Sandler wasn't mentioned as being producer,director ,or star of the movie.

290,Interstellar,"Nolan's masterpiece, one of the best sci-fi movie","I have been a cinema lover for years, read a lot of reviews on IMDb and everywhere, and never found the right movie to write my first review. I always thought I would wait for THE movie. And this is IT! When I first heard that Nolan was preparing a sci-fi movie, I felt like a kid again, waiting for his Christmas gift under the tree. I knew it would become a classic. And I'm sure it will. First of all, it is incredibly beautiful to watch. Honestly, it was so beautiful that I felt like I was sucked into the movie. The way Nolan decided to show some scenes really remind me of 2001 A Space Odyssey (actually many things will probably remind you of this movie). We can feel the talent of Christopher Nolan, just by looking at the way it is filmed. The techniques he used contribute to create that visual environment in a believable way. The sound environment is just mesmerizing. It is a very important part of the movie, because some scenes take place in space, and Noland just found the right way to use sound. The soundtrack (made by the great Hans Zimmer) is breathtaking, epic, amazing, unreal. I could find a lot more adjectives to qualify it, but you have to hear it to understand how epic they are. These two important parts (image and sound) create a stunning atmosphere. You will forget you are in a movie theater, and you will be lost in space, sucked into the adventures of this new Space Odyssey, begging for more. It is a truly unique experience. I can say that I have never felt something like that in a movie theater (at least not for the past ten years). Then, of course, the cast. First of all, Matthew McConaughey. I discovered this actor in Tropic Thunder, but he didn't really convince me, though he was quite funny. Then I saw Dallas Buyers Club. Since that movie, I love him. In this movie... Well, he is the movie. I exaggerate a bit, since there are other great actors (some even unexpected with a special guest) who play extremely well. But he is just what was needed to feel the human part of the story (which is very important in Interstellar). He is capable of making us feel so many different emotions all along the story, as a father, as a human. Anne Hathaway was very convincing, all together the actors managed to create some harmony, which makes the human interactions credible. Caine, Chastaing and Affleck are a perfect choice. And then there is... The special guest, I will call him ""X"". His role, which could be seen as a minor role, is actually much more important than that. He proves, once again, that he is a great actor. Watch and see. And finally, the scenario/story. I won't spoil anything here; I'll just try to convince you how great it is. Nolan is known to revolutionize everything when he tries a new genre in cinema. Well, once again he did it. With The Dark Knight he revolutionized the superhero genre. With Interstellar he's revolutionizing the sci-fi genre in cinema. From what I heard, he worked with a physicist (in gravitational physics and astrophysics) to help him with that movie. And we can feel and see it. During the fifties, Asimov laid the foundations of modern science fiction. Lucas and Kubrick did the same in cinema. Today, Nolan is laying the new foundations of the genre in cinema, proving that cinema is still at the beginning of what can be done (brace yourselves my friends, we have not seen anything yet). Why? Well, simply because we only know a few things about space, some things can't be proved for the moment, so we can use theory, and make the best of it. That is exactly what Nolan did. He used theories that exist today, and made a movie about mankind, about pioneers, about humanity, about us. Because, in spite of all the sci-fi aspect, it is a story about humanity. McConaughey, Hathaway, and mainly ""X"", will managed to convince you about that. My rating for this movie can only be a 10, because in itself, it is a beginning for a new kind of cinema. It IS a classic. Those who say ""we can't compare this movie to 2001 Space Odyssey, nor can we compare Nolan to Kubrick"" are wrong. We can, and we should. Talented people don't live only in the past, some genius live today, among us. And Nolan is one of them. Many say that he is overrated. I truly don't think so. Only time will answer that. This is the sci-fi movie of the decade, and probably the best movie Nolan ever made. Just go for it, without a second thought.",10.0,pipoulefr,2014/11/05,3810,2842
291,Goodfellas,Scorsese's Greatest Film,"I admit that I was a little disappointed with Raging Bull, and Taxi Driver was incredible, but Goodfellas is without a doubt Scorsese's greatest achievement. Every single, blood-soaked, foul-mouthed moment in this entire movie was made even better by DeNiro's and Pesci's performances and Scorsese's directing. After the opening scene when Tommy (Pesci) is stabbing Batts in the trunk, my eyes were glued to the screen; and for two and a half hours, I didn't even feel like I was watching a movie. The performances in this film by everyone are so thorough that it is impossible to tell they're acting. No other crime film has ever kept me entertained, interested and alert as long or as effectively as Goodfellas. After I saw the Godfather and didn't think it measured up to the hype at all,(it was still an amazing movie, don't get me wrong), I concluded that I was simply not a fan of gangster films. However, Goodfellas really changed my mind. Although it is not my favorite of all time, it has destroyed my indifference to this undoubtedly fantastic genre.",10.0,jpriest75,2009/06/16,17,10
292,Detachment,Education without virtue,"What struck me as very odd, as not in keeping with the inner madness and dysfunction of the characters, was that the school was clean, the lockers shined and the hallways clear of graffiti. One would expect an unkempt facility would be another sign of the inward struggles going on in everyone's life. That is usually the outcome of schools in failure. is it not? The House of Usher was the exact metaphor for that school, the outward sign of inward decay. But what would have been able to fix it? A handful of teachers? In my opinion, the absence of God throughout the characters' lines, and the lack of respect for Him, which is the present preoccupation and intent of today's administrations, led this particular school to decline. Education and knowledge will never be enough when it is not mixed with virtue, and what this movie shows is the price of such an environment, which, I think, speaks for most of American educational institutions. There are no absolutes being taught. Everything is up for grabs. Kids are being told to decide life as they see it. Anything you want to believe is okay. But, if we don't teach our kids to accept the most stable spiritual foundation, the Judeo-Christian belief system, we'll continue to get what is represented in this film, a mass of people wondering just what is worth believing, what stabilizes. It's not merely about education, but an education glued to virtue.",10.0,dbrayshaw,2014/11/25,4,3
293,Spider-Man 2,"Excellent movie, with almost no negatives, if there any","This movie starts off right where the first one left off. Peter Parker continues saving people as Spider-Man, however the misunderstood Doctor Otto Octavius, a.k.a. Doc Oc is standing in his way and is backed by Harry Osbourne, who is still extremely mad at Spider-Man for killing his father, Norman. Peter faces all the hardships of a superhero, watching Mary Jane off with Jonah Jameson's son, John and watching his best friend Harry Osbourne drink himself into a frenzy. Eventually he has a tough choice to make; stop being Spider-Man and live a normal life while the city crime rates soar, or continue as Spider-Man and watch his social life go down the toilet. Doc Oc also looms in the wake, attempting an experiment that could destroy th city. More than one secrets are revealed and those secrets and who they are revealed to may surprise you. Definitely a great performance by Toby McGuire and Kirsten Dunst and solid directing job by Sam Raimi. The special effects are very good and they do an excellent job during the fight scenes.

294,Intermission,unusual movie,"Watched this movie to see Colin Farrel struggling again with an Irish production filmed in his beloved Dublin. Very pleasant, light and well acted; it recounts many people handling of their disappointing lives (except for Farrel who seems satisfied with what he does). All their stories eventually cross in a plot blending love, mobbing, sexual and job unsatisfaction but everything is really convincing... The picture could remind a bit of Ken Loach style for its telling about lack of money and of a good job pushing people to do bad things but it's definitely less committed.

I always like Richard Gere, and as I remember, he gave a fine performance here too. But EN was just spectacular, and totally threw me off when he revealed himself not to be ""mental"" at all. He was totally creepy and then evil. He sucks you in, then spits you out and you had no idea it was coming. Now that I see that Edward Norton is starring in ""The Illusionist"" I am looking forward to seeing that, if just to watch him alone. I think we will continue to see great performances from this guy.",8.0,terracenl,2006/08/20,4,4
297,Spider-Man 2,Wow. Just wow.,"I'm a comic book fan and film buff. Have been for years. But I NEVER rushed out to see this movie in the theatre. In fact, I waited until I could watch it on DVD. Why? Mostly because the first movie, while good, didn't really strike me as 'great'. But there I was on my day off; no wife, no talk-during-the-movie friends, and most importantly, no audience to prompt me to laugh or groan or when to say 'whoa'... and I was whoaing. A lot. Picking up where the first movie left off, this is undoubtedly one of the greatest superhero movies ever, even surpassing the first. But despite being a great comic book movie, it is SO much more... it is a great 'FILM', comic book or otherwise. Good character development and interaction, perfect integration between live action and CG, a beautifully developed bad guy, strong performances, great cinematography and visuals, pathos and even an ending, that while leaving it open to sequels, DOESN'T make you feel cheated in the end! I truly believe that ANYONE could watch this movie and enjoy it. Incredibly-choreographed fight scenes, an involving, realistic story, romance and a sprinkling of comedy are all balanced together nicely in an unbelievable movie. And now that you've read all this you're gonna be disappointed, right? Let me leave you with the same thought process that I had when I sat down to watch it: just remind yourself of everything that happened in the first movie and think, ""Sure, anybody with superpowers has it easy, right?"" 10 out of 10.",10.0,da_flipboy,2005/06/20,15,10
298,October Sky,America just before the beginning of the Apollo program,"Despite the fact that the main characters are a couple of years older, this film has much in common with ""Stand by me"" (1986, Rob Reiner). For 17 year old high school students there are surprisingly little troubles with love affairs in the plot, and this benefits the film. Instead of girls the relation of the main character with his father is really important. Just like in ""Stand by me"" the main character suspects that he is less favoured than his brother. His father has always time when his brother has a football match, but is always busy when he is crafting his mini rockets. The father works at the local mine, a major employer in the small village. He expects that his son will follow in his footsteps. You almost hear Bruce Springsteen sing ""I come from down in the valley. Where mister when you're young. They bring you up to do like your daddy done"" (1980, The river). His son has other plans and is encouraged in this by his schoolteacher. This schoolteacher (Laura Dern) plays the role of the unconventional teacher, but in a totally different way than Robin Williams in ""Dead poets society"" (1989, Peter Wear). In ""Dead poets society"" the teacher learns his wealthy pupils to care about thinks that are not related to making a career. In ""October sky"" the teacher learns her poor pupils to set their ambitions regarding their career not to low.",7.0,frankde-jong,2019/07/21,1,1
299,Detachment,Overrated,"First lets start off with the good: Cast: Wow, great cast...Adrian Brody, Christina Hendricks, Bryan Cranston, James Caan, Lucy Liu. Acting: I generally like Adrian Brody. He is perfectly cast for this part. Generally there is nothing to complain about regarding any of the acting in the movie. Very well done. Dialogue: Good dialogue is important. Especially for a movie like this which is entirely character driven. Adrian gives some nice moving speeches and James Caan has some quite witty humorous lines. Overall, the dialogue is good. Vision: The creators of the movie were trying to create a movie that showed the reality of hopelessness in struggling urban school environments. I understand the 'detachment' they are trying to convey and applaud them for trying not to dress it up to much with a Hollywood tale. However, there are some problems with the execution of the vision which leads me to... The bad: Script: If a strong script is important to you: avoid this movie. The story relies on sucking you in to the emotional performances of the characters to create its meaning. Poor directing/Tries to hard: Unfortunately, many of the scenes are a little over the top. In its attempt to make us feel we witness scene after scene of extreme behavior. The chance to connect with the subtle emotions of real life drama are lost and we are caught up in a melodrama. The movie tries hard to make you ""FEEL"" something. Its a little like a sales pitch for sadness. I found myself getting annoyed at certain moments like I was in a live showing of Dave Letterman and the audience 'laugh' sign pops up to tell you what to do only here its this is your cue to ""feel this _____ emotion"". Overall, I found myself feeling like Rick Groen of the globe summed this movie up the best saying: ""Ultimately, Detachment invites us to feel precisely what it warns against, detached."" I enjoy curling up with a tub of ice cream and feeling depressed about life as much as the next person. However, I need my movies to be the whole package if they are going to take me there. Here about halfway through I found myself wanting to skip ahead some scenes because they were boring me. Indeed I felt a little detached.

You see the spaceship vibrating all the time but the faces of the actors are not reflecting the shaking or the gravitational pulls. But, of course, they make lots of ugly faces. You should see the movie Stealth to learn a thing or two about this kind of special effects. The robot is the most ridiculous thing in the movie.

302,Detachment,"Powerful, yet overwrought","To sum up what Depressi- I mean Detachment is like, just realize this is a grand social critique by the man who directed American History X. This leads me to only one way to describe Detachment: its heart is in the right place and it has some compelling drama going for it, but it's too over the top to present its social critique in a completely convincing manner. In a way, the same problems that plagued American History X now plague this film. Our main character is a substitute teacher named Henry Barthes, played by Adrien Brody whose face has a melancholy quality that makes him a natural fit for this film. In addition to merely teaching what the school wants him to teach, he actively tries to engage the students on an emotional and ethical level, to teach them things about life and so on. He goes on about the corrupting influence of the media and how the students must learn to think for themselves, etc. You'd think that would be enough to fill one film, but we also get a prostitute Henry pick up off the streets and tries to take care. There's also Henry's dying grandfather who lives in a nursing home and various employees at the school with problems of their own. The film thus tries to paint an enormous critique of the high school system through various characters. What the film has going for it, are the same things American History X had going for it: great acting and drama. Adrien Brody and the rest of the cast are all quite great, particularly Brody. The film is at its preachy best during the classroom scenes where Henry outlines several societal critiques in his bid to truly educate his students in his short time there. Several other scenes, including one where Henry verbally lashes one of the nursing home's employees for not taking care of his grandfather's needs, also have a great sense of drama and whether or not you'll like/love/hate the film, there is no doubt that watching Detachment is an impactful, intense experience. The thing that really hurts this film, however, is the same thing that hurt American History X: over the top melodrama (complete with slow-motion). As the film goes on, the film becomes increasingly melodramatic to the point that it becomes detrimental to the messages the film intends to spread. When an important, tragic character dies at the end, it feels too much as if the film – like American History X – suffers from It's Not A Good Story, Unless Someone Dies syndrome and that's not what you want. You want the death to feel deserved, which I feel this film did not. Also detrimental are the amount of well-known actors in this film. This is one of those cases where the amount of stars don't mix with the type of film. An art-house film featuring a star-studded cast hurts its aims for 'realism'. In the end it's easy to see this film has its heart in the right place. One can sense the anger behind all the social critique delivered in its scenes. Yet it is director Tony Kaye's overwrought sense of drama that makes the film devolve into an ever increasing spiral of sadness and darkness which makes it hard to deliver the Big Message without alienating the audience. Too much melodrama can turn off an audience and that's what happened for me. The film started off incredibly well, featuring lots of well-delivered social critique, but by the end – especially when (spoiler) the overweight girl died – the film became too dark and cliché-ridden. There was no light at the end of the tunnel, no subplots that ended well. Now, this is of course in line with the aims of the film, but how can I stay open to its messages when all it gives me is a nonstop portrayal of a society trapped in a downward spiral, regardless of the truths the film contains?",6.0,lucasversantvoort,2015/05/06,6,4

De Niro almost takes a backseat to Pesci. Liotta, as raconteur, delivers the story pitch perfect. So why only 5 out of 10 (""bing a bang"")? The characterisations are marvellous but the message is an empty bag. The message is merely that ""might is right"" and life is short. The bigger you are, the more friends you have, the more weight you can throw around. Well, we know that. We knew that when a nuke was dropped on Hiroshima. There is no sincere message from the movie. There are plenty of lovable characters but nothing else to feed us. You get more, much more, from Allen's Broadway Danny Rose. From the Godfather you learn about the organisation of the underworld. However, they say movies are more about character than plot. Maybe that applies to the message too. It's good. It's fun. But you don't learn anything from it other than a few syllables that every other kid at college would know.

This is a period of DeNiro's career when he was consistently churning out Oscar calibre performances one after another. He had this movie, Godfather Part II, The Deer Hunter, Raging Bull all within the same basic time frame. When DeNiro and Scorsese were teaming up to make movies it was the best actor/director combinations in movie history. You had the best mind for movies in Scorsese working with the best on screen performer of his time. It's a study of a man who's completely alone in the world even when surrounded by other people.

I'm not one for romantic sad stories, but there are a few movies out there in this category that I have loved. I heard from many that they loved this movie and they cried the whole time... I don't see how. I didn't shed a tear, and I was expecting just from the previews on TV that the boyfriend also had cancer and would be the one to die. Maybe I just was mentally prepared for it to happen and that's why I wasn't so shocked. I just didn't like it.. The part when they're in Amsterdam visiting the author I feel like that could have been better. I was honestly bored watching this. The actors were okay but the story it self I wasn't ""hooked"" on like most people were. I'm guessing the book was a lot better and was what caused all of the hype to see this..",5.0,maritzanicole5,2014/06/18,5,3
307,Crash,Overrated,"This film's supposed outlook on racism as well as the human condition is so long and drawn out though it has its occasional moments. This film's struggle to gain the Oscar is easily viewed as there are recycled plots from other movies,Characters that are overplayed and writing that a six year old could have done. How easily it gained an Oscar though for its linking up of all the characters, now done in another pile starring Brad Pitt, people expecting a experience that will blow them away will leave unsatisfied and annoyed, but if you want to watch a movie for the sake of watching a movie wait till it comes out in the bargain bin.

308,Death of a Salesman,Annoying,"Perhaps I shouldn't say it was annoying, but it certainly seems an awful bore to me after all the buildup many people I know who said it was a damn good picture! Well, what am I to do but complain about all the bickering and yelling Dustin Hoffman, the husband, gives to his whole family because he is a retired old and completely paranoic about his whole life situation, and treats his two sons the same way. It was a life story told in a few unneeded flashbacks, which to me confuses the issues. The poor soul dies and leaves his legacy which is nothing. I will admit the acting was super though.

309,Intermission,Great Great and Great!,I really enjoyed this movie. I laughed and laughed. It held me intrigued and wasn't a chore to watch or follow the story line. This movie dared to do what many others don't - very un-PC in places. Good on them for making such a refreshing movie. Sure we've seen many elements of the story line before and could anticipate many of the outcomes but I don't think this detracted from it at all. Great to see so many well known actors in different roles too. And demonstrating their acting talent by creating believable Irish accents. I did wonder if Colin Farrell had to practice his mother tongue after being in the USA for so long - seems he did OK though. I would definitely watch this again and recommend it whole heartedly to others.,9.0,victoria-85,2006/07/15,37,29

311,Death of a Salesman,Greatest Play ever written,"Whether Lee J Cobb & Dunnock , or George C Scott, or in this case Hoffman , Reid, & Co., Arthur Miller's timeless classic, DEATH OF A SALESMAN, is the greatest literary work in American History...with Fitzgerald's Gatsby a close second despite similar themes. Miller's classics: All My Sons, The Price, Ride down Mt. Morgan, Incident at Vichy, After the Fall and the Crucible remain universal classics. Only Shakespeare was greater. In this production of Death of a Salesman, the cast shines including Malkovich & Reid - in a sad but powerful and poignant tale of broken hopes and dreams, values, priorities, and yes, even the illusion of the so-called ""American Dream"". Hoffman as Willy Loman is electrifying , passionate and right on! ""Attention must be paid"" to this production of Miller's classic.",10.0,mgoazul007,2006/01/01,1,1
312,Horrible Bosses 2,I wasn't a fan of the original 'HORRIBLE BOSSES' but I absolutely love this sequel!,"'HORRIBLE BOSSES 2': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Sequel to the 2011 hit comedy flick 'HORRIBLE BOSSES', which was about three friends who team together to try to murder their bosses. This time the buddies plot to kidnap the adult son of a rich businessman, who conned them out of their own business dreams. All of the main cast, of the original film, is back for this installment (except Colin Farrell, who's character died in the first movie); including Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikis, Charlie Day, Jennifer Aniston, Jamie Foxx, Kevin Spacey and Lindsay Sloane. They're joined this time around by Chris Pine and Christoph Waltz. It was directed by Sean Anders and written by Anders and John Morris (along with John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein). Anders and Morris are the same team that wrote other popular comedy flicks like 'SEX DRIVE' (which Anders also directed) and 'SHE'S OUT OF MY LEAGUE'; they also co-wrote 'HOT TUB TIME MACHINE', 'WE'RE THE MILLERS' and 'DUMB AND DUMBER TO' (I'm a big fan of theirs). I wasn't a fan of the original 'HORRIBLE BOSSES' but I absolutely love this sequel! Nick Hendricks (Bateman), Dale Arbus (Day), and Kurt Buckman (Sudeikis) have decided to start their own business together; instead of having to continue to answer to the horrible bosses of other companies. They've come up with a unique shower head invention, they call 'Shower Buddy', and think they've attracted the interest of a rich investor and his son, named Bert (Waltz) and Rex Hanson (Pine). Bert promises the trio that he'll buy 100,000 units from them but after they take out a $500,000 loan, and make the product, he backs out of the deal; he then plans to buy all their shower heads, at a discounted foreclosure price, to sell himself. In order to get their money back Nick, Dale and Kurt decide they're going to kidnap Rex and ask Bert for the $500.000, they lost, in ransom. Things, of course, don't go as they planned. I liked the idea of the original movie but just didn't find it to be that funny; I thought a lot of the jokes fell flat (despite an awesome cast) and didn't think it seemed very inspired (especially considering the great premise and great cast). This installment gets everything right that the first film got wrong. First of all it's hilarious, from beginning to end, thanks in large part to the directing of Anders and the clever writing team of Anders and Morris. The jokes rarely miss this time around and it's got a pretty clever caper storyline, and an awesome car chase climax, to boot! The film's success is also thanks largely to the outstanding cast, that seems like they're having a lot more fun this time; you can see it in the bloopers (in the end credits) and you can also just feel it in the movie (the whole way through). This is comedy done right; much better than the original! Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: [URL]",9.0,Hellmant,2014/12/03,80,40
313,Blackfish,A must see heavy-hitting indictment of the reality of Sea World,"""Blackfish"" is one of the greatest films to come along in a decade. The details and research of the never before seen reporting of what goes into making a massive intelligent whale perform tricks in a pool will forever change you. The film calls into question the very moral and ethical considerations of stripping away every normal and natural behavior to Orcas for our entertainment, and the devastating consequences of doing so for both people and the animals. Every person who is considering visiting Sea World or any Marine Park must see this film first. The shiny and fun show your kids might enjoy has a very dark and disturbing reality behind it. This movie marks the beginning of the end of keeping Orcas captive. It would be insanity to continue the confinement of Orcas for human entertainment now that the dirty secrets of Sea World have been made public. The animals do not matter to Sea World, only the profits. This movie causes great emotional pain as it exposes the worst traits of man. Blackfish is a must see film.",10.0,checkers38,2013/10/27,24,19
314,Spider-Man 2,The best superhero sequel ever made?,"In one of the best superhero sequels ever made, Tobey McGuire reprises his role as Peter Parker who is struggling with life's challenges, money, love and living and what's more he is losing his powers. And with more crime arising, Parker faces difficult choices concerning his personal life. Breaking the opening weekend Box Office record, the Spider-man franchise grew wider and this 2004 sequel has been described as one of the best superhero sequels ever made, and I couldn't agree more. With a much better opening to the first film, we are thrust straight into Parker's life as he tries to balance his job, his money and his university classes. Having many issues gives the film depth and is intriguing to watch each situation develop. This film is similar to the first, with a focus upon dramatic issues such as his love for Mary Jane and the loss of his Uncle Ben. There is a slight feeling of repetition but in context it is understandable and gives the characters more emotion and understanding. There is more action in this sequel, watch out for one of the best fantasy fight scenes in motion picture history, which so happens to be on a train. Excellent direction and nail biting close scenarios. There is always a question of realism but nevertheless that situation was simply outstanding. The effects are great, as you would expect and much better than the first. I'm personally not a big fan of CGI but regardless this was special and was made so by Raimi's direction. There are plenty of twists and turns in store and with the added action and more deep situations it makes the plot even more special. Though the love scenes are questionable they aren't as corny as the previous films and are enjoyable to watch. The green Goblin was a much better villain than Dr Octopus and J.K Simmons is brilliant as the newspaper boss and overall, Spiderman 2 is my favourite superhero film of all time.",9.0,Stampsfightclub,2008/04/20,3,3
315,Interstellar,Lame-o!,"Here's its 2 stars...I saw it in IMAX so I enjoyed going through the wormhole. Other than that? Well, let's get started... It's so typical - almost clichéd! - the way billions of dollars are spent on the visuals of movies these days and zero dinero on the script. Interstellar is a prime example of this. It just might be the definitive example. I'm not going to go into the science much because I'm a tad science- and space-illiterate but even I could see glaring holes in this tripe. For one thing, what kind of impossible tidal forces create a mile- high tidal wave out of 2 feet of water? Why weren't drones sent into the wormhole instead of people? That corn looked pretty green to me, didn't you think so? What's going on in London or Montreal or Buenos Aires or anywhere other than Kansas? Is Kansas the last place anyone is? Can't the black guy just once make it to the end of the movie? Why is NASA housed inside the Bonaventure Hotel? (okay sorry, I'm from LA and recognized it right away) Did Matt Damon owe someone a role and that's why he's in this tripe giving the worst performance of his career? Why weren't Matthew M's grandchildren and great grandchildren the slightest bit interested in him? Who the hell cast Matthew M in this? How was it possible to relay ""tapes from loved ones at home"" across those distances but nobody could relay anything back? What was up with that stupid robot? Okay, forgetting science and crazy-ass tesseracts for a moment...the human element of the script was incredibly eye-rolling. Remember that notoriously stupid moment in Armageddon when Liv Tyler screams ""That my father up there!""? Well the entire ""human"" aspect of this story and all the dialogue seemed to be written by whomever wrote that classic line. What was so wrong with treating the audience like intelligent people and giving then a straight, highly scientific, awe-at-the-majesty-of-the-universe, harsh reality sci-fi film that didn't insult you at every turn instead of this z-grade soap opera with neat-o visuals?",2.0,mowasteph,2014/11/18,253,115
316,Intermission,Black as a pint of Guinness,"There's something distinctly self-destructive about calling a film Intermission. Think about it: a list of films at the cinema, with the word ""Intermission"" half-way down. The certificate at the beginning  it could have the less clued-up popping out to the foyer for one of those funny hotdogs. It's not that the people who made this movie don't want you to see it  it's like they don't care if you see it. This is a savage film. It's set in present-day urban Dublin and I would describe it as Nil By Mouth meets Life Is Sweet. There is comedy here, but it's very, very black. Black as a black hole. With production companies including Brown Sauce (a theme in the film) and Company of Wolves, Intermission was made with the help of the Bord Scannán na hÉireann (Irish Film Board) and has everything that suggests: total reality, utter griminess and lots and lots of cuss-words. And almost all of the crew have Irish names not much Hollywood there, then. It's shot very tightly (almost claustrophobically), often with only people's heads in the frame. And most of the camera-work is hand-held. It's not a movie to see with a hangover. And, to be honest, it's not a movie to see if you've just come from Bible class. To say this film has shock value is like saying the Irish have a slight fondness for a pint of Guinness. I like my movies as real as possible, but I was taken aback by some of the pervasive violence in this picture. At the same time, thought, I was hugely impressed by its honesty. If I tell you that all of the main characters, at some stage, have either blood, cuts or bruising on their faces, you may see what I mean. It's basically a love story with John (Cillian Murphy) trying to win back Deidre (Kelly McDonald). But then the sociopathic nutter that is Lehiff (Colin Farrell) gets involved and it goes completely crazy. That's all you need to know really, except that Farrell is probably the best psycho I've seen since Robert Carlyle's Begby in Trainspotting. And he sings a fantastic Irish version of I Fought the Law for the closing credits.",,presumin_ed,2003/11/26,5,0
317,Taxi Driver,At a Glance: Taxi Driver,"Giving this movie more than just a quick look should be named a mistake already. Through all of things it covers such as the Political Campaign to Sport and his girls, are only a small thought in the true Character study of Travis (De Niro). Its not really a day in the life of someone who's crazy, but a life of hardship and loneliness that has been brought to this very point the viewer is witnessing. If you watch the movie for more than ten minutes or review and try to get a better understanding you'll notice different details about what the movie is actually trying to display. ** SPOILERS ** The movie starts off in New York City where we first see Travis applying to be a night shift cab driver. He claims to not be able to sleep at night and drives around. Through the movie we evaluate how lonesome and anti-social he is by how many times he fails to befriend or make conversations with others. Through messing up a relationship with a woman working at campaign office, and other faults such as a murderous man in his cab, a teen aged prostitute, and the ""Scum"" observed on the streets, Travis slides deeper into a disturbed mental state which causes him to become violent and stand up against what he's finds wrong through the film. He attempts to assassinate the presidential candidate through the movie that Betsy supports because like Sport (Harvey Keitel) to Iris (Jodie Foster), he is a man holding her back from being set free or being with him. **THE ENDING** If you've seen the movie you would be aware of the ending that almost donned the film an X rating. Iris is declared free and is sent back home to her family. (this is the only part of the ending we can actually call true) Ending 1: The Viewers misunderstood, but emotionally well ending. After the massacre Travis spends time healing in the hospital and is eventually released and named a Hero by the press. Iris's family give him thanks for rescuing her and being such a good person. Life returns to normal and he continues to drive his taxi, he picks up Betsy and a fare. Through confidence they speak and she is impressed by his actions, she asks how much and but he doesn't take her money. Travis is finally known and loved for protecting the girl and taking wrong doers off the streets. Accomplished. Driving off he views himself in the mirror, and a piercing noise dissuades his attention and his mirror gets moved trying to view something in the street. This ending could be called true by the possibility of a sequel in the works. Ending 2: The Satisfying and perfect character study ending. Through the film we watch Travis go from being a sort of normal guy just trying to get by, from the end he slips up and finds himself working between assassin and vigilante. We watch him kill the people holding Iris from living what would be a normal life, and see him being wounded in the process. As the police come in Travis his fingers to his head like a gun and you see when his head tilts back his eyes roll back. In film thats dignified as a characters death. Directly after the scene, we notice Travis's life has improved and he has been renown as a hero by the press, thanked by Iris's family, a good guy, and also confident to the woman he's been trying to get the entire movie. Travis finally has the satisfaction he's been looking for the whole time, but doesn't it seem like its happening rapidly together? In the film you have watched Travis's persona changing along with the character analysis. Knowing his goals the entire time you finally get to see them flourish, after the tone of the film changes entirely. To the Point where Travis tilts his head back, to where he adjusts his mirrors, your seeing his fantasy and fulfillment he was always wishing for. To be seen and noticed, as a hero or maybe even less. Travis is finding satisfaction in what isn't actually true, as his last dying thoughts. He doesn't notice something in the rear view mirror with a sharp noise, he vanishes from his sight because he isn't truly there. His life has ended and his fantasy has finished along with the film. As the movie is a character study for insanity this ending would be perfect because you see him from his good descent to a vigilante to his last dying thoughts of love and being noticed he dreamed of. It makes the movie beautiful and worth all of the hype just to see, his character as detailed and deformed as it is. I can watch it over and over and notice something else every time. The ending is haunting every time, no matter how you think about it because it leaves you with a 'what just happened'? If it means a sequel to find out what happened with fiction or reality, life or death for Travis. I Think i would rather keep the mystery",10.0,johnXny,2011/02/22,11,6
318,The Wailing,All that wailing without a payoff,"To call The Wailing tonally inconsistent is an understatement. This film is a big fail on two levels: first it needs some serious chopping in the editing room. At least 30 minutes of tedious shamanistic drum beating and moronic cop antics could have been left on the cutting room floor, and the movie would have been better because of it. Second, the plot makes no sense either way you look at it. We are given two potential culprits behind the mayhem in the village resulting in zombie-like symptoms in the ""infected"" citizens. Two possible antagonists, and by the end, we still are left with two possibilities. But neither one makes much sense, in the context of the film's narrative. If mood was everything in assessing a horror film's quality, The Wailing receives a B+ in that category - when the scenes don't include the Keystone Cops crying like little girls, or long closeups of people paralyzed with fear, staring in horror at bloody carnage. But making viewers endure 2 1/2 hours of suspenseful buildup without providing a sufficient climactic payoff is unforgivable. No amount of style can make up for the egregious lack of substance in this film. For top notch horror, rewatch The Ring or The Orphanage or Audition. The Wailing will have you wailing for your 2 1/2 hours back.",4.0,giallopudding,2019/11/25,12,7
319,Detachment,a powerful and moving tale of a substitute teacher and the intersecting lives in a high school,"Tony Kaye is not known for having happy-go-lucky tales that leave you feeling better about the status of our world. Even in light and glorious colored shots, Kaye tells stories with deeper inner conflict and demanding commentary about our society. His most famous work, ""American History X"" (a project that he famously wanted his name taken off of after being upset by edits star Edward Norton made to the film), was a film that showed these dark struggles and issues in a film about a neo- nazi group and their attitude towards the world. In his new film, ""Detachment"" (a film he has kept his name on), Kaye and first time writer Carl Lund tell the story of a substitute teacher who travels from school to school trying his best to help the lives of his students, his own life, and the community he is in. The substitute is Henry Barthes, played by Adrien Brody, who is a man that has his own inner struggles and past conflicts that he fights with day-to-day. But Henry must try to put these issues aside when he enters the classroom at this school; a school at which the students don't care, the teachers struggle to educate, and everyone takes a toll from the experiences. What Lund does so brilliantly in his writing is creating a story that doesn't give one perspective of the situation. He tells the story through the eyes of Henry, the students, the parents, and even a young prostitute Henry befriends. In fact, even as Henry is the main character of this story, we still get perspective from many of the other teachers (played by James Caan, Tim Blake Nelson, Christina Hendricks, Blythe Danner, Lucy Liu, and Marcia Gay Harden). The student stories range from a young girl who struggles with weight problems, parents pressuring her, and bullying to students who act tough and thug and threaten harm to the teachers. What results from this is a multi-faceted story that gives many perspectives and tales. Like ""The Wire"" inside a high school. As the tale moves along, we get to know each of these characters deeply and care for them a great deal. From the relationship that forms between Henry and the young prostitute named Erica to the conversations between teachers discussing how they could be better, the film places us within this harsh world of a school and asks us what can be done about bettering our youth, bettering our communities, and bettering ourselves. The film also touches briefly and comments on the outside factors that affect day-to-day school life. From advertisements and social norms telling us how we should act and who we should be to apathetic parenting that leads to a Parent Night with almost no attendees, Kaye and Lund construct a film that demands us to want more, shows us some of the factors that lead to these problems, and confesses there are no easy answers. As Henry begs his students to think for themselves and care for something more than just them, Kaye and Lund bring in the outer conflicts that impact these kids and cause the inability for them to think this way. This is no easy road with a simple answer. It is complex with many different intersecting avenues. Outside of the strong construction of the story by Lund and the beautiful cinematography and strong directing from Kaye, this film also benefits deeply from the acting performances, specifically from Adrien Brody. While Caan, Nelson, Hendricks, Danner, Liu, Harden, and newcomers Sami Gayle (Erica) and Tony's daughter Betty Kaye (the bullied Meredith) are all brilliant, Brody is absolutely enthralling. While Brody's career has not blown up since his Best Actor Oscar for ""The Pianist"" (a few Wes Anderson films, ""The Brothers Bloom,"" ""King Kong,"" ""The Village,"" ""Hollywoodland,"" and ""Splice"" on the short and not extremely noteworthy list), he is so powerful and strong in ""Detachment."" With the ability to say so much with so little and controlling every scene he is in, Brody reminds us why he is an Academy Award winner while making us laugh and cry with him throughout this film. ""Detachment"" is an extremely effective and emotional tale that will both warm and break your heart. The story lines of the film intersect and converge like a graceful car crash. The pain of one interaction morphs into the joy of a different one. Haunting memories of the past bring up pain in the present. With careful construction of the world of this school, along with Kaye's masterful direction and photography and some brilliant thespianism by Brody and the rest of the cast, ""Detachment"" is a film that can impact a person in so many ways. Just as Henry tries to have an influence on all the lives he meets in the short period he substitutes, so does Kaye educate and ask questions to his audience and demand that we think a little more about ourselves, those around us, and the community we are all a part of. That we must not stay detached, but become an important and productive member for ourselves and everyone around us.

320,The Chorus,Magical,"Spoilers Taking France by storm this summer, Les choristes purportedly led to a surge in applications to join choirs all over the country. The magic is unquestionably in the music, but I'll come to that later. The success of Les choristes as a film (with or without the divine music) lies in its not trying to be anything more than what it is, a simple tale that opens up to you instead of manipulating you. You'll find neither heart-breaking poignancy nor rousing heroism. Within the short duration of a school term or two he spent with the somewhat notorious boarding school, teacher and musician Clement Mathieu had his modest ambition fulfilled, of having a choir sing the music he wrote, then moved along to a continuously modest life of teaching and music. Talented protégé Pierre Morhange did achieve fame and success, but we have essentially been spared laboured scenes of Titanic struggles or exuberant jubilation. To ensure that I'm not misleading towards the other extreme, let me hasten to add that Les choristes does touch our hearts. It does this gently, sensibly. But in the end, it's the music. Purely the celestial beauty of the music alone will brings tears to the appreciative audiences' eyes. The story is touching. The character are likable. But the ultimate magic is the choir and boy soprano Jean-Baptiste Maunier chosen from two thousand auditions. Such a magical choice.",,harry_tk_yung,2004/09/16,133,118
321,Horrible Bosses 2,"the first picture did relatively well, so why not make another?Well, actually, there are many good reasons not to. All of which are highlighted across 108 painful minutes.","Horrible Bosses was alright. Nothing special, but easy to indulge in, harmless fun that did its job effectively. It had a playful, entertaining premise which was executed sufficiently and left the viewer feeling somewhat fulfilled. But do we need a sequel that follows an identical formula, with an abundance of the same, rehashed jokes? Of course we don't. This distinctively superfluous, and evidently lazy production is the product of an industry that just follows the money. The first picture did relatively well, so why not make another? Well, actually, there are many good reasons not to. All of which are highlighted across 108 painful minutes. While Seth Gordon passes directing duties over to Sean Anders, the cast remains mostly the same, as we catch up with Nick (Jason Bateman), Kurt (Jason Sudeikis) and Dale (Charlie Day), who have become entrepreneurs and started their own business. Thinking they've struck gold when Bert Hanson (Christoph Waltz) agrees to sell their product, it turns out their ineptitude and naivety presented the ruthless businessman a chance to screw them over. So, in a bid to seek revenge and save their company from going under, they decide to kidnap his erratic, and conceited son, Rex (Chris Pine). Partly why this sequel doesn't work – is because our three protagonists are all so imbecilic, it goes beyond the point of being endearing. In the first endeavour, their bosses, who consisted of Kevin Spacey and Jennifer Aniston (who both make cameo appearances in this picture, too) were nasty, pantomime villains, and we got the sense our three relatable, regular guys in the middle, were pushed to the limit thanks to a loathsome employer, and many people could resonate with that sentiment, albeit overstated in this instance. However now they're just being ridiculous, and we can't identify with them in the same way we once did. They agreed to a huge, million pound deal without signing anything. If anything they should be kidnapped on grounds of stupidity. It also doesn't help that Kurt is just becoming a sexual deviant who needs help, while the tone for many of this production's jokes is somewhat questionable. There's one sequence where Aniston's Julia Harris fantasises over a rather graphic retelling of a sexual encounter between two teenage boys. It's just wrong – and more importantly, not funny. Offensive jokes can be excused when they actually manage to provoke laughter from the audience. But in this picture, laughter becomes something of a side note. That being said, Bateman's Nick is persistently the most well-crafted creation. He represents 'normality' and yet he's equally as messed up as the other two. It's an effective, tried and tested comedy trope. Be if Father Ted to Dougal, or Oliver Hardy to Stan Laurel – they give off the impression they're in control of a situation, and yet they never are. It's not enough to save this production however, while if one more filmmaker uses that 'effin How You Like Me Now? song over the top of a montage, expect to wake up to the news headline of 'film critic throws himself through cinema screen'. Yet that's not the biggest sin committed by this director, as we're treated to a contrived, unfunny set of outtakes during the closing credits, in a last ditch, desperate attempt to generate some cheap laughter from the crowd. At least we can see how much fun they had making the film, it's just a shame the same can't be said for those of us watching.",1.0,owenpearce2011,2015/01/01,14,7

323,The Chorus,"An improvement on ""la cage aux rossignols""?","""La cage aux rossignols"" ,released in 1945,was one of the last movies of the occupation days .""Les choristes"" ,although they have transposed the action to the fifties,hints at it when a young brat breaks into ""maréchal ,nous voilà!"" ,anthem of those dark years.The question is:was it necessary to redo?Yes the songs are splendid and are likely to become part of the repertoire of all the French schools .Yes the boy who plays Morange mesmerizes the audience ,and like Brigitte Fossey (""jeux interdits"" ) or Benoit Magimel (""la vie est un long fleuve tranquille"" ) he may become an actor when he grows up. The original screenplay has undergone some changes:it has become a long flashback ,with an ending which focuses one more time on success and fame ,borrowing more from ""Professor Holland's opus"" than from Dreville's old flick.The rebel pupil's sister has become an unmarried mother,which was unthinkable in the Petain years.Producer Jacques Perrin -who has seen better days,artistically speaking- appears as the umpteenth version of the ugly duckling turned into a swan. And finally the Jugnot vehicle has the same drawbacks as its model:the kids become quickly much too quickly a heavenly choir ,andwe do know that, in both movies ,the young actors are choristers in real life.The characters remain cardboard and Gérard Jugnot is neither better nor worse than Noël-Noël . What's amazing is that generally ""la cage aux rossignols"" is dismissed as cheesy and maudlin (its rating is average) whereas its remake is praised to the skies.It's the same old song though.",4.0,dbdumonteil,2005/07/05,18,6
324,Taxi Driver,A difficult film to review...,"What can you say about ""Taxi Driver"" that hasn't been said already? It's phenomenal. I'm not a fan of Scorsese's other directorial efforts, really--nor am I a big DeNiro fan--but everything about this film is absolutely, unquestionably RIGHT. So many people seem to be confused when they watch this movie: they either root for Travis Bickle when he finally loses his marbles, or they feel that ""Taxi Driver"" tries to justify racism and misogyny. I don't think there's any need to go to such extremes. Yes, there are elements of racism and misogyny here, but the film doesn't promote those attitudes. And as for Travis being the nominal ""hero"" of the film, I don't believe that this was Paul Schrader's intention, either. There ARE no heroes; ultimately, this is just the very grim story of a marginalized man who loses what little control he had to begin with. This is why ""Taxi Driver"" appeals to people, I believe, but it's also why the film is routinely misinterpreted. As Schrader has said, this is a film about alienation. ""Taxi Driver"" tells an interesting, engaging human story and that's what makes it great--not the social commentary, or what's viewed as such.",10.0,InjunNose,2004/07/09,11,6
325,Primal Fear,Highly entertaining and well acted court drama,"Primal fear benefits first and foremost from rock solid performances by all involved. Richard Gere is cool and confident as defense attorney Martin Vail, and brings a lot of charm with his performance. Laura Linney portrays Janet Venable, the cold prosecutor that was once romantically involved with Vail, and this sparks competitive chemistry between the two. Edward Norton's Aaron is unquestionably the standout here. All of his little quirks make for a very curious alleged murderer; he is a very effective character. The plot is clear and easy to follow, aided by concise dialogue. The film doesn't rely on a complex story, it instead chooses to rivet you as Vail tries to dig deeper into a case that seems like a foregone conclusion. The film is primarily a court drama, but it finds time to delve into darker territory in moments. The ending is the big payoff it wants to be, though I wont get into detail because tension is built masterfully up until all is said and done, and when the credits are rolling you will be very satisfied. This is a must-see.",9.0,nukfan,2013/11/26,2,2
326,October Sky,Heartwarming and inspiring blast off from the 1950's,"My son, now a college science freshman, has been fascinated with space exploration for over a decade now and always dreamed of watching a blast off from Cape Kennedy. He now views NASA's space program a little more realistically and perhaps not quite as positively, but this film was a true inspiration to him and a great hit with our entire family. It tells the true story of a West Virginia coal miner's son, Homer Hickam, who dreams of rocketry after seeing the USSR's Sputnik lighting up the October sky...very dramatic scene here, truly conveying his awe and wonder at the spectacle. To the consternation of his mining dad (who disapproves) but encouragement of his science teacher, Miss Riley, Homer puts his dreams into practice as he, the school nerd, and a couple of pals experience a series of failures and successes (mainly failures) in their trial and error rocket building attempts. Will Homer succeed in time for the county science fair and win the much needed scholarship awarded as prize? I won't give the ending away, but this film is a tribute to dreaming big dreams, pursuing those dreams despite obstacles and opposition, and especially persevering. It should serve as both an inspiration to all young people, whatever form their dreams may take, as well as a tribute to man's ongoing curiosity about our galaxy and methods for space exploration. The characters are well drawn, especially the interactions between Homer and his father, who finds himself in conflict with the son he loves, having planned for him a traditional coal mining career. In light of the recent West Virginia mining disasters, the dangers inherent in that particular career choice have been sadly brought to the forefront of public attention in a way much less meaningful to me when I first viewed this movie. As for the love interest to which other reviewers have made reference, it must indeed be a sub-plot as I have absolutely no recollection of it now. Obviously not crucial to the main drama, though the whole movie had a real and rather refreshing nostalgic, old fashioned 50's feel to it. It made me wish I was raising my child back in that era. Wonderful heart warming and uplifting tale that will surely put a lump in your throat and encourage you in your own way to reach for the stars.",9.0,roghache,2006/03/09,4,3
327,Blackfish,This is one of the movies that keep cycling around your mind,"After watching Mountain Patrol, Dominion, this is another rare and breathtaking movie that can be put in the same level and reputation as them. A good documentary is not only about showing the truth most people didn't know, but more about the gravity it leads to the good/ better thoughts from a right angle. Blackfish can be counted as an astonishing movie influencing people with the positive attitude. I feel ashamed, though I never experienced working/ hunting for wild animals, about the human-centric society and environment built upon the thousand-of-trillion earth. I always wonder if there is a better plan for rebuilding and reformatting all the aquariums/ zoos, instead of putting the slogan/""reason"" that mainly protect the endangered animals.

From the story of two hit-man on a job, to a fixed boxing match to a date between a hit-man and the wife of a mob boss. There was definitely a lot of care into the writing of the script, as everything no matter the order it is in, fits with the story. Many mysteries have been left such as what is inside of the briefcase and why Marcellus Wallace has a band-aid on the back of his neck, which may be connected.

330,Interstellar,'Interstellar',"'Interstellar' was incredible. The visuals, the score, the acting, were all amazing. The plot is definitely one of the most original I've seen in a while. Most of the critic reviews have said that some bits are a little too unbelievable, but I have to disagree. Yes, there were some parts that were definitely in the ""fi"" part of sci-fi. But the thing is, 'Interstellar' deals with concepts that we know very little about. We have no idea what the 4th or 5th dimension is like, or what it would be like to go through a wormhole or a black hole. I don't think it's fair to call something unbelievable, when we have absolutely no idea what WOULD be believable in those circumstances. Either way, excellent writing from the Nolan brothers. The visuals were outstanding, and will no doubt be nominated for an Oscar. The performances were excellent, though nothing Oscar worthy, as is the case with most of Nolan's films ('The Dark Knight' being the obvious exception). Hans Zimmer's score was amazing and blended perfectly with the film. All in all, 'Interstellar' is an excellent movie, which I personally think is Nolan's most beautiful film to date.",10.0,millert1409,2014/11/05,1650,1103

This is the best Sci-Fi movie of all time and my personal all time runner up (it loses to Saving Private Ryan, but that movie is unbeatable). Clint Mansell as always delivers a suspenseful score that makes you wish he worked on more films. Duncan Jones is a wonderful director, but he shined more so in the story he crafted and dialog he created. Last, but not least Sam Rockwell delivers an unrivalled performance all actors should stride for.

333,Moon,Questions to ponder.,"Science fiction is invariably a fairy tale nowadays. You can probably connect with a handful of movies showing a fictional future. Most just serve to entertain with cheap visual thrills. Moon is an exception to this degradation of scientific imagination in our modern day script writing. Instead of pondering over the power levels of imaginary ""cores"" and flashy laser weaponry, this movie strives to ask difficult questions from the audience. Questions that will leave you with no clear answers long after you have seen, dissected and digested the movie. Script is remarkably simple and there are no ""big"" secrets except one, which is revealed around the middle. The rest of the story is what gets the gray cells all juiced up. Instead of delivering a complicated plot, the movie delivers a complicated premise. Soundtrack is excellently suited to the pace and texture of the story telling. Visuals are clean and precise, and most importantly believable - without being boring. The dialogs are also well - real ! No flamboyance or theater grade facial mannerisms here. Just plane and simple acting, done in a most convincing manner. Rockwell is a gem. A well laid out story which tries to tickle our moral brain maps, this movie is a must watch for hard science fiction fans.",10.0,mr-surajit-ray,2011/04/10,13,6
334,Ferris Bueller's Day Off,Would rather have gone to school,"It's hard to believe that John Hughes filmed this back-to-back with ""The Breakfast Club"". Ferris Bueller is a smooth operator who is something of a transgressive figurehead at his high school for his rebellious nature. Throughout ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" he breaks the fourth wall and addresses the viewer, letting them in on his schemes and tricks of the trade. On this day, he shows us how he fools his parents into thinking he is too sick to attend school, making it his nine sick-day this semester. His parents molly-coddle him and then head off to work, leaving him in bed. His miserable-faced sister (Jennifer Grey) sees right through his antics and loathes him for it. Another person who can not stand Ferris is the highly-strung school principal played by Jeffrey Jones (His performance being the only good thing about the film for me). He makes it his mission to find Ferris out and show him for the truant that he is. But Ferris has other ideas for his 'day off off' (They are actually highly unimpressive and uninteresting) and these involve his girlfriend and best friend Cameron. I usually don't mind Matthew Broderick but he creates one of the most irritating characters in movie history here. Bueller is sarcastic and very arrogant, and is not at all funny. Unfortunately, he never gets what's coming to him.",3.0,Coffee_in_the_Clink,2020/04/05,4,3

The story is average, the love story totally un-necessary, Richard Gere is average, the ending is expected, and you don't get to know the motive for the murder. However, one thing is *great* in this movie. I am of course talking about Edward Norton's acting. Norton is truly brilliant in his role as a confused young man, and I have seen this movie more than one time only because of Norton. He makes it worth it to sit through the tedious flirtation between Gere and his love interest. Norton makes this a movie a bit over average, and he really is brilliant!",7.0,AKS-6,1999/03/24,37,21

337,Ferris Bueller's Day Off,"An interesting and stylish take on the years of then-contemporary American teenagers, that carries on finding new audiences due to its study of individualism.","Like Back to the Future, Ferris Bueller's Day Off seems to hold a pretty firm and entrenched place in whatever 1980s teen cannon that people hold in such high regard. Back to the Future was, perhaps famously, rejected by many-a studios on the basis of 'not being raunchy enough'; something other films of its ilk were at the time. I can imagine something similar happening to Ferris Bueller's Day Off, but like Back to the Future, it is the decidedly 'un-raunchy' films of the era that we now revisit the most often and just seem to hold in higher regard. I think what keeps this film resonating with past and current audiences alike is its clear distinction in paying close attention to young people, and their ever-ongoing battle for independence, for recognition and for individuality. The lead is Ferris Bueller (Broderick); a young and very confident, almost borderline sociopathic in his behaviour, male in then-contemporary America. Ferris is the sort of guy who can con his way into an expensive restaurant; hack his way into the school computer mainframe and shows total disregard to his friend's and certain respective situations when trying to haggle the use of a rare and classic car for the day. The film takes special care in introducing him as an individual whom lives in a large, detached house in a rich neighbourhood that comes complete with a white picket fence. He is literate in all the latest gadgets and pieces of technology, be it home computers used to hack or stereo systems to further the notion he is unwell. In direct opposition to Ferris is the principal of Ferris' school, named Ed Rooney (Jones). Rooney isn't just out to capture Bueller as he plays truant, he is out to destroy Bueller's life; this, Rooney outlines as his goal very early on in the piece. This seems to be the essence of what keeps audiences old and new consistently discovering the film; that study of 'old vs. young' as these cocky, smart and quite attractive bunch of confident oddball kids dare stand up to those of a high authority; those that are grey, suit-clad authoritarian figures such as Rooney. But I think Bueller is smarter-still than what he lets on. He talks very early on about how important it is to go to college and learn a trade and live the American Dream, but he does so in a very nonchalant manner, almost as if he is repeating what it is he's told to say, or think, or feel. What follows is a chain of events and total disregard to most things that suggest he isn't of this ideation at all. But the journey does have an ideation; an ideation Bueller himself cooks up to do with being able to notice life and enjoy life as best you can, otherwise it might seem like it's passing you by. But the film isn't preoccupied with just these studies. Its attention to young vs. old or independence vs. routine is similarly played about with through one of Bueller's two friends named Cameron Frye (Ruck), who is given a slight subplot to do with being able to stand up to his father. Ferris and Cameron's third friend is Sloane Peterson (Sara), Ferris' girlfriend. The three complete an unusual triangle of pals; they are one another's' friend as well as foil, forever getting into adventures and situations but hitting the odd wall when it comes to the finer things during the day out. Cameron is forever concerned with the car; Cameron and Sloane are forever worried they might get caught (particularly when Ferris partakes in a large musical number in the street) and Ferris seems forever pre-occupied that the three of them will not get the best out of their day off; a day off Ferris sees as a gift, as something they worked hard towards earning with their scheming, and thus; must embrace it as fully as possible. The film is a love story, a comedy that relies on slapstick, situation and screwball alike; the film is an odd beast of basic convention, surrealist humour and truancy glorification. But does it ever focus too much on one thing? Does it particularly care what you might think of it? I don't think it does, it just throws mostly everything at the screen, stirs it all up and allows it all to play out. It feels like two, or possibly three, different films at once – but that's fine because there is enough different sorts of content all brewing at once, and focused on at a balanced rate, that we go with it. One might say the film's attitude echoes that of its lead; it's doing things its own way, in its own style and doesn't particularly mind how you react. It's the kind of film that can go from a slow motion shot of two guys driving a sort-of stolen car that was sort-of stolen in the first place to the Star Wars theme; to a series of scenes that rely on a school teacher falling over a few times as a source of humour. The best thing about it all, is that it's all actually rather effective.",7.0,johnnyboyz,2009/06/11,30,21
338,Ferris Bueller's Day Off,Another famous 1980s Chicago teen comedy,"""Ferris Bueller's day off"" is another of the many 1980s teen comedies (many of them John Hughs) set in the Chicago suburbs. Ferris's famous talking into the camera was one of several things which made this movie iconic, his ""life moves by fast"" philosophy and a Ferrari taking an important role in the film. Alan Ruck's nervous Cameron, the son of the cold uptight Farrari's owner, and his need to loosen up and join the hero on his infamous day off, was the movie's next iconic element. Jeffrey Jones's most famous movie role, Edward Rooney and his ""throw all my other priorities to the side until I deal with my no. 1 priority Ferris Bueller"" principal role was the next iconic landmark. Ferris's fooled parents, his not so fooled and resentful (Dirty dancing to-be-star at the time) sister, and the humorous gimmicks (like the snoring sound effects radio and dummy in the bed tied to a string to the door to make it look like Ferris is turning in bed sleeping whenever someone peeks into the room). Then, the phone calls including Ferris talking to one of his many friends in school (the coughing synthesizer) about his made-up illness, their funny comments (""Ferris is gonna get me out of summer school, I hope he doesn't die, I'd hate to go to summer school""), his calling Cameron to get him out of his bed of self pity (and his bed) and over to him, and Ferris somehow fixing the computer in Rooney's office from his own computer (Ferris: ""I asked for a car and I got a computer, how's that for being born under a bad sign?"") which lessened the stated amount of days he's missed while Rooney's on the phone telling Mrs. Bueller (Rooney: ""nine times""). Then the call from Cameron disguised as Sloan's dad telling Rooney about her alleged grandmother's passing to get Sloan (Ferris's GF) out of school to join them. Then Sloan outside the school doors with Rooney (calling him a beautiful man, lol) waiting for ""her dad"" (Ferris) while we can hear teacher Ben Stein's ""anyone? anyone?"" from a nearby window, a funny follow-up from the famous funny classroom scene with Stiein's ""anyone? anyone?"", ""Bueller. Bueller. Bueller."", and the student's response ""I heard from my boyfriend's sister's neighbor's girlfriend's best friend's cousin's sister's friend (or something) that they saw Ferris pass out at 31 Flavors last night"". That comment, the earlier phonecall scene, people in numerous different places throughout the movie asking about Ferris (including the police station), a ""Save Ferris"" sign on a watertower, and Rooney's secretary's famous comment about his popularity (""dweebs, geeks, sportos, motorheads, etc., they adore him, they think he's a righteous dude""), they were all several examples of Ferris's popularity and how almost everybody was fooled by his ""illness"" except his skeptical sister and Rooney, who's treck off school grounds to confront him was another iconic gimmick of the movie (along with Rooney's numerous funny hijinks while seeking him such as getting muddy, and him and the dog that doesn't like him). The above isn't even the half of it yet, there's still all of the famous and hilarious hijinks of Ferris, Cameron, and Sloan in Chicago, the different landmarks they visit; the Sears tower, stock exchange, art gallery (and Cameron's strange fascination with the little girl in the ""Sunday afternoon"" painting), a couple of innings at the Cubs game (with Rooney watching the same game from a pizza parlor (and him asking the owner the score, the owner responding: ""nothing, nothing"", Rooney: ""who's winning?"", Owner: ""the Bears"" lol), and then him mistaking a girl for Ferris and getting her drink spit on him, lol), and then Ferris/Cameron/Sloan eating at a fancy restaurant with a near miss with seeing Mr Bueller (Ferris: ""1000 restaurants in this city and I pick the one my dad goes to"") and the comical confrontation with the weird restaurant owner when trying to get in (Ferris posing as the Sausage king of Chicago) and the owner not buying it until Cameron uses his same funny disguised voice from earlier with Rooney, this time as police officer on the phone, to convince the owner to believe Ferris is the Sausage king of Chicago. There are still numerous funny classic things from this iconic movie I haven't mentioned, because there just isn't enough room here. There's still Cameron's freakout over the sleazy professional (Cameron: ""professional what?"") taking his dad's Ferrari on a joyride throughout the city adding 150 extra miles to the car. But Ferris's biggest motive, besides having his fun filled day, was getting Cameron to learn to not get his self-esteem lowered by and to stop being scared of his super-strict ""I love my car much more than my son"" dad. Because of how this movie went, and because Camerons dad was an unseen but talked about character in this movie, it's probably best that it was left to our imagination on what Cameron's dad's reaction was gonna be to his car not only having 150 extra miles on it, but it now being smashed on the ground after running through the window of Cameron's museum style display room of his house (sort of a connection to a comment earlier by Ferris: ""Cameron's house is like a museum, it's very big, very cold, and you're not allowed to touch anything"").",8.0,spenrh,2019/04/28,1,1
339,Moon,Oscar worthy performance and film...,"Shot in just 33 days for a paltry $5 million by first time director Duncan Jones, MOON is as much of a breakthrough for this unknown director as DISTRICT 9 was for (relatively new) Neill Blomkamp. Yes, it's THAT good. Clocking in at only 97 minutes, the film also gives a sense of urgency to a situation that easily could have been snooze inducing. Instead, Moon will have you on the edge of your proverbial couch, cheering on its main protagonist(s) and asking tough questions about big business, genetic research, and what it means to be human. Sam Rockwell (FROST/NIXON) is in almost every frame and pulls in an Oscar caliber performance (although I doubt he'll get nominated since this isn't a big budget flick and hit only a limited number of theaters before going to DVD). Rockwell plays Sam Bell, a lonely man. In fact, he is the only man at a moon-base that collects Helium-3, a valuable energy commodity that gets shot back to Earth. Sam's only companion is a Hal-9000-ish machine called Gerty (voiced by Kevin Spacey, RECOUNT) who's sole job is to protect Sam. But not for long, because Sam's three year contract at the lunar base is coming to a close and he's ready to return to his beautiful wife and daughter back home. But an accident injures Sam and he awakens in the infirmary with Gerty caring for him. Memory gaps and surprisingly good physical condition (after such a bad accident) allows Sam to get back to work quickly. But he soon discovers a stranger trapped in a vehicle, and this stranger looks a lot like Sam. As the two Sam's fight, argue and eventually gain an understanding of what they are, a terrible realization hits them both. It is a poignant, graphic and horrible moment that will have many a hair standing up on peoples' necks when they see what has happened and what lengths a corporation is willing to go to in order to minimize expenses. The time spans are fascinating and leave much open for discussion. How long can one truly last living alone on the moon? How much radiation exposure would you get? And how long, genetically, was Sam designed to last? None of the answers are readily available, but most viewers will be asking themselves these things long after the movie has finished running its final credits. Congratulations must be given to director Duncan Jones for chasing after Sam Rockwell to do this role; he was, no doubt, the absolute perfect person to do it. Also, the miniature moon-scape scenes were phenomenal and never looked cheap or forced, as did the lunar station. The music was the perfect mix of creepiness and forlorn so that you really don't know how to feel about Sam and his predicament at the end. Empathy is there for sure, but what good it does is anyone's guess. Looking for a great independent film that you won't soon forget? Shoot for the Moon.",10.0,fwomp,2010/01/29,10,5

341,Moon,A great Sci-Fi movie,"The Moon has always been a source of wonder and mystery. It is so far away, yet much closer than the stars. Man has reached the Moon, but there is still so much that is unknown about it. It is a bridge between mystery and fact, and director Duncan Jones uses it as a brilliant setting for his science fiction film Moon. The movie stars Sam Rockwell as a lunar astronaut also named Sam stationed alone on the Moon for three years. He isn't entirely alone, because the AI computer GERTY (Kevin Spacey) is constantly following him. Energy companies have discovered vast amounts of Helium on the Moon, and they now mine that Helium in order to power the Earth. As Sam begins his last two weeks stationed in the mining facility, his mind begins to break down and he soon realizes he just might not be able to make it back. It is quite obvious that the main intention of Moon was to pay respect to the older science fiction movies like Alien and 2001: A Space Odyssey, and it is a great homage to the genre indeed. GERTY is possibly one of my favorite AI computers ever in a movie, because it constantly shows its mood through a series of different smiley faces, and has Kevin Spacey's voice. The overall story of Moon is pretty good, and it definitely tugs a bit on your emotions because the main character Sam is so real and relatable. It is a bit more of an art film, but I have found that the mixture of art and Sci-Fi is a brilliant combination. The absolute key ingredient to making Moon was finding a capable actor because it is essentially a one man show, and they picked a winner with Sam Rockwell. Rockwell gives one of his best performances to date, and while it might be a little early to predict I can see him getting an Oscar nomination for his role. The other great thing about this picture is the special effects. Since the budget was so low this could have been a disaster, but the shots of the Moon Rovers and Harvesters were astonishingly realistic, and a typical movie goer would think this had at least a 40 million dollar budget. It is amazing how much more was accomplished with this tiny budget compared to the $200 million dollars poured into Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. Overall Moon is a complete film. It isn't groundbreaking, but it accomplished everything it set out to be, which are a great homage and a chance for Sam Rockwell to really show his acting prowess. I found myself leaving the theater with a great feeling of satisfaction that I have only received from a couple movies this year so far. 9/10",9.0,hrstar24,2009/07/16,286,242

343,Goodfellas,My favourite of all gangster flicks,"Goodfellas by director Martin Scorsese is by far my most favourite gangster movie of all times. It's one of those movies that, despite its runtime of over 2 hours, I can watch again and again without ever getting bored at any time. What it clearly sets it above other masterpieces of this genre like 'The Godfather' is that every scene gives me something. While many other movies of its kind tend to have scenes that get a bit tiresome or just aren't that interesting or entertaining, 'Goodfellas' succeeds to deliver top-notch entertainment until the end. This is, of course, thanks to the extremely well written script and to the perfect cast. Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro who play the main characters give so good performances, that I could not think of any other actor to play any of those roles and the rest of the cast is equally good. The movie has a perfect pacing which is also thanks to the narration of Henry Hill alias Ray Liotta. His voice accompanies us through the whole movie and is definitely a huge fun factor. He delivers his story so well that you virtually live through this movie with him. When he describes how he got into the organization and what it's like to be a wiseguy, you really comprehend and feel it. Then there are the technical aspects of the movie. The camera work is brilliant with very long tracking shots and scenes without a cut which take you as an invisible spectator along through the scenes. And last but not least there's the music. Scorsese makes use of well-known pop music of that time, which really adds to the atmosphere as a whole. In the end, 'Goodfellas' is my favourite Scorsese and gangster movie as well. There are very few movies (of that length and scope) that manage to deliver such a constant and high entertainment value from start to finish, but this is one that does.",10.0,luisk1989,2012/07/05,14,9
344,The Chorus,"Formulaic, but at least it's in French!","Les Choristes, (2004) Directed by Christophe Barratier, follows a set formula: A new teacher arrives at a school for delinquent and orphaned children, and tries to soften their lives by creating a chorus. The headmaster is cruel, the old gardener is kindly, and the boys range from gentle and decent to hard and violent. However, all of the boys respond to music, and their lives are changed because of the efforts of the new teacher. The acting is good, and the effort is sincere. I live in Upstate New York--we don't see many French-language films here, so we enjoy the ones we see.",8.0,Red-125,2005/02/26,0,0
345,October Sky,a hero's quest,"The story told by this movie would seem romanticized, if not for the fact that it is closely based on the truth. The film is surprisingly true to the book, down to the details of Miss Riley's illness and subsequent death. Homer Hickam and his friends really did escape the coal mine to pursue their dreams. They suffered setbacks, took many detours, and endured the scorn of their peers. In the end, they prevailed. The hero's quest is often a lonely one, but can end in success. The film portrays both the adversity and the triumph well. In reading some other reviews, I was saddened to see that people have become so cynical that they cannot imagine that the events happened as they were depicted, that the story was embellished with corny Hollywood cliches. To those individuals, I recommend the book.",8.0,drlorentz,2003/12/28,1,1
346,The Green Mile,More than Meets the Eye--Don't Miss This One!,"This is an excellent adaptation of a novel, far better than most adaptations. I've been to see it 4 times (I'm not usually that type) and each time the audience is larger and more expressive. Full burst of applause at the end, as at a play. Too bad there's no curtain call, because everyone is great. This movie, I'm afraid, is going to get ripped off at the Oscars. I've seen many excellent movies this year, but this is the best. Watch for the little things. ([1] I think the last line of the movie is an ""in"" joke. [2] Del assumes a Jesus-crucified position as his mouse runs across his shoulders. [3] John refers to God specifically as ""God the Father""; there is more than a hint that he himself represents the Son, whose initials {and, in some cases, abilities} he shares. [4] Check out the names on the tombstones at Elaine's funeral. [5] Old Paul's teacup is one of a set that he and his wife had in the 30s. [6] Melinda gives John a St. Christopher medal; St. Christopher is supposed to have carried Christ to safety once. [7] Hammersmith, an unsympathetic observer of the early part of John's ordeal, has a name that suggests preparation for crucifixion. No doubt there's more!)",10.0,itchy-8,2000/01/10,2,2

There is a clear sense here that all involved in the production knew that this was something special, and gave it their all. See this film if you truly enjoy actors giving everything to their craft. Watch for the countless subtleties of expression, and the great power that the cast creates with silence. This is evident in the opening sequence and remains throughout.

349,Ferris Bueller's Day Off,"Not just one of the best comedies of all time, but one of the best movies PERIOD","My friends knowing that I'm a huge film buff asked me to come up with a list of my favorite movies of all time, when it came down to number one, there was one film that stood out in my head that I knew I could watch over and over again and never get sick of: Ferris Bueller's Day Off. One of the best comedies of all time, Ferris Bueller is a movie that just stands the test of time. How anyone could not love this film is beyond any of my understanding, Ferris Bueller is my hero among many others. John Hughes is usually remembered more for The Breakfast Club, which is an incredible movie as well, but I think this was his masterpiece. He said in an interview that this was his childhood, getting his wife and best friend and skipping out on school to go down town and just have a good time. If you are a Chicago citizen, you've pulled a Ferris Beuller's day off too, it's like a law here, lol, if you haven't, I pity you. The reason that this movie works is because of it's outrageous story that everyone wants to live, Matthew Broderick, there was no other choice, he is who everyone wants to be: Ferris Bueller. Ferris Bueller is a teenager who fakes out his parents on being sick, even though it is his worst performance of being ill, somehow it works and his parents let him stay home. He takes the gorgeous day outside, takes his really sick best friend and his girlfriend and goes into beautiful Chicago for a blast of good times. I'm not kidding fellow Chicagoians, this is the best Chicago movie! Ferris has two problems though, his principal who is sick of being made a fool of and decides to bust Ferris on his fake illness. And his sister Jeanie, who cares more about Ferris's life than her own and just wants to prove that he's faking it. Even though, you have to admit that it's a bit unrealistic that it is broadcast throughout Chicago that Ferris is ""dying"" and no one notices that he's singing in the Chicago parade, on a field trip to the Art Institute with an elementary class, getting ""snootie"" with a waiter at Chicago's finest restaurant, and catching the Cub's home run ball at Wrigley Field, you just have fun and cannot stop laughing. Plus you have got to love Edward Rooney, the obsessed principal who is actually sicker than Ferris in one way of putting it. He goes through the whole city to find him just so Ferris doesn't make a fool of him, but he fails on all levels because Ferris is just that awesome. The scene between him and Grace when Cameron prank calls to get Ferris' girlfriend out of school is just too hilarious and will have you in stitches. I don't know what else to honestly say other than this movie is the best comedy to watch if you are looking for a great laugh. So sit, back and enjoy because "" life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and take a look around once in a while, you might miss it""; my philosophy. I will love Ferris Bueller till the day I die. 10/10",10.0,Smells_Like_Cheese,2003/11/05,243,187
350,Ferris Bueller's Day Off,John Hughes Classic,"Ferris Bueller's Day Off is one of my all time favourite comedies and one of my all time favourite movies over all. John Hughes was a great and underrated comedy writer and director and this is probably his best comedy overall. But I have to admit for ""best John Hughes"" movie it would be tough to beat ""Trains, Planes and Automobiles"" which is almost as funny and also incredibly touching, with a couple of John Candy's scenes almost making me cry. In Ferris Bueller the story is a simple one of a brilliant but underachieving student scheming his way out of going to school by convincing his parents and trying to convince his principal that he is sick. A running joke is that the students at the school are incredibly worried about him as if he is at death's door, which really annoys his sister who is stuck going to school and knows that he is completely healthy. He also gets his girlfriend out of school, as well as his hypochondriac friend Cameron who has serious daddy issues which come to a head at the end of the movie. That poor poor car!

351,Ferris Bueller's Day Off,Still skipping school - at age 50!,"Maybe I am stuck in the past, but I never tire of watching this movie in reruns... and I just turned 50! It must be the secret dream of every adult (as well as student) to just ""check out"" for the day! And there's no better person to pal around with than Ferris. This guy could probably turn a trip for a root canal into a picnic. Perfect casting all around - from the oh-so-typical Bueller family to Grace, the school secretary (who has a line on all the school cliques - the dweebs, motorheads, sportos, etc) Didn't everybody have an Ed Rooney in the head office? There is something for everybody on this joyride through Chicago. From the ballpark to the art museum to the parade and everything in between - a day could not have more fun crammed into it. Even those angst-ridden teen characters (Jeannie/Shawna and Cameron) have an upspin in their lives. All in all, a great time was had by all.

352,Primal Fear,"Gere's sheister-lawyer will have you wondering ""What IS the difference between a lawyer and a whore?!""","Primal Fear(1996) takes great care at first to paint its protagonist Martin Vale(Richard Gere) as an arrogant, high-profile ambulance chaser--largely through the rather obvious narrative device of having him be interviewed for a magazine cover-story. Nevertheless director Gregory Hoblit (""NYPD Blue""(TV), Frequency(2000)) teases out a sheister's midnight musings--telegraphing that Vale is missing something--when he has the lawyer tell THE lawyer-joke ALL WRONG during the fade-in: the correct punchline to ""What's the difference between a lawyer and a whore?"", is ""-The whore stops scr**ing you after you're dead"". This is Vale's emotional journey: how he became a sheister, whom he left behind, and whether, if we scratch his surface, he still has an ethical heart beating beneath his cocky-and-selfish exterior. Gere does his usual good job, delivering a solid performance elevated by terrific chemistry with his leading lady, even providing the movie with a stunning ending--but Primal Fear has become Edward Norton's star-maker, and an instant classic for it. It's now the stuff of Hollywood legend how Norton was so impressive during his reading for the part of Aaron/Roy Stampler, that Tinseltown fell all over itself offering the unknown its meatiest parts even before Fear was ""in the can"". He's had a golden career since, being allowed to direct his 6th film (Keeping the Faith(2000)); and his fast rise in Hollywood has seemingly impelled Ed in private to question if this is all there is. But Norton doesn't carry the acting load all by himself--that's spread out evenly among the top-notch cast assembled by Deborah Aquila and Jane Shannon. Laura Linney's edgy and ""pi$$ed-off-as-hell"" lone female lawyer certainly deflects much of Norton's glory. Linney(Absolute Power(1997), Kinsey(2005), Jindabyne(2006)) for my money steals the movie, amply evidencing her Julliard training. Her Janet Venables is Vale's cynical nicotine-sucking ex-protégé, still plugging away at the State Attorney's Office long after he quit. Vale resents her lack of equal conviction, yet pines for her, having previously abandoned their romance. Unfortunately--or fortunately--she is still smarting from his arrogant self-serving attitude, and now gleefully baits him at every opportunity. She has plenty, since they're opposing counsel in the Stampler case, and Linney delivers a wonderful 'bit' as she angrily apes Stampler to Vale: ""I gotta admit, that FACE is GREAT--you prepping him to take the stand? That stutter is p-p-p-p-priceless""! As noted, there are many familiar faces, mostly from TV: powerhouse Andre Braugher (""Homicide--Life on the Street""); soft-spoken Joe Spano (""Hill Street Blues""); prototypically-Irish-yet-deceptively-broiling John Mahoney (""Frasier""); sublimely blasé Alfre Woodard (""St Elsewhere""); and even pixyishly competent Maura Tierney (Liar Liar(1997)). As in all the best courtroom-dramas, Fear is both socio-political and character-driven. It's packed to the brim with backstory for every character, thanks to its previous incarnation as a William Diehl novel. The gutsy Ann Biderman/Steve Shagan screenplay, combined with Hoblit's intelligent direction, allows the human relationships to be complex and to have lots of history, often with each other. At just over 2hrs, Fear is a riveting education in the routine abduction of our legal system by the rich and powerful. They usually turn out to be the city fathers. John Shaughnessy(Mahoney), the State Attorney, knows he is the pivot of considerable financial skullduggery amidst the intimate secrets of all the usual players when he claims that ""this city doesn't burn because I won't permit it"". This subplot recalls the notion of ""menschkeit"" from Ken Lipper's similarly-intentioned City Hall(1996). The sudden, surprising fate of Vale's other client Joey Pinero (Steven Bauer, aka the skinny ""gerbil"" from Running Scared(1986), Det.Sigliano) serves as silent exposition to Shaughnessy's m.o.: it's a clue as to why Vale quit Shaughnessy's office in the first place. Such lightning-bolts do make Miss Venables' determination to stay actually hard to comprehend, but her resultant tensile-steel-composure among men speaks volumes. Her tough-minded presence in ""the enemy camp"" offers Vale one last opportunity not to underestimate her. When he doesn't, it's the best compliment he could've paid her, relieving much of his earlier guilt. We discover Shaughnessy's surprising personal stake in the Stampler case way late into the last quarter, as Vale FINALLY introduces it in court. The overdue explanation seems somewhat annoying, since the financial skullduggery represents a powerful motive for all those not on trial. Stampler's backstory, too, must be as interesting as his awesome portrayal by Norton. His remark to Vale's psychiatrist (the surprisingly dull Frances McDormand (Fargo(2000)) that his father WAS not a nice man, is significant. He is making a distinction between the deaths of his father and mother, essentially ""burying the lead"". There is one more clue about Stampler's feelings towards duplicitous people: his resentful flash of emotion upon being forced to admit that the archbishop's bending of altar-boy rules on Stampler's behalf was ""nice of him"". In hindsight, it's possible to guess at Stampler's tortured--and terrifying--inner world. All this propels us towards the closing dilemma. We witness Vale's satisfaction at uncovering one onion-layer of truth as he finally exposes his former boss, but then lose his own righteous certainty once he realises that complete faith in innocence is also misplaced. This becomes the sheister's lament: ""Why gamble with money when you can gamble with people's lives?!"" Where do you put your faith when no-one is ""clean""? Credit must go to DoP Michael Chapman for Fear's profound epilogue: it depicts Gere's cuckolded lawyer trying to grasp his own humanity. Chapman visualises Vale's (suddenly) topsy-turvy-world with a tracking-overhead shot using a hothead mount, as Vale walks from the courtroom. The scene restores to a normal dolly shot as his cold stop--and bewilderment--jolts us into desperation, wondering if this hadn't just been Martin Vale's very LAST attempt at compassion.(10/10)",10.0,lizziebeth-1,2006/09/04,18,15

355,Interstellar,Matthew McConaughey explains the origin of his daughter's name. To his daughter's face.,"Science fiction fans don't need everything spelling out for them. That's why the narration was removed from Blade Runner. That's why 2001: A Space Odyssey has no dialogue in its opening and closing twenty minutes. That's why R2D2 doesn't speak English. There's a scene in Interstellar in which Matthew McConaughey explains the origin of his daughter's name. To his daughter's face. This blunt method of explaining Murphy's Law to the audience is just one example of the unnecessary exposition which Interstellar's running time is so bloated by. It is also the first of many inferior echoes of Contact. In Contact, James Woods explains Occam's Razor in a similar fashion, however it is justified by the court of law context in which the scene takes place. More significantly however is the lifting of a major theme from Contact in which Jodie Foster never fully moves on from the loss of her father. Jessica Chastain's character here does likewise, only without the emotional resonance because she is so bitter that it's hard to sympathise with her. The other female character in 'Interstellar' (yeah there's only two) also spends all her screen time pining after a man. Feminists - stay away! Another silly moment is the shot for shot homage to Event Horizon. This is when one scientist explains to another scientist what a wormhole is. Which is like a driving instructor explaining to another driving instructor what biting point is. It wouldn't happen, like, ever. At least when Sam Neil gave the low down on wormholes in Event Horizon he was addressing blue collar workers so it was, once again, justified by context. Perhaps the goofiest thing in the whole film is TARS, a computer with delusions of being the next HAL 9000, which is actually nothing more than metallic origami. Have I mentioned it knows a joke? Yeah it has been programmed with one joke and it uses this joke many times. The joke is that humour is quantifiable by percentage. Why watch this when you can watch Contact, 2001: A Space Odyssey or Silent Running? Why go for Christopher Nolan's take on Dust Bowl migration when you can read John Steinbeck's instead? On a positive note there are some cool graphics to look at. You know, like the cool graphics in The Hobbit or Transformers.",,simonpercival-567-207896,2014/12/13,131,68
356,The Fault in Our Stars,No fault in Woodley's star-making performance,"""The Fault in Our Stars"" is one of the most talked about films from last year and this over 2-hour-long film won big at several awards shows that were mostly aimed at younger audiences. It is the second directorial effort by Josh Boone and the writing came from the team that worked on ""(500) Days of Summer"". Lead actress is Shailene Woodley and her male co-lead is played by Ansel Elgort. The supporting cast includes Oscar nominees like Laura Dern and Willem Dafoe. This movie is about a woman suffering from cancer, but that's really just the background story. With the Big C always present, we get to watch how she spends her final months with friends and family. Woodley is truly outstanding in the lead and there is no denying that she easily belongs to the most talented actresses from her age group. She took a break from acting between 2007 and 2011, but returned by holding her own against Hollywood star George Clooney in the Oscar-winning ""The Descendants"" and since then it's been a triumphant walk for her leading several movies. This one here is just another great addition to her résumé. Unfortunately, I am not too big on Ansel Elgort here. There is something pretty off-putting about him on several occasions. I am not sure if it's the way the character was written, his (mediocre) acting or a combination of both. In any case, he looked really weak compared to Woodley and I can't see him carry a movie that runs for over 2 hours and he is in it for 1.5 hours pretty much. I rarely had the impression I was watching a genuine character instead of a performance. The script is fine for the most part. Sometimes it gets into territory in which it feels it sacrifices realism for a sob story, but that's fine as it only is maybe 2 or 3 times. I think in terms of the subject, this still could have been much more authentically emotional, but what the writers came up with isn't a failure either. I did not know Dafoe was in this film, but I enjoyed his short performance. I honestly did not need the second part of his cameo near the end as it was nowhere near as memorable as his first couple scenes. All in all, I cannot agree with the critics and awards bodies who really loved this movie. Still, I believe this is a decent watch. It's just that I would not put it anywhere near my favorite 2014 movies. My favorite cancer-themed film of all time is still ""A Walk to Remember"". But back to this one: Shailene Woodley is very much outstanding in here. Too bad she is the only real reason to check it out.",6.0,Horst_In_Translation,2015/11/22,4,3

The only good thing I can say for the movie is that it's not predictable, that's about it.

359,Taxi Driver,An insufferable bore,"De Niro plays You-talkinna-me Travis Bickle, a loner and a socially inept New York City cabby who takes the job because 'he cannot sleep at night'. As Travis sees more and more of the filth and depredation on the streets he tours, he turns to violence in an attempt to better the world. The movie is insufferably slow and repetitive while it channels the impressions Travis gets moonlighting the streets of New York. The dialog throughout the film feels unnatural and hammy and sucks the life out of an otherwise potentially interesting watch. There's also not much of a plot here which makes the 2 hour viewing quite a challenge. Foster does well but simply isn't believable as a child prostitute working for a pimp played by Keitel. Keitel himself also fails to convince due to the lackluster and rather phony script. Shepherd makes a short and forgettable appearance as Travis his love interest and seems to be cast only for her pretty eyes and patented stare. Though wonderfully moody and well filmed, Taxi Driver is at its core an uninteresting character piece that goes on too long and tells us too little. The music score consists of variations on two jazzy reprises by Bernard Herrmann that are set on repeat throughout the film.

361,The Wailing,The Wailing is Coming From the Audience,"Wow. After all of the glowing user and critical reviews, what a let down. As others have noted, the first part of this long film has almost a comedic tone before things really get serious. And having lived in S. Korea and having a Korean wife, I understand most of the cultural differences we see as American viewers. For example, as a smaller, much more homogeneous society, with a much lower crime rate, policemen often don't carry guns and see violent crime as an aberration and not just an excuse to crack skulls, lock up everyone in sight and pile on as many charges as possible. Still, after the young girl stabbed the baby sitter, I think she would have been institutionalized for further observation. This move would have removed her from her part in the bloody finale. As for the supernatural back and forth honestly, I have zero supernatural superstitions or beliefs, so the filmmaker must build a strong, logical and coincidental case to get my buy in. This movie doesn't do that, so at the end of the day, it all comes off as pretty silly and yawn inducing--much like a similar American movie which also garnered raves, The Witch.

This movie was all the rage when it came out and my friends were peer pressuring me to go see it so we did.

I also don't think cancer patients look that healthy or athletic (ie Gus), but what do I know? The only character that I felt was in touch with reality is the writer, but of course angsty teen princess Hazel wants none of this BS. How dare he tell her to get over herself?! I don't even wanna touch the scene where they go to Anne Frank House, because it'll make me reconsider my 3 stars rating and I'm struggling to keep an open mind about this movie. I really am.

364,The Wailing,A Top 5 Movie of 2016,"* Disclaimer - If you are familiar with South Korean Cinema you should come to expect some silly/oddball humor thrown into a serious thriller (which this film is). Most will find it off putting and I admit I too at times find it rather off putting. But once you get past those moments early on in the movie (an epic 2.5 hour runtime), you'll be rewarded with one of the year's best films! * The movie is all about the foreboding sense that something sinister is coming. Numerous scenes tease this feeling and it's simply bliss. Characters interact with the antagonist early on and you know it's a mistake that is sure to have consequences. It's refreshing to see this type of structure. * ""The Wailing"" is one of the best movies of the year. Period. It features one of the best exorcism scenes of all time, mostly thanks to a cultural difference (coming from outside the USA). The movie leads you in one direction only to pull the rug out from under your feet and throw you in a new direction. It's a movie that keeps you guessing till the final frame, never letting you get too comfortable trusting any specific character. The deceit and misdirection in the movie is simply brilliant! *** An impressive 9/10 (only negatives are those 'silly' comedic relief scenes that feel completely out of place at times) ***",9.0,MattBirk,2016/12/07,9,3
365,Spider-Man 2,Spectacular comic book fun!,"It is well known that Peter Parker is probably most well liked because of his human weaknesses than for his superpowers. He's a comic book superhero who is presented as just a normal guy who suddenly finds himself in possession of amazing powers that he doesn't quite understand or know how best to use, just like any of us would probably react. A lot of people were dissatisfied with the original film for a whole list of superficial reasons, but even those minor shortcomings seem to have been fixed for this sequel, which is one of the best comic book movies I've ever seen. Peter Parker is in college now and remains hopelessly in love with Mary Jane, but also remains a hopeless romantic, to say nothing of his unwillingness to get close to her for fear of endangering her. Superheroes, you see, tend to make enemies easily. And speaking of enemies, the villains in Spiderman 2 are a much welcome step up from Willem Dafoe's too- clownish Green Goblin with the plastic mask. There is a complicated history between Parker and Harry Osborn (James Franco), who is both in love with Mary Jane and the son of Norman Osborn, the alter-ego of the Green Goblin in the first film. As revelations are made about who Parker really is, their best friend relationship of course becomes increasingly prickly. Alfred Molina is also brilliant as the perfectly named Dr. Otto Octavius, the main villain, a benevolent scientist whose desire to create a means for harnessing cold fusion turns him into a madman, which is complicated by the fact that he has developed a way to connect some massive and enormously destructive metal tentacles to his body, enabling him to climb buildings like a spider and crush and toss humans around with equal ease. There is a scene involving a group of doctors that really reminds you who the director is. ""Doc Ock"" has a laboratory on the bank of the East River in which he has created a device which will either prove that he can use cold fusion or, if he fails, will destroy all of Manhattan. Parker doesn't think it's worth the risk, and the grand climax of the movie culminates in the final fulfillment of Octavius' experiment while Spiderman tries to stop it and save Mary Jane at the same time. It seems that Spiderman 2 is the result of a production team that openly discussed what might be weaknesses in the still fun and exciting original film, and how to fix them and make them better in the sequel. Superhero movies are often hit or miss, and usually it's pretty obvious what the misses are (hear that, Punisher?). The original Spiderman was a hit, and the first sequel is a bigger hit.

366,Moon,Good movie worth your moon time,"This movie was really good to say the least.I couldn't decide what was real at times which I love in movies. Another thing that I thought about a movie that earn a 10 in my book is that it had a really good soundtrack that seemed to know what to play at the right moment, rather if it be something funny or sad, it was on time the whole entire movie which was a plus. This would be an excellent movie to add to your science fiction collection. I would recommended this movie to my friends (and I usually do) and I know they will enjoy as did I. Best supporting robotic actor I'd say too, at times you can't tell about him, which kept me on edge.

367,The Green Mile,"A Masterpiece of Cinematic Art -- Captivating, Reverent, Tear-Inducing","""The Green Mile"" expertly mixes film genres: It's part prison flick, part supernatural mystery and part drama. It was adapted from Stephen King's novel by director/writer Frank Darabont and released in 1999. If you're not an admirer of Stephen King books/films (I'm not) DON'T let that deter you from viewing this beautiful and spiritually-profound film; ""The Green Mile"" is by no means a typical horror story, although it does have a couple of horrific scenes. THE STORY: Tom Hanks plays the head Death Row guard at a Tennessee prison during the Depression. A new inmate is introduced, a hulking black man named John Coffey (exquisitely played by Michael Clarke Duncan), who is condemned to death for the rape and murder of two little girls. Hanks and his guard friends slowly become intrigued by the seemingly pure-hearted giant and begin to realize that he is eminently gifted in a decidedly supernatural way; they conclude that there's no way he could be guilty of the crime. If that's the case, who is guilty? And will the guilty party get away with it. ""The Green Mile"" is a 3-hour film, way over my limited attention span, and yet it is somehow utterly engrossing, even on repeat viewings. The film is character/dialogue driven, unique and wholly unpredictable. Please don't mistake this for a run-of-the-mill prison flick. The fact that it largely takes place in a prison in the 1930s is a secondary issue. This is an incredibly powerful supernatural mystery/drama. *** SPOILER ALERT *** (Don't read this next paragraph unless you want to consider possibilities about the character John Coffey) John Coffey's last name is, evidently, derived from an ancient Sumerian word, kophi, which means ""winged creature."" Hence, John could be viewed as a angel or messenger from the Almighty. In truth, John is an obvious type of Jesus Christ verified in six ways: (1.) His initials are J.C. (2.) He's completely pure/good-hearted and can easily recognize true evil. (3.) He miraculously heals people. (4.) He pronounces and executes divine judgment. (5.) He is sacrificed even though completely innocent. And (6.) He offers eternal life (in a sense), as evidenced by the extended life-span of the Hanks character and the mouse ""Mr. Jingles."" *** End SPOILER ALERT *** BOTTOM LINE: Make no mistake, ""The Green Mile"" is one of the greatest films ever made. It ranks up there with my 5 or 10 best. Don't miss out on this cinematic masterpiece. Now please excuse me while I wipe the tears from my face.",9.0,Wuchakk,2011/08/19,9,5
368,Goodfellas,Predictable story of an average gangster,"At a most general level the movie is about a dilemma of an average gangster. At certain point in his career if things go wrong, an average mobster faces a dilemma. A dilemma of becoming either a 'rat' or a 'martyr'. At the story level the most of the characters are all too 'rationalistic', in the sense that most of the time they are doing whatever they got to do to stay fit and survive. Probably the only exception is Tommy DeVito, whose overcompensating, psychotic aggression makes him the only interesting character. However, even in his case, the all too 'rationalistic' social milieu makes his fate far to predictable. Everybody except Tommy know the rules and know the limits. There are rules to rob, rules to kill, rules to betray and rules to go to jail. Tommy is the only person that challenges the order. Overall, contrary to romantic stereotypes, the portrayal of mafia world gives a picture of strict subordination and 'law-abidingness'. The story gives the picture of the mafia world that is exactly the opposite of what the narrator's childhood memories describe. What seemed to be the world of the free, daring and interesting, strong men, appears as a world of socially conditioned, 'rationalistic' and predictable world of predator mammals, who do whatever their dominant cultural environment permits or commands them to do.",1.0,lashawill,2012/12/19,71,25

371,Detachment,"Powerful dark movie, with a hopeful ending","Detachment portrays a glum view of the current education system at what could be any city school and the life of young children who are not supported by their parents. It is full of cynicism and the entire film is shrouded in darkness that comes out exemplary in Adrien Brody's performance. What stayed with me the most was not the bleak lives the children live, but rather the look behind the scenes at the teachers. In one beautiful scene James Caan tells Lucy Lui's guidance counselor character that ""no one ever says thank you"". I don't think many people stop to think how their actions affect teachers, people who are essentially there to help them develop as people and support them. I hope this movie can inspire people to think back on their school life and maybe just write one teacher that stood out and say thank you. Brody's character gives narration throughout the film that give the story a good direction and while the climax of the movie is not surprising, it is beautifully done, with a flashback to Brody's mother that adds pain without being too obvious. Now the film could have ended at the climax with a dark and bleak ending, but it does not. The ending in my eyes is beautifully done and left me in tears, not out of sadness but out of hope.",8.0,juvest,2013/11/05,5,3
372,Blackfish,Powerful and Compelling,"The first of the several times I've watched this I realized that it moved me because as an owner of pit bulls I am disgusted that animals have been mistreated for human entertainment. And there is no doubt that there is an overwhelming amount of evidence that there is no such thing as a truly happy killer whale in captivity. I do think I have a couple of spins different from the critical reviews I've read i want to share. First of all I actually love to debate animal rights, especially when it gets to the extreme point of defending eating a salad instead of a burger, because the cow has a soul and therefore rights. This is scientifically indefensible. By definition an animal is a multi-celled (no bacteria) heterotroph (eats something, no plants). So the debate inevitably generates into why people would think insects as animals wouldn't have rights when puppies do. And there are lots of other animals PETA probably doesn't care about, but by definition are animals. My favorite example is the lamprey. Hair-splitting. That being said it may seem strange that I would be motivated to become an advocate of Seaworld being shut down. The real reason not to abuse animals is because it's just plain stupid. My pit bulls have been perfectly loving companions and should be considered ""just another dog."" I've treated them better than just and decent. Spoiled. Secondly, the fraud and lies. Seaworld's cover up of the reason for Dawn's death. The whale pulled her into the water by her ponytail because he thought it was a toy. During a live show with the security cameras running. When a court case came about and you could have shown your footage to support your side Seaworld's defense was magically absent of any footage supporting their side. Really? Seaworld claims that the animals live longer in captivity? Really? It's like half the life span or less. I think it's easy to postulate that a killer whale living 90 years in the wild with their families is a lot more fun than being put in a too small tank with no stimulation and dying before forty is a lot more fun. This is from the Net - Seaworld has taken out advertising time to claim that the documentary is not accurate and misleading. Really? If you feel that strongly about your side, in this litigious society you didn't slap the makers of this with a lawsuit? Director Gail got her ducks in a row for this. Seaworld has no good answers. Which is why as mentioned a couple of times that it's mentioned Seaworld declined to comment. She didn't have to make an advocacy spin. She didn't have to say, ""Go to PETA's site and make a donation."" She just needed to present the facts and the overwhelming amount of evidence to support the conclusion that logical and decent people would come to. This is the best documentary I've ever seen. It opened my eyes to something I never knew before.",10.0,PaJRJ,2014/01/08,15,13

374,Blackfish,Nice orca; let's torture it. Murder mystery with SeaWorld as villain and you as willing accomplice.,"In February 2010, reports of the accidental death of a killer whale trainer, Dawn Brancheau, at SeaWorld, Orlando featured in newspapers and TV bulletins across the globe. How could such a tragedy occur? What on earth was Brancheau thinking? How could she make such a silly mistake? Then the story changed and it appeared this very experienced trainer was attacked by the orca, Tilikum. Shockwaves rippled. What? A gentle giant killed a human that cared for it? Suddenly killer whales lived up to their fearsome moniker and became the villains of the moment. Then the story changed again and the truth began to emerge Blackfish is a startling documentary from Gabriela Cowperthwaite that investigates the reality behind the sparkling waters and bright lights of the SeaWorld parks, not that they are alone in their mistreatment of these startling, intelligent, beautiful creatures. She trawls through the archives to reveal that Brancheau's death was neither a freak accident nor an isolated attack from a vicious animal, but just one of many examples since humans decided it was acceptable to kidnap young orcas for the pleasure and pockets of humans. Kidnap? Is such a strong word appropriate? Watch Blackfish, listen to the mother make ""sounds we've never heard an orca make before"" in a harrowing display of grief and then decide. Watching Blackfish and still choosing to visit SeaWorld or another such aquatic zoo is surely on the same level as taking your kids to McDonalds even though you know you're poisoning them. If I were reviewing the subject of Blackfish, like 2009's powerfully distressing The Cove, it would surely warrant a perfect score. Upon the evidence here, even if you've chosen not to see the truth of our actions in the past, there's no contest. It's wrong, it's unacceptable, it's a despicable thing we do when we steal these creatures from their oceans and trap them in tiny prisons. But the review is not for the subject matter but for the manner in which it is presented to us. Blackfish isn't perfect. It doesn't have quite the same profound, lasting impact as The Cove. Perhaps that is, in part, down to the lack of shocking imagery. The footage of orcas bleeding copiously into their pools, having been attacked by other killer whales, is sickening but because it is on a smaller scale than the mass slaughter of dolphins that dyed the cove scarlet there is a risk the impact will be reduced. It shouldn't be, it mustn't be, but We shouldn't need to see it to believe it, but we've become a far more visually inspired breed in recent years. More than that, Blackfish doesn't give a lot of time to the other side of the story. I'm intrigued to know quite how SeaWorld could possibly defend its actions but, as they declined to be interviewed, this is a very one-sided documentary. I can't help thinking this imperative cause would be even more compelling if we could hear the excuses. Another unexplained mystery is how Cowperthwaite obtained the footage she has of SeaWorld. Presumably they didn't give it to her willingly. But these are minor quibbles with a documentary that is as sickening as it is compelling. Interviews with apologetic, horrified former SeaWorld trainers and tear-streaked 'kidnappers' impart the information we need to educate, inform, convince or perhaps even convert us. First, Cowperthwaite teaches us about the orcas: Their brains are superior to ours in certain aspects; their emotional attachment far exceeds ours, with offspring remaining with their mother long into adulthood; each family group (or pod) has it's own culture and 'language' for communication. She then counters that with the lies perpetuated by the SeaWorld staff that we choose to believe: Orcas live longer, up to 35 years, in captivity due to the care available – actually, in the wild, it's up to 50 for males and can be closer to a hundred for the females. Male dorsal fin collapse is normal – absolutely, it's 100% in captivity. However, in their natural environment it occurs approximately 1% of the time. Killer whales enjoy performing the tricks in tiny pools for us – um As more and more evidence of orca psychosis brought on by cruelty and captivity unfolds, Blackfish becomes increasingly difficult to watch. The sight of peeling paint in a tiny, floating warehouse into which the orcas are herded every night is saddening. Hearing that they are punished for not performing perfectly is horrifying. Watching them bleed, observing them rock in grief or cry out to their stolen offspring is heartbreaking. The message throughout Blackfish is that faceless managers steal killer whales (along with dolphins and countless other creatures) from their natural habitats, subject them to abuse and solitary confinement in woefully cramped enclosures so that we can pay to watch them perform unnatural tricks for our cameras, and so the owners can watch their bank accounts swell. The message is, it isn't about entertainment or protection of a species, it's about money. But what stamps the reality more indelibly than anything that comes before it, is the comment from one of the former trainers in the final scene. As they sail through the ocean, watching a pod of killer whales free and at peace in their natural environment, he comments, ""We saw orcas swimming in straight lines with straight dorsal fins... it was an honour.""

375,The Green Mile,"this is the best, most emotional movie I've ever seen","I must say, i gotta commend this movie for its emotionally raw portrayal of death row guards.

376,Intermission,"Great Actors, Pretty Good Movie","Fantastic performances by almost all the cast. Great characters, and some very funny dialogue. The movie does suffer from ""where is all this going"" syndrome at stages but underneath the hard exterior and very believable characters (Farrel is fantastic and super realistic as the local scumbag) lies a story simply about finding someone to get through life with. It works for the most part but gets lost a few times along the way which drags the movie down. Some tighter editing and maybe a bit more experience on the part of the first time writer and director may have helped. But a good first time outing for them that bodes well for the future of Irish filmmaking which has for too long spat out ""Waking Ned"" over and over again. The main plus for me about this movie is that I think it is the first movie to show a real picture of modern working class Ireland. I really like the R.Doyle Barrytown Trilogy but the reality of those movies is softened by the humour whereas the humour here is much more cynical and that translates to a much more realistic feel. I'm sorry that some people feel some way offended by this realism but YES believe it or not there is crime out here in Oirland too. Despite the misconceptions we don't just sit around all day drinking Guinness while producing Lucky Charms and having a chat with the local Leprechaun. One comment about the accents. The movie is an IRISH movie set in IRELAND. I'm sorry that you cannot understand it sometimes but what would you prefer, that the movie be shot with generic American accents?

The key to this all, is that this movie came first, so while watching it with that modern lens makes it feel less original and less of a classic, truly it shows just why it is a great film and has the renown that it deserves. For, without this film, many modern films that we know and love today may have been very different, if exist at all. The movie has one feeling the natural unease that comes with watching those around them be corrupted and destroyed while at the same time one of them is trying to soothe you and tell you that everything is going to be all right.

The story is completely bullshit and makes no sense whatsoever. You will get that point if you are living in an actual world and not in the make believe world of Hollywood. The trailers I watched which made me compelled to see this movie are way better and interesting than the movie itself!

I was a bit worried that my 5 year old would be a bit scared by some of the scenes, but this movie is totally kid safe. The scariest thing that happens is a couple of loud screams and some glowing red eyes. No problem. Adam Sandler does a great job as the voice of Dracula. Not too over the top and constantly delivering some great lines. Andy Samberg and Selina Gomez (surprisingly) both do a great job as Jonathan (nice touch) and Mavis respectively. I also loved Steve Buscemi as ""Wayne"". Unfortunately Fran Drescher who can usually deliver some sharp witty comedy isn't allowed to shine as her jokes throughout the film have been done to death and didn't bring much to the film at all. There are some great hidden jokes/sight gags, and some beautiful animation and character designs that will please old school horror fans and adults, but the only part that I found utterly cringe worthy was the end scene with Dracula rapping (even after his joke about Twilight!)

381,The Wailing,Few neat symbolisms but I don't want to re-watch it for some clarification.,"Now I liked the previous film this director made called ""The Chaser"". Because it has a simple premise that delved into humanity but kept me thinking. And by the end it really did stick with me when I first saw it. This one tries to outdo that film by trying to add bunch of imagery and symbolisms. By meshing a lot of elements the director borrowed from other films that are left ambiguous. But the thing is the narrative isn't up to par and tries to be bigger than what it is. I could tell what the director of this film was trying to do. To keep the audiences guessing and leave things a bit complex. So by the end of it they will be in awe with what is going on and keep them talking about exactly what happened. Now I appreciate director's that don't spoon feed you everything that is going on. It works if the film flows with it's narrative, but this just seemed more complex for the sake of being complex. Like he was trying to make things a bit more ambiguous for the audiences and leave it up to the viewers to comprehend what is going on. Which works in films if everything flows together and isn't forced. But it's like the director took a simple story and made it more complex than it really is and added bunch of imagery and symbolism. So the plot takes plays in a country side rural village. Where weird things start to go down with some of the villagers acting very strangely, saying vile things and becoming zombie like. They think some old Japanese guy is the source of what is going on. When one of the police officers start to look to be possessed they hire a shaman. And thing start to get even more crazy from there on. The thing about this movie is that it's overlong and I think it could have been shortened down to about 2 hours and cut 30 minutes of it out. Because the build up is actually quite boring and things start to get a bit interesting and escalate the tension after one and a half hours in. Which is actually quite long to get to the meat of the movie. I will admit few of the symbolisms and how it comes together is actually quite neat. But as a whole the film seemed to suffer from the issue that arises from the storytelling aspect of things. Overall, it did have some good points with few of the symbolism and re-watching it may clarify certain things but I really don't want to. 6/10",6.0,KineticSeoul,2016/08/08,30,13
382,Moon,A good solid pulp science fiction film but I don't think its the next great all time classic,"Directed by Duncan Jones, who is the son of David Bowie, this film has been hailed as the next coming of the great SCIFI God. Its been compared and any number of classic films. Much as been made of the fact that the film feels awfully familiar, it borrowing bits of other films looks for its look. I think its familiar because it a place I've been before. The plot has astronaut Sam Rockwell coming to the end of his three year term as the only man on an automated mining base on the far side of the moon. His only companion is Gerty, the computer, voiced by Kevin Spacey.. He dreams of his wife and just wants to get home so that he can see his young daughter. However the isolation is getting to to him and when he wakes up after an accident things have become different. I could tell you more but thats as far as most people writing on the film have taken it, so I will bow to their line in the sand and leave it there (though many who insist that the less you know is better reveal ""too much"" by comparing it to a certain now classic film from the early 1980's). They seem to think that what happens after that point is some huge revelation. I don't think so I think what happens, while perfectly in keeping with the story isn't as important as what that sets in motion. I really like this film. Its a good solid pulp science fiction film about a man alone in space. I do not think this is the next ""great"" science fiction film. I don't think its revelations are mind blowing. I think its a well thought out film with a great deal to say about man and mankind. I really wish that people would stop placing this film on a pedestal, because it doesn't belong there for the reasons that they are claiming. The film may, some day earn a place on a high but for right now, its the idle chatter of people who really haven't seen too many science fiction films, or if not they aren't versed in the golden age of pulp scifi stories that bled over into the golden days of radio and the early days of television. I kept waiting for the film to hit me with some grand revelation, but it never came. In all honesty it wasn't until the accident and the film got down to doing what it does that I stopped waiting for something the film wasn't and took it for what it is. Don't get me wrong. This is a really good little film, its just not the next big thing. There is much to like about the film. Sam Rockwell is very good in a role that is nicely restrained and not out in left field. Its one several recent performances that have me warming to him and his style. The look of the film, borrowed from films like 2001, Space 1999, Solaris, Outland and others has a nice lived in feel. I love Kevin Spacey's Gerty. I'm going to kind of give a spoiler here and say I like his performance as a sort of anti-Hal 9000. There are moments where he will move you. The plot, when stripped of the hype is actually quite good and it raises all sorts of interesting questions (Which I won't get into since they might reveal late in the game plot points). And while the film does have a couple of plot bumps, nothing is major and the film hangs nicely together. Recommended for anyone wanting a good science fiction yarn. Let the hype go and just go and enjoy it. (Frankly comparing it to things like 2001, Solaris and other great head films is a major mistake since it shrinks your audience who won't go thinking its one thing-as I did- when in fact its something else.)",7.0,dbborroughs,2009/08/01,10,5

The plot focuses mainly upon the life of Henry Barthes, an emotionally overwhelmed substitute teacher who often cares too much for his own good. The movie is serious and heavy-handed with Brody's character often giving strong judgments that are unrealistically tolerated throughout. The actors do a fine job of portraying their characters with exception to Christina Hendricks. Hendricks character introduction is as unrealistic as I could imagine. At times the film will switch over to focus on the other teachers, presenting teaching as a thankless job and life of harassment. Overall the story is muddled and not given space to breathe. Despite the all-star cast, two young actresses steal the spotlight. Sami Gale and Betty Kaye give heartfelt performances that I wish were more expanded upon. In fact, the celebrity presence among the teaching staff serve to be distractions from the empathy we are meant to feel elsewhere. A word of warning: political bias is very present.

It moves you to a different place, somewhere far from your present hell... and you find out who you really should be. I had a good cry with this film that when I got home, I made my own paper airplanes. I pushed it as far as the wind could blow them and somehow wished that they would reach my mentors.",10.0,uleb_nieto,2006/12/02,2,2
386,Horrible Bosses 2,"Some laughs, but you can't help but feel it's a waste of a strong cast","""I hate to break it to you, but the American dream is in China."" I was a huge fan of the first film so I had some expectations for this sequel considering Christoph Waltz and Chris Pine were the new additions to an already impressive cast. What could go wrong with a comedy I had already enjoyed starring three Oscar winners? A lot when you bring in a new director whose most popular film up to now was That's My Boy. The sequel tries to bank off the success from the strong chemistry between the three lead actors (Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikis, and Charlie Day), but unfortunately the formula felt repetitive and excessive at times. As much as I enjoyed their chemistry there were some moments that felt forced this time around. I am glad they didn't repeat the same scenario from the first film and tried to change the structure of the comedy by centering on a kidnap attempt, but despite some funny scenes the sequel still falls flat by repeating some of the jokes from the first movie. Chris Pine was an excellent addition and once again the cameos from Jamie Foxx, Jennifer Aniston, and Kevin Spacey are the highlight of the film, but I was expecting a lot more from Christoph Waltz, who's an actor I highly admire. I think he could be great in this sort of comical villainous role, but he was underused here. All in all, Horrible Bosses 2 fails to deliver the same amount of laughs as the original but it still remains as a watchable and entertaining comedy. 2014 has yet to deliver a satisfying comedy, but if you're bored this is a sequel that will keep you entertained for a while. I actually found the first half of this film a bit stronger than the second half. It begins with a lot of promise introducing some of the new characters while centering on the relationship between the three amigos. Chris Pine is hilarious as well and he plays off the leads very well. There are several funny moments including the cameos with Jamie Foxx, Kevin Spacey, and Jennifer Aniston who you can tell is very uncomfortable with the dialogue she has to say but pulls it off nonetheless. The weakest part of the film is the resolution which in my opinion was a bit exaggerated, and many people might find the jokes offensive. It doesn't come close to matching the potential of the original film, but I didn't hate it either. The film is silly, but the cast makes it a worthwhile experience elevating the dull material and making it a little more fun than it had the right to be.",5.0,estebangonzalez10,2014/12/13,17,8
387,Ferris Bueller's Day Off,I too had day off to watch this Awesome flick,"This movie review by me is an attempt to improve my image in eyes of all those people who have always complained that I write movie reviews without interacting much with the reader, So here goes the review of Ferris Bueller's Dy Off keeping in mind my XI standard days of missing the school 48-times in a year. Matthew Broderick (Ferris Bueller), widely liked by everyone in his community decides to take a day off from a school. He plays hookie with his friends Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck) and Sloane Peterson (Mia Sara) and enjoys a day in Chicago. There's only one person who can stop the fun and that's the principal Ed Rooney (Jeffrey Jones). And Ferris' sister Jeanie (Jennifer Grey). OK, that's two persons. Ferris is a slacker but in his parents' eyes Ferris a perfect angel. So can Ferris get away with his plan or will he get caught? Seeking the company of his best friend Cameron to loan him his father's car which is a super sports car and the pride and joy of his father. Cameron is rather reluctant about getting his father's car but Ferris overcomes and they also take along Sloane Peterson, girlfriend of Ferris and they all head to Chicago, Illinios and have a ball going to baseball game at Wrigley Field, an expensive place to eat and visit the Art Museum. The movie is filled with some cool comic scenes involving his Principal and his witty tricks to fool people around him to get the things done in a manner he really wants. Don't miss the Greatest scene of the movie when Ferris gets up and sings TWist & ShOut by Beatles along with the parade making everyone out there dance. I admit that storyline is paper thin, and there isn't much substance that it contributes to the movie ,but at the same time we also don't want some complex storyline in a teen comedy. The dialogue for this movie has received such a following that it has even been printed on shirts and recited at parties by true fans of the film. I don't blame them. It's a classic! Afterall, JOHN HUGHES is best at this...... My Rating - 9/10",9.0,ashi-lance,2013/02/07,3,2

Through the whole movie I was just waiting for something to grab my interest, but alas, I waited in vain. Maybe if you assume it will be bad, it will be better than expected, but I thought it would be good and was pretty disappointed with the whole thing. From the jokes to the creativity of the characters and even the voices were just lacking something.

389,Goodfellas,Simply a masterpiece. Scorsese's last truly great movie (to date).,"'Goodfellas' is a masterpiece, pure and simple. While not my favourite Martin Scorsese movie it is a stunning achievement, and one of his very best movies. The film is stunning technically. The consistently fine acting by the large ensemble cast (both known and unknown), the cinematography, editing, dialogue, brilliant use of music, it's all breathtaking. But Scorsese and co-writer Mitch Pileggi never lose lose sight of their main goal - to tell a story. And in that it's really hard to beat this movie. As to the actors De Niro is on top form, Ray Liotta is the best he's ever been, and this is Joe Pesci's definitive performance. Plus you have Lorraine Bracco, Paul Sorvino, Michael Imperioli, and lots of well known faces in small but important roles (Debi Mazar, Samuel L. Jackson, Illeana Douglas, Kevin Corrigan), plus dozens of unfamiliar actors (and non-actors) who are all so good it seems unfair just to single out the ""stars"". (Also keep an eye out for Vincent Gallo in a few scenes. He has no lines, but looks cool!). 'Goodfellas' is (to date) Scorsese's last Great Movie, and one of the very best films of the 1990s. Absolutely essential viewing for any movie fan, this tremendous film is not to be missed! Highly recommended!",,Infofreak,2003/03/17,257,147
390,Blackfish,Perhaps this should be shown in all schools.,"This is harrowing. In fact, I was unable to watch it in a single viewing. If you wanted any indication of how barbaric and cruel a supposedly civilised species can behave then look no further. This makes no pretence at being an objective documentary but has a very clear message - one that is hammered home ruthlessly with footage and interviews. (Seaworld were invited to participate apparently, and declined). Magnificent, intelligent, wide roaming creatures are being relentlessly exploited for big business. On more occasions than their corporate captors seem to be prepared to admit, this results in attacks upon trainers who had been encouraged to flatter themselves that they had established a cosy relationship with normally proud creatures with entire oceans as their playground. I was soon feeling ashamed that I had taken my daughter to Seaworld, Orlando many years ago - and even more so that we had enjoyed the day and the killer whale 'show'. This soon progressed to anger that I had contributed in some small way to this business. Some reservations came in the interviews with the many 'former trainers' who had been part of the industry for so long and, presumably, made a reasonable wage in doing so. Why had they left ? When had they changed their outlook and what caused them to do so ? One former trainer even suggested that he continued training because he was concerned who would look after the captives if he didn't turn up for work....hmmmm. That aside, the accounts of the attacks and the footage of depressed, angry, possibly psychotic trapped killer whales bleeding profusely from long gashes whilst performing to thousands of paying guests was traumatic. The show must go on. Towards the end, someone in interview expressed the wish that in 50 years time we will look back on these shows in the same way that we look back on old circuses and their cruelty now. I hope that day comes sooner than that. And the reason it should be shown to schools ? Let them watch - and then decide if they want to visit. The only way it will cease is if people stop going - and it hits the corporations in the pocket. The footage of former trainers viewing Orcas in the wild was a little trite - but vividly emphasised that that is the only way they really should be viewed.",10.0,timlittle,2015/05/25,5,5
391,Horrible Bosses 2,Horrible Bosses 2,"Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikis, and Charlie Day return as the ""if it could go wrong, it normally does"" trio, now hoping to start their own business, getting manipulated by a shady business investor worth millions (Christoph Waltz), soon deciding to kidnap the son (Chris Pine; the best part about the sequel) of this unscrupulous scumbag. Pine convinces them to collaborate with him in a kidnap scenario after they decide to back out, influenced by him to agree to participate or be turned in to the cops (Jonathan Banks is the head kidnapping investigator). Pine has diabolical plans of his own and it involves screwing the trio over (of course). Get ready for countless crude jokes and profanity for profanity sake. Kevin Spacey returns as a former *horrible boss* from the previous film, still in prison and top heavy with insults and rage-singed-diatribes aimed squarely at the trio who visit him time to time for advice. Jennifer Anniston also returns as the sex-addicted boss of Day, still desperately wanting to include him in her ""cock hall of fame"". This film is certainly unafraid to posit any offensive line of dialogue into the comedy that it can muster. I thought the film tries too damn hard to make you laugh, and no matter how talented those involved might be (I realize Day has his fans, but this guy's hyper-voiced deliver grates my nerves something fierce), if the jokes flatline and the plot offers nothing clever, the dead pan and rapid-fire delivery by the actors just won't have the juice necessary to make magic happen. Pine, out of the cast, gets the best lines and shines as this devious prick who suckers the film's heroes into his masterplan to see pops dead and the inheritance all going to him. Jamie Fox is the third supporting actor to return from the previous film, getting an untraceable phone for the trio and slickly finagling his way into their situation, eyeing the five million Pine fools the trio into negotiating pops for. There's a cop car chase, gunfire (that wounds Day, leading to his coma and Anniston taking advantage of his inability to avoid her sexual contact!), and backstabbings, with the trio more often than not naïve recipients of a lot of hard luck. They just seem to always place themselves in difficult situations (the point of the comedy although their stupidity does make them look so foolish the laughs turn to pity. I think the three stars really want to make the material work and try hard, but I just found the script rather lacking. Think of how the quality deteriorated during the Hangover series and apply it to the HB sequel.",3.0,Scarecrow-88,2015/11/27,7,4
392,Goodfellas,Classic modern day gangster film,"Starting with the 1950's, we follow Henry Hill from a teen who tries to realise his dream of `always wanting to be a gangster'. He goes from running errands for Paulie Cicero to become a trusted man within his organisation. Working with James Conway and Tommy De Vito, Henry navigates his violent lifestyle where death is never more than a few steps away. For my generation this was one of our first introductions to Scorsese doing a real tour-de-force of a film - I was too young to appreciate Raging Bull and his 70's work when it first came out and the eighties were a quiet period (except the brilliant king of comedy). So here was a great introduction to a fanatastic director. The plot is spread over such a long time (in terms of story years) that it's hard to get beneath the surface events, but this is a very minor problem given that it's such a great ride. The focus is on events and the culture rather than a deep story and as such Scorsese works with set pieces and events rather than too much characterisation. However the story moves so effectively through the action - Scorsese uses long tracking shots, pumping soundtracks and scenes of building tension and sudden violence to create a masterful experience. The weakness with lack of depth is really put to the back of your mind by the action, the direction and the performances. The story is well held together by Hill's narrative and the shallowness is easily over looked. Liotta is excellent as the aspiring gangster and is full of self seeking menace. De Niro does what he does best in terms of the Irish gangster role but the standout is Pesci. Pesci gives a strong role as the vicious Tommy and deserved his Oscar. The rest of the cast are all excellent whether it's major roles (Paul Sorvino, Lorraine Bracco) or minor characters (Frank Vincent, Sivero). The real star here is Scorsese - he uses the camera and the soundtrack to great effect and gets great performances from his cast. A modern gangster feast.",,bob the moo,2002/01/30,34,20

394,Blackfish,Thought-provoking and tragic documentary,"As I watched this extremely thought-provoking documentary I was reminded of the recent film Project Nim. In the latter we were shown the tragic consequences of people deciding to bring a chimpanzee up as a human. The basic message of this incredible documentary was that if you bring a wild and dangerous animal into an artificial world populated by people, be prepared for some repercussions. Blackfish, likewise, has a very similar message. Except in this example the outcome is far worse. Not only do we see animals mistreated but some of the very people who love them most end up dead. There aren't many winners in this one. The story is underpinned by the death of a trainer. In 2010 Dawn Brancheau was killed in SeaWorld in Orlando by a killer whale called Tilikum. This in and of itself is a pretty horrible event but it's what was discovered with a little research that takes the horror up to a new level. It turned out that the same whale had in fact killed another trainer back in 1991 in very similar circumstances and had shown aggressive behaviour to trainers on other occasions. There were a few other near misses with orcas dragging trainers underwater in this water park but, worse still, there was a further killing in a park in Spain that obtained its whales from SeaWorld; whales that were the offspring of Tilikum. As if this was not appalling enough, to rub salt in the wounds, SeaWorld attempted to put the blame on the trainers, as if they were in some way responsible for their deaths. Eye witnesses were never asked for evidence in the '91 death despite their account of the tragedy conflicting with the SeaWorld version of events (incredibly, 'drowning'), while the eye witnesses in the 2010 case countered the official line from SeaWorld leading to a court case. What comes out of all of this loud and clear is that when it comes to SeaWorld, money is prioritised over the welfare of the animals and the safety of the trainers. It makes you angry and makes you wonder how these parks have not been shut down. Needless to say, SeaWorld refused to be interviewed for this documentary. These killings are terrible events but no one is blaming the orcas. These animals, who are used to roaming the oceans in large family groups which they never leave, are stuck in small pools performing tricks. It would be unusual if creatures with such highly developed brains with emotional capabilities did not develop forms of psychosis in this environment. In one very upsetting part of the film one of the female whales has her calf removed from her permanently on the basis that it was interfering with the performances for the paying public. The mother whale remained in a corner of the pool for a very long time crying out with a sound no one had ever heard before. The animal was clearly in extreme grief. Is it acceptable that people are allowed to do this to such an emotionally developed creature? We take them from the seas away from their families; surely there should be a moral responsibility? But there isn't. There is even one unpleasant moment from 1970 captured on film where a calf is captured and removed from its family. The other orcas did not flee, they hung around and cried. It was pretty awful and even one of the hunters was traumatised by this event. This is a film that really should be seen. Particularly if you are thinking of taking a trip to see the performing killer whales and those dedicated folks who work with them.",9.0,Red-Barracuda,2013/07/27,48,43
395,Horrible Bosses 2,"Everything I loved about the first, without being horribly ""meta"".","I loved it. I cracked up nearly the entire time, even though my husband next to me wasn't quite as amused. But he liked the first one slightly more. I guess we just have different tastes. Anyway, if you enjoyed the first one, I swear this isn't one of those comedy sequels that spends the whole time going ""hey, remember our last movie and how we did this one thing and it was funny? Right? Remember that joke?"" (22 Jump Street being one example). Yes, HB2 makes some shout-outs to the first movie. Duh, it's a sequel. But it's nowhere near annoying, in my opinion. The story is funny and *mostly* believable, and to me that's good enough for a comedy. The cast is still just as on the ball as they were in the first, and I even found their chemistry better this time. Those 3 men work wonderfully together, and when you add in Chris Pine it becomes even more hilarious. Plus several other great names. In summary, I found myself breathless with laughter during about 90% of this movie, and to me that makes it absolutely worth the ticket. I plan to buy it the day it comes out.",9.0,blarglznoflo,2014/11/28,71,38

Sam Rockwell isn't sure whether to play it for laughs or not, leaving us with a performance that Simon Pegg would have been annoyed to not to have been considered for. I was left confused over why most of the events and actions occurred due to the complete illogicality of Rockwells' behaviour and ridiculous premise.

397,Crash,Hard To Swallow,"It's good emotional stuff at the time, but the very real weaknesses nag at you as soon as the film ends. It's a real fader. After a month you've forgotten all about it. Once there's some distance from the emotion, I have to say that it sucks. Issues are isolated and blown out of proportion just to give an immediate emotional intensity. There is a lack of reality, intelligence, craft and creativity about the whole thing. And I found the racist, sex abusing cop's back story of being a dutiful son and then being a dramatic hero somewhat hard to swallow - after the event. Yeah, sure, at the time it felt like there was some significance there, but on reflection you see that it was just a dramatic scene in a Hollywood movie. And any suggestion that even a racist can also be nice to his mom is not worth making, except by racists to excuse and justify racist behaviour. The confusions you feel at the time are the result of some blunt emotional exploitation by the movie makers. It's like a series of big expensive, well made adverts strung together, some saying vote conservative and some saying vote liberal. At the time the adverts seem to be saying something. But by the next day real issues and real life take over and you return to reality.",3.0,SilkTork,2005/11/08,25,17

399,The Chorus,A moving film that puts a smile on your face.,"""The Chorus"" takes place in post-war France as boys were placed in boarding schools that were places of both repression and refuge. What I liked most about this film was Clement Mathieu, a failed musician who takes a job as supervisor in the prison-like school, and his attitude towards a group of unfortunate and misunderstood young boys. He treated them with the utmost respect and believed that each one possessed a special gift or talent they could show the world. Two ideas I found interesting were the importance of the children's needs of fathers in their lives is explored in this film. This idea can be easily accepted because of how quickly the children began to have respect for their instructor. His kindness toward the children is returned to him by the students, as they respond to the way he teaches music to motivate and interest them. The children's affection was demonstrated after their instructor was fired by tossing goodbye letters out of the window as he walked away from the school. Another interesting idea was how the colors in the film set the mood for the audience. For example, to allow the feeling of transformation within the school, the color goes from grays, to bold and bright colors towards the end. Not only does this type of detail help set the mood, but also allows the audience to feel as if they were one of students in the film. A couple of things that were particularly French were the food that the children were served, and the principle's (Rachin) attitude of sincerity and outspokenness. The music, which was created by the film director, gives the film the right tone. It has such a sweetness to it that it disarms us and gets us into the right mood for enjoying it even more. The acting was very outstanding, simple, and comical at times, especially from Clement. The children were very sweet, especially the very little Pepinot. The director, Christophe Barratier, began his career as a classical guitarist, winning several international competitions. In 1991 he joined Galatee Films, where he was an associate producer on several movies, including ""Winged Migration (2001). He then directed his first short, Les Tombales (2002). He next wrote, directed and composed the music for his first film ""The Chorus"" (2005).

He really seems like he's been alone on the moon for 3 years. When compared to something like Matt Damon in The Martian, the difference is staggering. Spacey as GERTY is also a nice bonus. The plot is very interesting and complex but not convoluted. Clint Mansell's score is one of my favorites in recent memory and fits the movie perfectly, and the special effects are well executed. Most importantly, the movie is so emotional with some deep and interesting themes.

402,The Wailing,A mystery puzzle,"Impressive mystical build-up. Not only are the characters, the scenery, the acting founded in a story, where people are real. Writer & director Hong-jin Na, gives a powerful view of the dangers surrounding a world of shamans, evil spells, leaving viewers and protagonist Jong-goo (the policeman) in a maze of ignorance, toward a parallel world, only understood or presumably understood by people with special insights. There is an ongoing debate about the conclusion or understanding of the movie, none of them right or wrong, and that is exactly the point, the film offers a view in a world of mysticism, where events can be reversed or take an unexpected turn. The understanding comes with, how you choose to put these events together, giving them purpose. Here is the way I have chosen to put events together, giving some sort of understanding of this chilling drama. (reading on will spoil the fun,if you haven't seen the movie yet) Moving to the middle of the movie, the shaman Il-gwang wants to cast a deadly hex, (death spell) towards the presumed evil shaman, the Jap. Il-gwang states clearly to Jong-goo, that this evil shaman is a master of evil, and that drinking, having intercourse or anything resembling vulnerable behavior, may disrupt the casted hex and make it backfire. In my opinion, that is exactly the key, making events and spells spiral out of control. The father and policeman Jong-goo, can't watch while his daughter screams in agony, while Il-gwang is performing the hex. Going against the shaman's clear instructions, Jong-goo stops Il-gwang in the middle of casting the hex, and the deadly spell backfires. Not only does the Jap survive the attack, but Il-gwang turns evil, thus the result of the reversing hex. Another side effect on reversing the hex, is that instead of killing, the hex is then sent toward the dead corpse in the car reviving it, setting him of as a bodyguard for the Jap (evil strategic thinking) while he is recovering. Once turning the good shaman Il-gwang to the evil side, the Jap secludes himself from sight, by staging his own death, Jong-goo thinking he has killed the Jap in a truck accident. Il-gwang faces the mysterious woman, who now protects Jong-goo's family, and starts bleeding out the nose and vomiting fiercely, he flees under attack until he reaches the boarders of her powers (when the bug hallucinations stop). Back at the house Jong-goo faces the mysterious woman, who tells him not to go back to the house until the rooster has crowed three times. Il-gwang (now in the devil's league) tells Jong-goo not to trust her over the cellphone. The father and policeman losing faith, (impossible for Jong-goo and us for that matter, to see what is what at this stage) returns to his house before the roosters third crow and finds his wife and mother in law dead. Thus, the protecting spell of the mysterious woman is broken (her use and powers now indifferent) giving Il-gwang the opportunity to return and take the pictures of Jong-goo's slain family. Ultimately the movie offers a puzzle, whether you want to solve it your own way or demanding it be solved for you, before you leave the theater, is a matter of temper. For me personally it was a thrill to be challenged by writer & director Hong-jin Na, giving me a lot to think about (thus giving the movie 10). The best part of this puzzle is that it can be solved in many ways, this was just one of many. M.R.",10.0,myscreenwriter,2017/07/29,28,13

405,Ferris Bueller's Day Off,Farris Bueller's Day Off,"In the 1986 film, ""Farris Bueller's Day Off"", one determined teenager pushes every limit to the max, with his sites set on the goal of having the day off from his own form of prison, high school. Farris is the ultimate wise guy. He outsmarts everyone who may potentially get in his way of skipping school. And, while doing so, creates many laughs for the audience along the way. This film incorporates great acting along with an entertaining plot that makes for a great comedy, just maybe not one for all ages. It seems as though every character was hand picked to perfectly fill their part. Matthew Broderick has the complete package for his role as the main character, Farris Bueller. His performance captures the essence of the crazy, free-spirited teenager who just wants to live life to the fullest. Starring alongside Broderick is Alan Ruck, or better known as Ferris's best friend, Cameron Frye. Ruck's drone voice and tense facial expressions mimic the characteristics of the up-tight personality his character is supposed to represent. Together the two actor's juxtaposition and spectacular performances make for a hilarious comedy of pranks and lies. Though the film will produce many laughs, my hope would be that those laughs are produced only from the mouths of those 14 and up. The plot is centered around lies that snowball throughout the storyline. At first it's one little lie, and then one more, until it seems as though it is the only dialogue being used. Younger children may process the message of this film to be finding it acceptable behavior to skip school, lie to their parents and authority figures, and steal a car with ultimately no consequences. But, these over-the-top lies and inflated situations are what make for such an amusing plot. With that being said, the film is rated PG-13 mostly for its language. Swear words flow loosely from the lips of some of the young characters. But, then again, the dialogue is part of what makes the movie so funny. The smarta** kids, the monotone teacher, and the naïve parents are all needed to add cohesion to the piece. Director John Hughes seems to stay in his line of fire with this movie, filming the different perspectives of life viewed from the rebellious, love stricken teenagers, as he does in his other timeless films, ""The Breakfast Club"" (1985) and ""Sixteen Candles"" (1984). Though Hughes doesn't incorporate any flashy special effects or amazing scenery in the film, it isn't needed. It allows the audience to focus on, and enjoy, the classic story of the young man who fakes sick to skip school and, in turn, makes the best out of his ""free"" day. If you are looking for a good laugh from a classic movie, it should be a must see on your list.",9.0,laurenvoelker,2013/02/19,3,2
406,Intermission,cynical in right dose,"it is a not soft exercise of honesty. smart script, great cast and a lot of events. dark humor and a classic story about basic values and their price. more than cynical picture of characters lives, it is a bitter story who remember the best pages of American literature. because the frustrations, the desires, the search of happiness, the horrible job and the taste of freedom are sides of same need of sense. and the science to transform all in a seductive labyrinth, who remember many others, to impose not a fantastic end but the normal solution with its delicate flavor of perfect circle are virtues of a movie who remains a challenge or, maybe, an experience. if it is an experience, the whole guilt is result of extraordinary cast job.",,Vincentiu,2014/07/10,0,0
407,Moon,A good film.,"Moon is about a future where the majority of mans power comes from harvesting the rocks on the moon and tells the tale of Sam Bell who has almost finished his three-year contract working there. The acting is probably the best and most distinct part of this film. Sam Rockwell is practically the only actor in the entire hour and forty minutes and shows so many sides to this Sam Bell its captivating to watch. The film looks the part. Its not revolutionary, its pretty much classic space station. There were some gorgeous shots of the moon though, the monochrome grey and long shadows very effectively created a sense of cold and isolation. The pacing was off. There was no real suspense leading up to the turning point and the way they dealt with the aftermath was predictable and boring. Granted, new ideas are difficult to come by, so there's nothing wrong with re-using some old one - only it's got to be done better. Moon has taken so much from other films but just hasn't added anything new or different or interesting. Moon is a good film but would be much better if you had nothing to compare it to.",6.0,very_evil_me,2009/07/13,37,20

409,Moon,Throughly Engaging,"When I first heard of this from commentators, it was along on the lines good effort from first time feature director, Duncan Jones, son of David Bowie. When I did finally come to watch it, this is not a good effort, this is a masterpiece. Not just a good compact script but Sam Rockwell delivering a blistering performance as Sam Bell, a technician living and working in isolation maintaning a Helium 3 mining facility on the moon, with the only real time communication is GERTY (Kevin Spacey), the ROBOT companion. With the help of a bizarre event involving Sam crashing his lunar rover, the truth of his existence dawns upon him as he nears the end of his 3 year contract. What can I say, this is just a good simple and meaningful storyline. And it does not pay homage to sci-fi flicks of the 70s/80s as Duncan Jones the director explains. It's in a class of it's own. It's amazing the director pulled this off on such a small budget, but perhaps, the lack of money for too many effects gives it the edge.",10.0,carsick_carl,2010/01/30,24,12
410,Ferris Bueller's Day Off,Ferris Bueller's Day Off = Exceptional,"""Bueller?... Bueller?... Bueller?"" Every teenager dreams of skipping school and Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick) does just that. In this 1986 teenage comedy, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, a not so innocent teenager nearing the end of his high school career, ditches school and, with best friend Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck) and girlfriend Sloane Peterson (Mia Sara), embark on an adventure to the ""Windy City"" of Chicago. With the upcoming obstacles of college, Bueller plans a day of shenanigans in hopes of saving Cameron. Little does Bueller know that his sister, Jeanie Bueller (Jennifer Grey), and principal Ed Rooney (Jeffrey Jones) would do everything in their power to make sure that the so called ""perfect"" child would be caught red-handed. Jeanie Bueller and Principal Ed Rooney didn't expect that catching the famous Ferris Bueller was going to be easier said than done. Along the way, they themselves dig into deeper trouble, even with the law! Running through neighbor's yards, encountering a gruesome rottweiler, and maybe even a little romance with a young, troubled teen (Charlie Sheen). What else could possibly go wrong? Throughout this movie, it is hard for anyone to despise Ferris. His young, seemingly childish attitude that never gets him in trouble appeals to everyone. He never ceases to address the audience with a sarcastic, funny side note as if we are apart of his scheme. By the end of this movie, the audience will see Ferris develop on so many levels. He even goes as far as taking the blame for something he didn't do, even if that means being caught. Matthew Broderick comes through with his best performance to date. Although Cameron, much more reserved than Bueller, is a bit skeptical of Bueller's mischief, he slowly warms up to the idea of fun and even does the unexpected. Yet throughout this movie he never seems to wear more than three expressions. It's not until the end that the audience sees the true Cameron that has been bottled up. Will his father ever open his heart to his son? Sloane Peterson plays the perfect girl for the wild and unpredictable Ferris Bueller. She's able to keep Ferris in check and temporarily out of trouble, yet she still plays along with his shenanigans. Together they balance out to the perfect high school relationship. John Hughes, director of the famous ""16 Candles"" and ""The Breakfast Club,"" adds another memorable and comedic piece to his repertoire. Through the cultivation of every teenager's dream and the development of these characters, John Hughes certainly delivers. Anyone looking for countless laughs should indulge in this one of a kind teenage comedy.",10.0,maurer94,2013/02/18,11,7

It portrays a sober viewing of a corrupt attorney, his beliefs and how fundamentally nothing is ever clear. It's thrilling and nuanced. The plot might be straightforward but it's blurred lines make the movie ooze an atmosphere of complexity. The actors make the movie, and especially to the leads Richard Gere, Laura Linney and Edward Norton who present multi-faceted characters with such depth and deft. The backdrop of corruption, politics and murder interweave with the movie's central themes to present a film about morality and injustice. The plot paces well and the ending levels it out with a startling climax. I enjoyed Primal Fear, I liked the depth and how detailed each scene displays to the audience. It's an excellent crime thriller that deserves your attention.",9.0,sonicheze8,2019/03/04,5,4
412,Horrible Bosses 2,"Flimsy sequel, not as effective when not as inspired as the first time round","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning The put upon trio return, this time tired of getting it in the beck from bullying superiors, and deciding to go it alone and set up their own company, though having little to no idea how to do it. In order to secure funding, they approach hot shot entrepreneur Bert Hanson (Christoph Waltz), and his obnoxious son Rex (Chris Pine), who seem pretty decent, only to unscrupulously rip them off. The threesome must then try and claw back what's theirs, along the way clashing with their old nemeses from the last film. Regardless of how much I may have individually enjoyed it, I am aware the original Horrible Bosses film opened to only marginally good reviews and certainly made nowhere near as much of an impact as the similarly themed buddy comedy The Hangover, despite having just as inspired an idea. So a sequel is a surprising offering, if nothing else. With all the surviving characters from the last film present, and a few strategically designed new ones to add on, it's a hollow, pretty desperate affair that suffers from being naturally less inspired than it's predecessor. We open with a laborious, overly drawn out and pretty tiresome break in sequence at an apartment complex, which sets the tone for the rest of the film. Kevin Spacey and Jennifer Aniston reprise their respective psychotic boss roles from the first film, but both fail to really fit in with the narrative structure of the film, and their roles feel really inconsequential to the film. It just takes the edgy, irreverent humour of the first film and basically rehashes it all, only to notably less funny effect. This is a pleasant surprise in existence, but in execution it's almost inevitable weaknesses are there for all to see, which is a bit of a catch 22 for lovers of the first film, evasive as we are. **",4.0,davideo-2,2014/12/03,34,14

Yes I loved it however there were things in the book I think should have been in the movie. That's why I give it a 9 not a 10! Now the reason I'm writing this review, this movie is sad. It promises to be sad just by the decription and the trailer. Looking at the cover tells you that it's going to be romantic. If you do not like these types of movies or you are a heartless bonehead like the guy that gave this heartfelt movie a 1 and wishes he could have given a 0, do not watch this movie. My fiancé put it right, this movie (and book) is The Notebook on steroids! You will cry.You will get mad at the crying because it won't stop.

414,Crash,Completely Contrived,"This movie was so bad. The locksmith's role was well acted and of course Don Cheadle was good as was Matt Dillon. But please...the rest of the roles were so overacted probably because of the sensationalized writing style. To think that each of the characters were connected in some way is putting the ""Hollywood spin"" on a ludicrous concept. Brendan Frazer was miserable. To the amateur movie watcher, this was a great film. Give me a break. Anyone can yell and scream or write a movie where every scene is about racism. I felt like I was watching one scene from twelve separate movies. De-Hollywood the dialog and make twelve different movies around each of the scene.

415,Crash,Crash: Drama for dummies,"This is a good movie if you are the type of person who needs everything spelled out for you, be taught moral lessons and have political statements preached to you. Obnoxiously slapping the audience in the face with its self-righteousness in every scene, Crash manages to be become the only film to which I have 'awarded' the lowest score to on IMDb: 2/10. I can't even believe how terrible this film is. I don't even know what the 2 is for because no redeeming aspects come to mind as I write this. The content is racism, if that wasn't clear enough. The events in the film are all shadowed by racial prejudice. The characters are all of different races. All people ever talk about in the film is racism. They do not talk about it casually as a means to make the dialog believable or accessible but whatever is said are readily-made, perfectly-crafted speeches on racist issues that sound like they've been taken from an opinion column in a political magazine. So Crash drills these things into your head at all times, thereby cheapening its message -- which is, essentially, that racism is bad and that we stereotype based on race (0/10 for originality!). Ironically, what is most disturbing about the film is not the racial stereotypes that are present, but that American audiences NEED to be told these things and need such obvious morals to be spelled out for them and need a guy like Haggis shaking their finger at them telling you that is bad behaviour. This fills me with concern for the intelligence of the average movie-goer. After all, how can you applaud a film that states the obvious? The icing of the cake of a dreadful film for me was the scene in which the little cutesy Latina girl is 'shot', trying to protect her father (Hispanic guy whose name I cannot recall as the only thing that is put forward in Crash is a person's race). As she jumps in front of her father to take the bullet for him there is THE cheesiest most ""sorrowful"" score imaginable playing loudly and the American flag blowing in the wind in the background of the shot. This scene is one of the worst, cheapest in film history. Who can honestly sit and watch that with a straight face? I can only assume that the big budget of Crash was spent on late night taco-runs as nothing of substance is presented to us. Offensively poor writing, contrived performances, endless clichés make this simply an unwatchable film. To call it manipulative is giving it too much credit as that implies the clever disguise of intentions and messages and Crash does not even try to disguise anything -- it just preaches. 2/10",2.0,Flagrant-Baronessa,2006/07/20,147,85

417,The Chorus,A Simple and Uncomplicated Masterpiece,What a beautiful little film that is engaging and enchanting from the very first scene. Even the harshness of life in a correctional boarding school is treated with simplicity without resorting to gratuitous violence. Gerard Jugnot delivers an excellent portrait of a school prefect who has no great talent other than a humanity and devotion to the students under his care. History shows that this ordinary individual has a talent for spotting genius in others and by the conclusion of the film we are exuberant at the rounding off of each theme and character. I defy anyone not to have a tear running down their cheek at some stage of this film. It tugs at the heart strings and is uplifting at the same time. In particular the two final scenes warrant special attention and acclaim. The view of tiny little hands all saying their own farewell is one of the most moving scenes I have seen in any movie. Les Choristes truly deserves wide acclaim and the sacrifice made by Gerard Jugnot in helping finance the film is a credit to his belief in this script and a reward for delivering such a wonderful family film. This film restores a balance to humanity and highlights the dignity of ordinary human beings and the hope we all have for happiness and to leave our mark on the world.,10.0,tisserand62,2007/12/30,5,5
418,Interstellar,Got tricked by paid reviews,"I watched this movie yesterday. I was very excited after reading so many perfect 10 star reviews for this movie so I was expecting a perfect movie, really! Before I continue, I must say I really love sci-fi movies, and I am deeply interested in black holes, time travel, wormholes, interstellar traveling. Wow, I couldn't think twice, this could be the perfect fit for me! I had really high expectations. For the entire movie I was feeling like: ""the best part of the movie should soon"", but never came. I had hard time understanding what was really happening, and too many minutes of the movie were badly wasted in dramatic scenes of love, confusing speeches, formulas. All I wanted to see was the wormhole travel, spacetime and gravity distortion, galaxies, nebulae, etc. I mean, I wanted to see what is in the deep space, and what could be human life in a planet million light years away from us. SPOILERS AHEAD Maybe the movie drove me nuts, or I lost interest, but after they crossed into the new galaxy, all I felt was confusion. I never understood what was really happening, what were they rescuing, what were those 3 planets and how they knew too much about them, why was there a black hole? Even I tried hard connecting every scene and plot in the movie, I failed. What I disliked the most was the fact that the feeling of discovering something AMAZING and new was not successfully transmitted to us. I wanted to feel that great emotion of discovering deeps space but I failed. Instead the characters talked about crazy physics and plans to save humanity. Not to mention the multi-plot scenes after the fight, totally no sense. Please don't get tricked by this website and fake reviews ad I did. This is reason I signed up at IMDb (first review), to warn others. The idea of the movie is fantastic, but poorly developed and acted, totally confusing, too much cliché.

The only one who was funny was Kevin Spacey, and he was in the film for about three minutes. Otherwise, it made you long for the subtle and clever humor of the Ritz Brothers. Jason Bateman gamely tries to hold the thing together, but both Jason Sudeikis and Charlie Day play characters who are just too stupid to remember to breathe and the dull script thinks plugging in a few outrageous concepts without humor makes comedy.

I normally hate Colin because he is a fairy in general but he's OK in this movie. There were two plot lines in this movie-= one about a kid who throws rocks through windshields of moving vehicles and the other about a woman with a moustache. Let's face it- this movie has no freaking idea of what it wanted to say or where it wanted to go. THe characters story lines intertwine on some levels but are in no means worthy of being included in a script. The whole thing is weak and pointless and then there is an occasional OK scene.

The story is about Count Dracule trying to raise his only child safe and sound away from terrifying humans and invites all the monsters to his hotel to relax and celebrate his very young daughter's 118th birthday which is accompanied by a surprise visitor! This is a really funny movie with a simple predictable story line and tons of characters that you will love.

You will be moved by it like few times before. That I guarantee. But aside from all the 'don't go to Sea World' feeling, Blackfish is about our relationship with nature, our poor knowledge of animal behavior and the levels of cruelty we exact on other species and even our own just for fun and profit. The footage is absolutely disturbing, with interviews from former Sea World trainers and witnesses to some unfortunate accidents, along with real footage of things gone so horribly wrong you wonder how nobody before dared to challenge Sea World and similar theme parks for their total disrespect towards animals and human beings. But at the same time you get a wider sense of awareness of our own society, and you can't help but think this is the way our corporate world deals with everything, from client service to human and animal lives. You know you've seen animal abuse documentaries before, but this one is about us as a negligent race and it's presented in a way that hits so hard it's immoral not to start caring. There are some scenes here that will crawl deep into your thoughts and dreams and, if you consider yourself a sensitive person, they won't let go for a long time. But other than just feeling this deep sense of rage and humbleness, I think it's time to take some matters at hand and, first of all, stop allowing yourself to 'ignore' these kind of things.

The greatest film ever? Excuse me, this is a feature film that says nothing, depicts no authentic feelings or character development, is grossly self-indulgent and filled with idiotically implausible situations, such as people firing powerful handguns repeatedly, simultaneously and then hanging around chatting as if nobody would ever report the firing and summon the law. Perhaps the most implausible character of all is played by Mr Tarantino, who shouts at the two hoodlum killers as if they were playmates from school and complains that his wife will divorce him if she returns from work to find a car in the garage containing a man with his head blown off. Where is the moral compass of the people who revere this schoolboy nonsense? Nobody in the film is remotely principled, and nor is anyone (except possibly the pawnbroker) actually evil. The scene where he releases a leather-studded sadist from a cage is possibly the most unbelievable rubbish ever deployed in a Hollywood feature. ""It's only entertainment,"" I hear people protest.

However, the real footage of these dangerous encounters are truly eye opening. If a documentary is suppose to bring something to a wider discussion, this one has done that for me. I could never bring anybody to see the show at Sea World. In many ways, these are like a tiger, lion, or a bear in a circus. It has dangers, but orcas travel much further and they're much bigger.

430,Blackfish,Blackfish is a chilling documentary that can't be always full explained but it is nothing short of amazing.,"Founded in 1964 by Milton C. Shedd, Ken Norris and David DeMott, Sea World was the newest theme park attraction in the 60's. It was a theme park attraction that was different for the 60's and even now due to it's marine life theme. From it's popular roller coaster Kraken in Orlando, Florida to the Madagascar Live! Operation:Vacation show in San Diego, California, this points to why Sea World is so successful. That said, Blackfish by CNN is made for the whole world to show us what is underneath the surface of this company and some of their wrongdoings. Blackfish makes it's main points through Tilikum the 12,000 pound killer whale who has had 21 offspring and has helped make Sea World successful but has also been responsible for three deaths. Tilikum is a whale that has put his mark on Sea World and now will always define it. Through the use of nets and hooks, Tilkum was wrongfully captured off the cost of Iceland in 1983. I don't think there is anyway a whale or any other type of marine animal for that matter should be taken away from a place where they grew up or where their family is and taken to a Sea World park. It is like taking a human being out of their house and putting them in far away place without any hope of ever getting back. To learn information about Tilikum, we see interviews with the former trainers of this whale. These are great and informative interviews that show the power, love and intelligence of this whale. They also point to more of Sea World's wrongdoings. The biggest point Blackfish makes is about the deaths caused by Tililkum that we do see through some scary scenes. One involved a 1991 incident with the trainer Keltie Byrne, another is a strange 1999 incident that involved Daniel Dukes and also an incident in 2010 involving the now well- known trainer, Dawn Brancheau. Afterwards, you cannot look at this large mammal the same but also there are many holes in place in these stories. Where was security in the Daniel Dukes incident where he got in the Tilikum's tank? Dawn Brancheau's story has obviously been covered up many times by Sea World. There is a lot interesting information out there that we really still need to learn. Also included in this film, are some fun commercials from Sea World. We see a family from Detroit from the 90's doing a promotion, a first time baby whale shown in 1994 and it's fun to look back at this. We also learn about whales' brain which was unexpected. It's the little things like this shows off some Sea World nostalgia and you can see that director Gabriela Cowperthwaite has done her homework. Blackfish is one-sided but it is a film we need. It is great for what it tells us and it's effect on us. Frankly, nothing in this will want to make you go back to Sea World again. Blackfish is a chilling documentary that can't be always full explained but it is nothing short of amazing. Even though it is a documentary, Blackfish is still no doubt one of the top films of 2013.",10.0,alexcomputerkid,2013/11/10,20,17
431,Ferris Bueller's Day Off,Ferris Bueller is an asshole.,"Being a big fan of high school/coming-of-age movies, I had high expectations from this film. Everyone says it's one of the best coming-of-age comedies out there, and it's maintained that title for nearly 3 decades now. The movie starts off very promising, immediately setting itself apart from a sea of derivative titles in the coming-of-age comedy genre, with its rather original protagonist. Most conventional high school films are about an unpopular kid's rise to popularity despite numerous challenges, popular kids bullying and rejecting them, etc. Ferris Bueller, on the other hand, is already popular. He's handsome. He's got a girlfriend. All the things that the protagonist has at the end of most high school movies, Ferris Bueller starts his day off with. However, I now understand why kids like him are usually the villain, because Ferris Bueller is just an unbelievable asshole. He fakes sickness to get out of school, something we've all done and can relate to, but then he drags his actually sick friend, Cameron, out of bed using all kinds of manipulation, not because he enjoys hanging out with him, but because he needs a ride. He then pressures Cameron to steal his dad's Ferrari, drives to school with the henceforth stressed-out Cameron to pick up his girlfriend, effectively turning him into the third wheel for the remainder of the day. In fact, they barely talk to the guy from that point. Oh, and he doesn't return the car after all this, instead he drives recklessly for a while, to yet further worried protest from Cameron that goes ignored, then takes it to a garage and hands the keys to a random guy (who also proceeds to drive recklessly with it). He then spends the rest of day doing the weirdest crap. He could drive around in the Ferrari for example, or go do drugs or smoke or drink like normal kids do when they skip school, or maybe use his popularity and his confidence to get Cameron a girl as well, but instead he uses his day off to dine at a fancy restaurant and go to a museum. What high school kid ditches school to go to museum? Oh, and apparently he is so popular, that he can use his citywide influence to be the star of a whole parade. I'm all for the anti-hero approach to the otherwise over-told high school story, but Ferris Bueller is not a good anti-hero. You can't relate to him and you don't root for him, except only when the school principal develops a strange obsession with exposing Ferris Bueller's whole plan, and only then because the principal is an even bigger asshole. The story is mostly not so believable, and none of the characters are very layered or developed. From the weirdly adult choice of entertainment, to the variety of strange and hardly believable events that unfold, such as the principal's obsession, or Cameron entering a catatonic state at some point, to the parade scene, the film feels like a collection of random events sparsely unfolding between a lot of silence or uninteresting/unfunny dialog. A big portion of the film is just kinda awkward. In my opinion, what makes most teenage movies great, is how relatable they are to all of us, and to our own adolescent experiences. As teenagers they helped us get through our own lives and as adults they make us laugh at who we used to be. In my opinion, Ferris Bueller's Day Off fails in this regard. Maybe if I was myself still a teenager, or kind of an asshole, I would appreciate this film more. To its credit it doesn't look like it's a movie that hasn't aged well, though that would at least explain why such a bad movie is so highly spoken of.",4.0,aryafsharm,2015/09/24,164,90

436,Hotel Transylvania,Count me among those who thought the movie was surprisingly good,"After reading reviews that either disliked or were indifferent to Hotel Transylvania and being dubious because Adam Sandler(who has been in a lot of really bad movies recently) was in the lead role, I was unsure of whether to see the film. But my love for animation and the appetising trailer over-rode my doubts and I saw it anyway. And you know what, while The Pirates and ParaNorman were better animated movies from this year in my opinion I found Hotel Transylvania much better than expected. More could have been done with the relationship between Jonathan and Mavis, it is a romantic angle that has been used many times before and as well as feeling somewhat under-baked very little new was done with it. While a vast majority of the film is fast-paced with no real dull spots, some parts of the film did feel rushed. On the other point of view, the animation is excellent, the backgrounds are both beautiful and Gothic and that is the same with the colours. The characters are well-modelled. The soundtrack is catchy and upbeat, though some of the songs could have been more than just snippets. The writing is zany and often witty with a surprising amount of heart also. The story is predictable, but not dull. It has a number of great moments, the genre references are not as inspired as they were in ParaNorman but they are fun to spot, and I loved a lot of the slapstick-in-style gags. Especially the zombie Beethoven, the scream cheese Hors-D'Oeuvres, the shrunken heads do not disturb tags and the digs at Twilight(much more fulfilling than any of the movies combined). But it does have a lot of heart. Is the over-protective father idea clichéd? Of course. But I did find it genuinely touching instead of overly-exaggerated as I have seen described. Dracula's past is also shown in a darkly emotional way. The characters are not the most memorable I have ever seen, but they do have their likability, my favourite here was Dracula. And the voice acting was surprisingly great, to me from a non-fan who has liked him in some movies(Punch Drunk Love, Reign Over Me, Spanglish and Happy Gilmore) and hated him in others(Jack and Jill, Going Overboard, Zookeeper and Mr Deeds) Adam Sandler gives one of his better performances of late in the role of Dracula, he is actually funny as well as emotive in alternative to irritating. Selena Gomez is endearing as daughter Mavis and Adam Samberg brings some heroism to Jonathan. Kevin James, David Spade, Jon Lovitz, Fran Drescher and especially Steve Buscemi give solid support. In conclusion, surprisingly good. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,TheLittleSongbird,2012/10/27,79,56
437,October Sky,Great family movie,"This is a touching story about a bunch of boys who get inspired to build rockets. I added this movie to my watch list for Octoberween (I try to watch Halloween related or spooky movies). Spoiler alert this movie has nothing to do with Halloween, it seems to take place in the fall the title has October in it but didn't give off any kind of Halloween vibe (was hoping for a chill drama that would fit my specifications). This is a great story about Homer, his friends and his family and the trials and tribulations they face while Homer pursues his dream of building rockets. Great acting all around, with some very touching moments between characters. Very wholesome, no swearing or violence but there is some death in there. Overall a movie I would add to my rewatch list.",8.0,Mcduff3601,2018/10/10,2,2

439,October Sky,"""You don't give up, do you?""","A high school boy's fascination with the Russian Sputnik missile fostered a life long love of rocketry and outer space travel. ""October Sky"" tells that story of Homer Hickam and his boyhood friends who achieved a level of notoriety in the small town of Coalwood, West Virginia in the late 1950's. The film is inspiring in it's message of believing in yourself and following one's dreams, even in the face of widespread ridicule and family opposition. Homer (Jake Gyllenhaal) and his friends Roy Lee (William Lee Scott), O'Dell (Chad Lindberg) and Quentin (Chris Owen) join forces to develop their own personal answer to the country's space program by repeatedly trying and failing to build a successful rocket, until their perseverance is finally rewarded with a successful launch that amazes even them. A palpable sense of family tension is present throughout however, as Homer's dad expects his son to follow in his footsteps as a home town coal miner. He treats Homer differently from older brother Jim (Scott Thomas), who's athletic ability stands to earn him a college football scholarship, one of the few ways out for a graduating teen growing up in a town with no prospects of it's own. John Hickam (Chris Cooper) doesn't come around to Homer's way of thinking until the very end of the story when the young man's accomplishments earn recognition for himself, his 'Rocket Boys' team, and his high school. And as often is the case, there's a stellar teacher on hand to support the pursuit of knowledge for it's own sake. For Homer, it's Miss Riley (Laura Linney), stricken at an early age with Hodgkins lymphoma, but undeniably a supporter who's belief in Homer puts her in direct conflict with the school principal and it's Board of Ed. I thought it quite interesting that a marquee at a local movie house in the picture was featuring ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"", a B grade sci-fi flick of the era. I think if you watch that film, you'll find it to be a whole lot better than it would have any right to be based on it's title. In a way, it's diametrically opposite to Homer's goal of reaching for the stars, as it's main character is faced with a dilemma of growing smaller and smaller on a daily basis. At first horrified by that prospect he eventually comes to terms with his plight and endeavors to adapt to a life that brings him new challenges on a daily basis. Any sense of closure for the viewer is left to one's own imagination, a rather daring concept for a film of any genre to propose back in the Fifties. Reading some of the other reviews for the film on this site, it's not surprising to see how many others got misty eyed over the relationship between Homer and his father. The father/son dynamic is one that affects me in similar ways in movies like this, as one looks back over one's life, it's comforting to reflect on those good times that overcame any difficulties. Coming from humble beginnings, I'm sure young men like Homer and his buddies never forgot their roots and where they came from, knowing that their experience might some day inspire others to reach for the stars themselves. One last thought - the title 'October Sky' is a perfect anagram of 'Rocket Boys' - how cool is that?",8.0,classicsoncall,2018/04/28,2,2

443,Hotel Transylvania,Having Fun with The Monsters,"It feels pretty good when people take an old story and put a fresh spin on it. ""Transylvania"" is a great new entry in the world of animation movies, a genre that has been thriving for the most part in the last couple of decades. In the new film, Count Dracula and to a certain extent, some of his monster peers discover that family life can a bit stressful. That's in addition to having to deal with centuries of problems with humans. Things get so bad that Dracula builds a ""resort"" where misunderstood creatures can find peace and protection from the rest of the world. It also helps him deal with his 118 year old daughter. It all appears to be working until one day, an adventurous human soul wanders into the castle, and things become even more complicated for all parties involved. Soon, we have Dracula trying to contain the damage, keep up appearances, and eventually trying some unorthodox methods to solve his problem. The film, like ""Paranormal"" earlier this year shows plenty of heart, tolerance and has us entertained throughout the movie. In fact, the film remembers to bring in music, comedy, and some sharp and clever dialogue. There is plenty of vocal talent in the film, all contributing a bit to the overall effect. Kevin James, Sandler, Drescher, and Gomez are among the standouts. ""Hotel Transylvania"" deserves plenty of recognition, and most importantly, should be enjoyed.",9.0,aharmas,2012/09/30,8,5

Suffering from insomia, he descends into insanity after coming across a teen prostitute and its aftermath. Simply brilliant story with stellar performance by Robert de Niro who is probably at his best with this.

446,Detachment,"An Excellent, eyes opening movie","Detachment – CATCH IT (A-) I think it was about time to have the movie about the teachers, and not like Cameron Diaz's Bad Teacher but a realistic approach to the teacher's problem facing the new generation. Who thinks they're bold, too smart for their own good or too bad to be cared. Detachment is a chronicle of three weeks in the lives of several high school teachers, administrators and students through the eyes of a substitute teacher named Henry Barthes (Adrien Brody). Barthes' method of imparting vital knowledge to his temporary students is interrupted by the arrival of three women in his life. His life gets more complicated when he takes in a teenage prostitute called Erica (Sami Gayle). I loved everything about Detachment, from script, to writing, direction, performances and most importantly the whole presentation. It's more like a documentary than a movie, which favored the movie considering its genre. Adrian Brody does a fantastic job as an actor and it won't be wrong to say that since the Pianist, that's her best performance till date. The performances by the supporting cast Sami Gayle, Aaron Sauter, James Caan, Christina Hendricks, Lucy Liu, Marcia Gay Harden, Bryan Cranston, William Petersen, Blythe Danner, Tim Blake Nelson and Betty Kaye is realistic and simply superb.

450,Death of a Salesman,"We are still no nearer the meaning of ""Tragedy""","The most discussed question in ""Death of a Salesman"" for many, many years has been the one of whether or not the life and decay of Willy Loman is a tragedy. It can't be a tragedy since the only tragedy lies within the self-destroying character of Willy Loman who fails to value himself, and in the end, his life. Willy Loman (Dustin Hoffmann) has been a Salesman for many years. As he gets older he looks back at his life and how everything used to be, and discovers that he failed in life. He is an underachiever who feels a terrible conscience for his sins. These sins are more sins of failure because the nature of Willy's sins (or mistakes) were of human nature. He, for example, failed to be a good role model for his children and blames himself that despite their age of over thirty, they still haven't found their destiny. Biff (John Malkovich) is a daydreamer and former kleptomaniac who does not have a stable job, nor a stable income to marry and start a family. Biff is Willy's favorite, although he's also an underachiever, and at the age of 34 still unsuccessful. Then there's Happy (Stephan Lang) who has been seeking his father's attention since he was a child. Happy has a job, but is a devious person and a womanizer. Both children don't seem to have much respect for their father. The only person who shows respect more than anyone else, and despite Willy's affair with an ominious blonde woman, is Willy's wife Linda (Kate Reid). She doesn't want to see the bad and sticks to her husband until his suicidal death. Playwright Arthur Miller has written many plays, none of which had ever had as many versions as ""Death of a Salesman."" There are versions of `Death of a Salesman' from a Jewish, African-American, and a British perspective.

They have you put on a blindfold so you dont know which restaurant you are going to.... and then when you take off the blindfold it is Wendy's burger joint.

Chris Nolan made a film which make's even science freaks also don't know some of 'em which he implied in the film. It is evidently clear that he doesn't like this 3-D world which instead he created 5-D world and made 'Time' as a physical quantity in his world. Literally there is no words to explain the ingenuity of Chris. The way he crafted the characters and effectively using technical expertise and screen writing definitely make us to taste 'Transcendence'. once again he proved that he is not a contemporary director but a director who evolved from unrealistic future. Matt did a splendid job by portraying 'cooper' and express his emotions as a destitute and grief-stricken father was incomparable. Hans zimmer, he is at his best. Anne and Jess made justice to their roles. Matt Damon and Michael Caine played a pivotal role as well. Chris also made 'India' as part of his film because of 'M.O.M' i think, even though it is little about India i think. overall film is astoundingly superb with intense screenplay unless you detest physics or you lack keenness but its better to study a Lil'bit before 'bon appetite'.

455,October Sky,Coming-of-Age Classic,"Those who describe this movie as trite or filled with emotional cliches, in my opinion, don't have a clue as to what this movie's about. This is a film about emotions and how to guide one's passions with conscious, responsible decisions. Following one's dream and, in the process, becoming a man. Leaving what's old and heartless behind. With a title like ""October Sky,"" should that come as a surprise? Thomas Wolfe would be proud. The feelings Joe Johnston elicits aren't artificially affected and that's what those nay-sayers have a problem with - they actually do feel a sense of humanity while watching this. Even for me (a film fanatic), it came as a surprise what this film contained: good script, great acting, beautiful cinematography (from the Charles Sheeler opening montage to the Conrad Hall inspired scene with the rain-on-the-windowpane-symbolizing-pain from In Cold Blood). It's intentionally and successfully moving. So for those who grew up in dying rural America or for those who ever had a dream that others scorned or for those who ever had a beating heart, I recommend this movie highly. Much like The Last Picture Show, it deals with coming-of-age in a dying setting, but unlike Bogdanovich's film, it doesn't leave you cold in the end - it makes you feel ALIVE.",,Shicks-2,2004/05/05,1,1
456,The Green Mile,Analysts...,"""We think of this place like an intensive care ward of a hospital."" So says Paul Edgecomb, who is in charge of Death Row in a Louisiana penitentiary during the Depression. Paul (Tom Hanks) is a nice man, probably nicer than your average Louisiana Death Row guard, and his staff is competent and humane--all except for the loathsome Percy, whose aunt is married to the governor, and who could have any state job he wants, but likes it here because ""he wants to see one cook up close."" One day a new prisoner arrives. He is a gigantic black man, framed by the low-angle camera to loom over the guards and duck under doorways. This is John Coffey (""like the drink, only not spelled the same""), and he has been convicted of molesting and killing two little white girls. From the start it is clear he is not what he seems. He is afraid of the dark, for one thing. He is straightforward in shaking Paul's hand--not like a man with anything to be ashamed of. This is not a good summer for Paul. He is suffering from a painful infection and suffering, too, because Percy (Doug Hutchison) is like an infection in the ward: ""The man is mean, careless and stupid--that's a bad combination in a place like this."" Paul sees his duty as regulating a calm and decent atmosphere in which men prepare to die. ""The Green Mile"" (so-called because this Death Row has a green floor) is based on a novel by Stephen King, and has been written and directed by Frank Darabont. It is Darabont's first film since the great ""The Shawshank Redemption"" in 1994. That, too, was based on a King prison story, but this one is very different. It involves the supernatural, for one thing--in a spiritual, not creepy, way. Both movies center on relationships between a white man and a black man. In ""Shawshank"" the black man was the witness to a white man's dogged determination, and here the black man's function is to absorb the pain of whites--to redeem and forgive them. By the end, when he is asked to forgive them for sending him to the electric chair, the story has so well prepared us that the key scenes play like drama, not metaphor, and that is not an easy thing to achieve. The movie is told in flashback as the memories of Paul as an old man, now in a retirement home. ""The math doesn't quite work out,"" he admits at one point, and we find out why. The story is in no haste to get to the sensational and supernatural; it takes at least an hour simply to create the relationships in the prison, where Paul's lieutenant (David Morse) is rock-solid and dependable, where the warden (James Cromwell) is good and fair, and where the prisoners include a balmy coot named Delacroix (Michael Jeter) and a taunting monster named Wharton (Sam Rockwell). Looming over all is the presence of John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), a man whose own lawyer says he seems to have ""dropped out of the sky."" Coffey cannot read or write, seems simpleminded, causes no trouble and exudes goodness. The reason Paul consults the lawyer is because he comes to doubt this prisoner could have killed the little girls. Yet Coffey was found with their broken bodies in his huge arms. And in Louisiana in the 1930s, a black man with such evidence against him is not likely to be acquitted by a jury. (We might indeed question whether a Louisiana Death Row in the 1930s would be so fair and hospitable to a convicted child molester, but the story carries its own conviction, and we go along with it.) There are several sequences of powerful emotion in the film. Some of them involve the grisly details of the death chamber, and the process by which the state makes sure that a condemned man will actually die (Harry Dean Stanton has an amusing cameo as a stand-in at a dress rehearsal with the electric chair). One execution is particularly gruesome and seen in some detail; the R rating is earned here, despite the film's generally benevolent tone. Other moments of great impact involve a tame mouse which Delacroix adopts, a violent struggle with Wharton (and his obscene attempts at rabble-rousing), and subplots involving the wives of Paul (Bonnie Hunt) and the warden (Patricia Clarkson). But the center of the movie is the relationship between Paul and his huge prisoner Coffey. Without describing the supernatural mechanism that is involved, I can explain in Coffey's own words what he does with the suffering he encounters: ""I just took it back, is all."" How he does that and what the results are, all set up the film's ending--in which we are reminded of another execution some 2,000 years ago. I have started to suspect that when we talk about ""good acting"" in the movies, we are really discussing two other things: good casting and the creation of characters we react to strongly. Much of a performance is created in the filmmaking itself, in photography and editing and the emotional cues of music. But an actor must have the technical and emotional mastery to embody a character and evoke him persuasively, and the film must give him a character worth portraying. Tom Hanks is our movie Everyman, and his Paul is able to win our sympathy with his level eyes and calm, decent voice. We get a real sense of his efficient staff, of the vile natures of Percy and Wharton, and of the goodness of Coffey--who is embodied by Duncan in a performance that is both acting and being. The movie is a shade over three hours long. I appreciated the extra time, which allows us to feel the passage of prison months and years. Stephen King, sometimes dismissed as merely a best-seller, has in his best novels some of the power of Dickens, who created worlds that enveloped us and populated them with colorful, peculiar, sharply seen characters. King in his strongest work is a storyteller likely to survive as Dickens has, despite the sniffs of the litcrit establishment. By taking the extra time, Darabont has made King's ""The Green Mile"" into a story which develops and unfolds, which has detail and space. The movie would have been much diminished at two hours--it would have been a series of episodes without context. As Darabont directs it, it tells a story with beginning, middle, end, vivid characters, humor, outrage and emotional release. Dickensian.",10.0,stefannemanja7,2020/07/30,3,2
457,Blackfish,Man is the Beast,"Greetings again from the darkness. Dogs, cats, fish, birds, hamsters, ferrets, snakes, and even pigs. We love our pets. We also love our zoos, city aquariums and SeaWorld parks. For many years, we have chosen to believe that the research and educational advances that come from these outlets outweigh any of the negatives involved with keeping wild animals in captivity. Filmmaker Gabriela Cowperthwaite shows us (by focusing on SeaWorld) that it's way past time for us to open our eyes to the cruelty involved with the capture and training of wild animals for entertainment purpose. The points made here are not speculation. We witness numerous interviews with ""former"" SeaWorld trainers. It's clear these people thought they had a bond with their co-performers. Most never even mention the term ""killer whale"" ... the common moniker for the majestic creatures better known as Orcas. The interviews have great impact, and when combined with startling TV news clips and footage from audience members, it becomes obvious that the huge profits and entertainment offered to families, are quite frankly generated by an immoral and inexcusable business model. Most of the story is tied together by the 2010 death of super-trainer Dawn Brancheau by Tilikum, the largest Orca in the SeaWorld group. What we soon learn is that Tilikum was captured in Iceland waters at the age of three, and has since had many incidents resulting in injuries and even three deaths. It's also stated that Tilikum is the head of the family tree for the majority of SeaWorld's performing Orcas. Of course, no one can or should blame these incredibly intelligent and emotional and family-oriented creatures. Everything about their existence goes against their natural habitat and way of life. The real issue is ... just because we CAN capture and train these animals, does that mean we SHOULD? If the focus is profits, then the answer is apparently yes. If instead, the focus is respecting nature and valuing other species, then the answer is much different. The Cove and Project Nim are two other documentaries that come to mind when thinking about filmmakers attempting to expose the danger in training wild animals. Watching this story had me hanging my head like the fisherman from the 1970's as he helped capture a young whale, as the family members swam nearby crying and screeching. Let's hope director Cowperthwaite's screams are heard. See this movie before deciding to visit another SeaWorld (who couldn't be bothered to comment on camera). There are better ways to teach your kids about nature and there are certainly less cruel forms of entertainment.",7.0,ferguson-6,2013/08/06,90,78
458,Horrible Bosses 2,I laughed so hard,"I honestly thought it was way better than the first. This movie is ridiculous, the whole scenario is ridiculous which is what makes it funny. The three main actors have the best synergy. Three morons who try to kidnap a millionaire's son for ransom, you can only imagine the chaos that ensues. I really enjoyed it, but the humour is a little silly so it's not for all. You either going to like it or hate it, more specifically Charlie Day. A lot of people complain about his voice, but personally I thought he was one of the funniest. One thing is for sure, this movie does not deserve a 6.

460,Crash,Nearly complete failure,"I just watched Crash. This movie was way over the top and let me know almost right away it was not deserving of best picture. I was engladdened at first because it seemed like it might be another Magnolia type movie, but in the end the only comparison to Magnolia was the neat hippie music and the lack of resolution in many (try every one) of the story lines. Racism was a central theme, but as it pertained to this story it was a seemingly desultory, random element that was artificially injected at random points. The racism was extremely unnatural and forced and out of place in many instances. The result was that the movie came across not as being edgy and truthful like people are pretending this movie is, but rather ignorant and contrived at best. For example, the crack by Cheadle about ""all those cultures getting together and deciding to park their cars on their lawns"" was from left field and artificially inflammatory coming from a character who previously and thereafter gave us no racist indicators at all. There were no clues up to that point or after that he was racist or capable of such a statement (it was out of place in the conversation too), and the line had no place in his character or in the movie. And no, saying ""everyone is racist and that's why he said it"" is not true and not acceptable. The line was out of character, out of place, and therefore without taste. Some of the stories were good, but only up until race was artificially inseminated all over the screen. Additionally the whole movie was highly predictable. The scenes with the shopkeeper, the gun, the dead kid at the beginning of the movie, etc. - all predicted easily by me (and if I can predict events in a movie that is not a good thing at all). The clincher though that was the bizarre late night country music ""I feel like picking up a random black youth in an apparent act of kindness and then ignorantly and confrontationally stereotyping him to his face even though it is out of my character and it was in fact my partner who was the racist one, not me"" scene with Ryan Pillippie's character (who also presented no pre or post incident racist tendencies). What the heck was that? That should have been a deleted scene. On top of all this, the movie needed another 30 minutes at least to at least bring one or two more stories to conclusion. The Phillippe thing and the Cheadle Latino crack really bothered me the most though. I mean, I could buy the Sandra Bullock snooty rich white lady thing, but the rest was way too much. I think the fact that someone wrote a movie that says all people are racist says quite a lot about the writers and all the people involved, but says nothing about society as the movie had no realism whatsoever. The movie was almost complete in it's failure, but for Hollywood to admit that would mean so much more than just pretending it makes some kind of awe-inspiring statement about race. I hate to tell them and all of Hollywood that hailed this movie, but this has already been done and with more success (although still flawed) in the movie Grand Canyon. It is a far superior movie with race as the central theme. It was challenging and in your face and honest in the way Crash wishes it was, but with an inferior cast and far far less hype. If Hollywood really wanted to embrace racism being pushed to the forefront and being examined, then Bamboozled would have won best picture the year it came out (or at least been nominated).",1.0,leeloo67,2006/09/25,131,75

I always thought about animals in captivity and how it was bad for them but after I watched Blackfish it really opened my eye to a whole new level of cruelty that all animals in captivity suffer. It is a shame that the trainers had to learn the hard way the meaning behind the Killer Whales name. I was really surprised how even the trainers were kept in the dark for so long about Tilliky.

462,Primal Fear,Much better than the Grisham film adaptions,"Courtroom thrillers are about a dime a dozen. If you've seen one, you've them all, right? Not quite. This little gem may appear to just be another run-of-the-mill Grisham knock-offs, but many may be surprised to find that the film is actually very good. Richard Gere delivers one of his finest performances as arrogant lawyer Martain Vail, who ends up defending an innocent-looking alter boy (Edward Norton, very impressive debut) for the murder of the Arch Bishop. Laura Linney pulls off a smashing, and overlooked, turn as Vail's ex. flame, who ends up being (where else?) on the prosecution side.

463,The Green Mile,I cannot believe people liked this so much!,"This has got to be one of the most overrated movies of all time. It didn't suck really bad, IMO, but was just plain average - and on the boring side of that. I didn't find it very emotionally moving, and I thought it was quite ""cheesy"". I didn't get really involved and enveloped into the movie as one would when watching a truly great film, and I even say this in a nice big theatre too. This movie just didn't turn my crank, it was very predictable, was not very thought provoking, and I'm very surprised there aren't more mixed reviews at least from the users of this site... The Green Mile is NOWHERE CLOSE to The Shawshank Redemption, and shouldn't even be mentioned in the same sentence as an emotionally powerful masterpiece such as that. Granted that neither film is meant to appeal to your intellectual side, but more to your emotions - this film even fails at that, in my opinion. Perhaps I just couldn't get into it because it was too cheesy... Overall, this was a disappointing film, and I know I'm not the only one who thinks that as well. Based on people I've spoken with, this film should have more mixed reviews rather than the overwhelming praise it seems to have got.",5.0,Guile`,2001/02/08,13,6
464,The Chorus,La Petite Bon-Bon,"This award winning French film is a frothy little confection. Short on plot (what plot?)or indeed on just about everything else too, it nevertheless took me on a wonderful trip with its music. Gerard Jugnot(and does anybody else out there think he's a dead ringer for Bob Hoskins?)shines as the inspired music teacher, a beautiful performance. There's little to the script or the other characters who are all drawn in the black and white mode so beloved of Hollywood,i.e. the headmaster: bad, the injured old caretaker: a saint. A few throwaway lines about the headmaster's daughters goes nowhere, ***minor spoiler***as does the taking of Papinot (aren't there, like, laws about such things?)from the school.***end of spoiler***. We have seen all of this in other movies, often done better but the music transports as does the cinematography which is highly evocative of the era.

465,Blackfish,Black Waters,"(Recommended) This documentary by Gabriela Cowperthwaite has a specific point of view in dealing with the mistreatment of whales in captivity, specifically at SeaWorld Amusement Park. Using archival footage and interviews with former SeaWorld trainers and animal rights activists, Blackfish effectively explores this controversial issue. (SeaWorld refused to participate in any interviews for the film, but has since taken out many full page ads to combat any negative publicity.) That said, the film is a well-made and powerful indictment against their policy. The film's strongest impact is in its actual news footage of documented attacks by these captive mammals to SeaWorld trainers, resulting in three deaths, and the eloquent words of the interviewees about the human loss and inhumane conditions for the killer whales. Director Cowperthwaite has created a compelling film that not only shows the lack of compassion to these animals, but questions their unethical treatment at the sea park. Also coming into question is the media spin of the SeaWorld organization and its corporate policies. Blackfish appeals to any moviegoers' emotions and the filmmakers could have used some distance in presenting its case. Missing from the film are more interviews with family members and their legal battles with SeaWorld, an important aspect which is only glossed over. Granted, a more objective vision and SeaWorld's own participation would have made the film balanced and more effective. It is a story that needs to be told. Nevertheless, whether you are pro or con, this documentary is making waves as Blackfish presents its convincing, though biased, exposé on animal cruelty for all the world to see and personally judge for themselves.

469,Detachment,What's happening in our schools?,"Got a last second seat to see this at Tribeca and it was terrific. I wasn't prepared for such an intense roller coaster, but I was very moved. Adrien Brody gives his best performance since The Pianist and what a supporting cast James Caan is hilarious, Marcia Gay Harden is amazing, and Lucy Liu (of all people) is so vulnerable I didn't know she was capable of that. It seems like actors we have come to rely on for solid performances decided to experiment and step outside their comfort zone, under the direction of Tony Kaye (American History X). The film itself is a harsh look at the realities facing inner city schools. Brody plays a substitute journeyman teacher, Henry Barthes, who (a little too Dangerous Minds) connects with his misguided students but as opposed to trying to confront his students or make them read poetry (like 5 million other lame movies), he seems to share his own pain and anger with the world in order to connect..It really works. On them, and on us. I don't want to give anything away, but this is a film that confronts both psychological and physical tragedy, where every character seems to be up against their own feeling of helplessness students, teachers, administration, and a young prostitute who doesn't attend school that Henry decides to help. One especially powerful scene is Parent/Teacher night. Shocking, subtle, and effortless. That's how I would describe this whole movie. Ultimately, Detachment was very thorough at examining the ins and outs of the schools problems through individuals and as a collective. But it also feels like a character piece about this tormented substitute. The movie jumps a little too much (maybe), but I don't really care. Tony Kaye does what he does best here, delivers a gritty, edgy, shocking, and ultimately important film. This is a director that should be making more films. I hope to see Detachment in theaters soon and I hope some of these performers will be in the conversation come awards season they deserve it.",9.0,ritewater06,2011/06/16,26,23

471,Primal Fear,Immensely watchable,"Well whaddaya know!? Richard Gere must have a new agent. Finally he's appeared in a half decent film. Never mind that both his character and his performance are a non-plus, and never mind that it is only Ed Norton and the fabulous plot that carry the whole thing. At least Gere has stumbled into a watchable film at long last. From William Diehl's novel comes this immensely watchable tale (adapted by Steve Shagan and Ann Biderman) about a prominent Catholic priest who is brutally murdered in his luxury home. Caught red-handed at the scene is altar boy Aaron Stampler, a stuttering, shy southerner who appears to be the obvious culprit, until it is discovered the victim was involved in some very shaky property dealings. Edward Norton is outstanding as the accused assailant, a young lad who vehemently denies the allegations of murder, claiming he saw someone else in the room before he blacked out. His performance, along with the brilliant story, makes the entire show. Richard Gere, Laura Linney and the rest of the cast are barely background, and are unable to make anything of their cardboard characters. The possibility of depth to their respective personas is briefly touched on, but never fulfilled. Director Gregory Hoblit has made the transition from T.V. to film very well, concentrating as he has on the strengths of the script and Norton's strong turn. Backing him up is some sound cinematography from Michael Chapman and an effective score by James Newton Howard. Editing is also astute.

'Death of a Salesman' Synopsis: An aging traveling salesman recognizes the emptiness of his life and tries to fix it. Based on the 1949 play of the same name by Arthur Miller, 'Death of a Salesman' succeeds by becoming an absorbing cinematic tale as well. It efficiently structures the story of an aged man, who is on the verge of killing himself. The Writing Material is engaging & very human, if I may say so. Volker Schlöndorff Directs this story, with maturity. Hoffman & Malkovich, as mentioned before, stand out with their performances & shine the brightest, they overshadow the narrative, to a large extend. Hoffman is astonishing as an aging traveling salesman, while Malkovich is magnificent as his troubled son. They both deliver legendary, unforgettable performances, that deserve immense praise.

Blackfish shows the sometimes devastating consequences of keeping such intelligent and sentient creatures in captivity. As a horror fan, I have to say they showed a nice clip from ""Orca"". But beyond that, it is also an incredible documentary looking at the captivity of killer whales, and also the horrible things that are done to capture the animals. One an easily see why attacks occur. SeaWorld spoke out, saying, ""Blackfish is inaccurate and misleading and, regrettably, exploits a tragedy. The film paints a distorted picture that withholds key facts about SeaWorld —- among them that SeaWorld rescues, rehabilitates and returns to the wild hundreds of wild animals every year, and that SeaWorld commits millions of dollars annually to conservation and scientific research."" Now, I do not know enough to really respond, other than I doubt anything in the film was made up. Maybe one-sided, but still factually correct. How did this not get an Oscar nomination? It was easily better than ""Cutie and the Boxer"" and (in my opinion) the winning film, ""20 Feet From Stardom"". Did they think it was too similar to ""The Cove""?",8.0,gavin6942,2014/03/03,7,6

'Hotel Transylvania' starts with an interesting and promising storyline that make people hope these would be so fun and hilarious. The concept is quite attractive and make me curious what would happen next when they introduce hotel for monsters. Unfortunately, the movie left with a disappointment. The storyline is not focus, sometimes really annoying and the plot is flat from start through the end. They tried to make people laugh with it's joke which is not funny at all. Also Jonathan's character is too annoying, they should put him in right role. Overall, 'Hotel Transylvania' is mostly just a joke.

477,The Wailing,A father's struggle to see his daughter to get well.,"A new film from the writer, director of 'The Chaser' and 'The Yellow Sea'. This time its a horror-thriller that focused on a rural police officer who witnesses a series of strange events escalating fears among its people. The original title was 'Goksung', which means the name of the village where this story takes place. This film is specially for those who like Korean films. But I'm sure that everyone would enjoy it equally. Very typical Korean film yet an engaging theme and thrilling, particularly towards the final quarter. The opening, and almost the first act were like a black comedy. That does remain same after sometime. Because they wanted to give an impression what kind of person is this story's lead man. He's a cop, but feared of supernatural stuffs. So one day, he gets an early morning call to head where a family was slaughtered by one of its members. In his small village, with a small population, events like this are very rare, but when another similar incident was reported, ruled out what it was considered, but something else beyond humans. After the strange dreams, he comes to know his family too got affected by it, particularly his young daughter. Followed by when it gets serious issue, the family decides to bring in a shaman and so the ceremony begins to free her from whatever possessed. This is where the film turns more aggressive in revealing following event with twists and turns. The rest of the film should be watched to know how it all ends. The first thing was the film length. It was too long, nearly 150 minutes, but the screenplay filled with many enthralling scenes and dialogues. So I don't think sitting for that long would be an issue for most of the people. Surely you will be on your seat edge most of the time on your watch. Good story, but very confusing. I mean not puzzling way, but the events and its characters, especially the conclusion which is not exactly a perfect one with proper detail. So you might look for some clarifications after watching the film. ""If you go fishing, do you know what you'll catch? He's just fishing. Not even he knows what he'll catch."" The concept was a little confusing like what kind of horror is this. At one stage there comes a zombie, but it follows right after an exorcism on a girl possessed by a ghost. The writer used the time as long as he wants to develop them. So the narration was slow, but very steady on its direction going deep. If you are good at Korean films, the style they make, you might predict some of the scenes correctly. Like I said the final few minutes might confuse you, but really well done part if you understand that clearly. The film characters wise, I liked how it all connected at the end. But as a story, the solution did not seem right. I think not the fitting one or more convincing. I know who would you root, I mean most of you back what character, so from that perspective, feels it compromised a bit after put up a stern fight with what they had believed. I liked how culturally this story was narrated. I mean as its set in a small village, the ceremonies to fight the evil spirit was conducted traditional way, not the western style, except it opened with a quote from the bible. The actors were perfect, particularly I liked where it was shot. A fine location to mix horror and cop themes. The suspense keeps the film alive, but you won't always looking at that, because the theme expands quite bigger than you expect. There are some unexpected turns, you might find yourself scratching your head for how deep it could go. Don't worry, in the end, it all comes together, or maybe watching it twice could help you with that. As I said the runtime might not favour you for the second viewing. Besides, pay a good attention while watching it for the first time, then you will get everything. Particularly if you are an animal lover, that's a biggest clue you could get in this film. I think it will be one of the best horror you would find around the world this year. It might get remade elsewhere, but the chances are less and it could remain as one of the Korean classics in the line of many others like 'Memories of Murder'. You don't have to be a Korean film fan or this director's, but if you do, surely you will have an advantage in understanding it clearly and like it more than the others. Definitely it is one of the best Korean films, but I don't think so a must see, not according to me. Though I won't conclude my review without recommending it to you. So I say watch it. 7.5/10",8.0,Reno-Rangan,2016/12/04,9,3

He fills the day with events, convincing a friend to steal his father's prized Porsch and another to say her grandmother is dead. He bulldozes his sister, his parents, school staff and his friends. I found him obnoxious and dishonest to the extreme of not liking the main character at all - thus I was in trouble in the first ten minutes of the film. To add to this turmoil, there is a caricature of a principal, Mr. Rooney, who endeavours to track down Ferris. Mr. Rooney winds up in extreme slapstick situations, quite unfunny to this viewer and far too frequently I was reminded of that awfulness ""Home Alone"", in fact a lot of the scenes are similar, complicated gadgets rigged up at the last minute to foil the ""bad guy"", in this case the school principal doing an extreme form of his job. Nothing really makes sense. Jennifer Grey does a lot with her role as Ferris' sister as does Ferris' best friend. I guess confronting and beating authority is funny when you're say, twelve, but there's not much of a story for anyone in the other demographics of the movie watching public. 3 out of 10, some of the music was really good, some scenes are quite striking, but not enough to carry the whole mess.",3.0,wisewebwoman,2008/01/12,38,15
481,The Chorus,Music is the answer,"One of the most touching movies ever made. It shows the importance of music in children's education, and in life as well.

482,The Fault in Our Stars,Pain demands to be felt,"This film was popular with young adults. My daughter when to an advance preview, the kind where you have a live by satellite Q&A session with the stars. As a parent you do end up questioning why would you want to see a romance movie about young people with cancer? In this case beautiful young people in a Hollywood movie. I had a sibling who had cancer at a young age, it was horrible, a nightmare and nothing like this movie. Hazel (Shailene Woodley) has cancer. She goes to a cancer support group where she meets Augustus (Ansel Elgort) a one legged cancer survivor. Both share an acerbic wit and an unconventional view of life. On a visit to Amsterdam to see a reclusive and alcoholic writer they fall in love. The fact that they have a kiss in Anne Frank's attic where a crowd applauds tells you all you need to know that this film has no taste. It starts off engagingly, like a stoic fight against the odds kind of movie with some black humour. It then becomes inert, really going nowhere, the narration becomes a nuisance and then the saccharine kicks in.",4.0,Prismark10,2018/10/15,7,4
483,Primal Fear,Full of holes but still enjoyable and inventive,"When an altar boy, Aaron Stampler, is accused of murdering a priest, the media-friendly, arrogant lawyer Martin Vail takes the case (and the headlines). However he discovers that the boy is not all he seems and that there may have been a third person in the room when the priest was murdered. However his plea is fixed and he must work the case to turn things back to his advantage. Years ago, the UK did a day where the Government subsidised cinemas to offer all tickets for £1. On that day I had nothing I wanted to see but I thought (like thousands other) that a saving of £3 (at the time) was too good to miss, so I went to see this film despite my caution when it comes to courtroom thrillers. The plot here is so very full of holes that it is a wonder that the whole film doesn't fall into itself, however it just about manages to succeed by being quite clever and significantly different from the usual courtroom stuff (although it does still have the same faults as the rest of the genre). The film is a lot darker than many courtroom thrillers; first of all, Vail is not a sympathetic character - he is arrogant and conceited, and the film never really offers him redemption at any point. Likewise the climax of the film is not the usual genre twist - or rather, it is, but not in the usual way. The film's main weakness however is that it is at least 20 minutes too long. The revelations about Roy happen but then are forgotten for about 10 minutes and then raised again before being put aside again. I really can't even understand why the film feels so padded at points in the middle when really that was when the Roy thing kicks in and the film should have stepped up a gear in a flash. That it doesn't is a problem, but not an insurmountable one, as it does slowly get faster towards a downbeat conclusion that is enjoyably different from the usual Perry Mason style twist (although it is a twist). I'm by no means a Richard Gere fan, but he does a very good job here. He never wants to be a good guy here and he plays it well. However the film is driven by a great performance from Norton, marking himself out as one to watch in coming years. His dual roles are great and the film would have failed if he hadn't been able to carry it off. The support cast is surprisingly deep with people who were either well-known at the time or became famous later. When a cast includes Mahoney, McDormand, Woodard, Linney, Seda, and Braugher then it is worth a look - although some of them have very small roles there are no weak links. However it is a credit to Norton that he stands shoulder to shoulder with all of them and is the one that sticks in the mind long after it finishes. Overall this is an enjoyable courtroom thriller that only struggles in the middle with an inability to really just let rip. It's ironic, but I enjoyed it because it was less showy and so on when compared to others of the genre, but it could have benefited from knowing when to let go sooner. However the cast is top notch and the unlikely plot is held together by a low key Gere and a fantastic central performance(s) from Norton.",,bob the moo,2004/02/01,82,52
484,Taxi Driver,"""characterized by an almost crushing boredom and emptiness""","According to another reviewer on this site, JosefSerf: '""Taxi Driver"" is about loneliness and loneliness is characterized by an almost crushing boredom and emptiness and Travis Bickle's character reflects that. His life is dull and boring, hardly anything happens to him and that is what ""Taxi Driver"" shows - Bickle's pathetic life.' And that's what you get, a crushingly boring movie about a deranged man. If that's how you want to spend a couple of hours of your life there's probably something wrong with you. The ending, while not as dull as the rest of the film, is equally stupid. I watched it because it's supposed to be one of the great cinema 'masterpieces'. I've come to the conclusion that 'masterpieces' should have some sort of government warning attached along the lines of ""WARNING: MASTERPIECE - ONLY VIEW IF YOU'RE A TERRIBLE BORE WHO LIKES THESE SORTS OF THINGS - YOU CANNOT GET THOSE TWO HOURS OF YOUR LIFE BACK.

487,Pulp Fiction,Lightning in a Bottle,"So original, it comes off like an experimentational movie, but one that catches fire with absolutely brilliant writing, dialogue, and character creation, in addition to all-time standout performances by every single actor, which means the directing was also superb. Some people may still question what it's about because for the most part we have four different stories converging at various coordinates in a timeline loop that do not clearly have a meaning as to why other than to just have creative fun with the way it's told. You have a philosophizing, bible thumping hitman (Samuel L Jackson) finding his path to salvation and restored faith and theism while participating in the events that comprise the movie. This movie is perfect in so many scenes with only a few weak parts. It's loaded with memorable lines, and it was meticulously cared for into every last detail including the music and what dance moves characters should have in addition to the outrageously brilliant screenplay that somehow never slips over the top.

491,Taxi Driver,Traffic,"Spoilers herein. Readers of my other comments know that I believe that there are different types of films, depending on whether the skeleton is the writer's, the actor's, or the camera's. The more I use it, the more confidence I have that in general, one drives out the other. Just before reseeing this, I worked on `One-Eyed Jacks,' which is probably the touchstone of the actor driving out the eye. But here, we have a happy accident of three talents that don't step on each other: DeNiro, Schrader and Scorsese. Of these, Schrader is the strongest and every deviation from his vision weakens the fabric. The one main example is Keitel's dance with Jodie. The key device here is that the narrator is Bickle. Everything is/must be something he personally witnesses (until his death) and reports to us. The idea is far from novel. Why it works here is Scorsese's intuition to play the camera OFF of Bickle, while De Niro works to keep the attention on him. That tension (which Schrader intended) is what makes this work. But this is not perfect. Keitel, like De Niro doesn't get this dynamic; we don't want De Niro to, that would ruin the main device because we want him to pull to himself against the camera. But when Keitel does his stuff, it has a negative effect because there is no narrative countermeasure.. Foster's presence was good enough when this film was new because the very idea of a 12 year old whore was enough. But seeing it a quarter century later, you can see her thinness compared to the rest of the cast. They really understand their characters and crawl into them. She has no idea, none at all. Another problem is the cab metaphor. Paul didn't quite center that one. He did get it right later with the ambulance in `Bringing Out the Dead,' which used the same energy of selfish actor pulling one way and camera pulling another way. But that time, they fought over the vehicle at the same time they fought in your mind. And of course that had De Palma's eye. Finally, the camera we see here has energy, but far less than what Scorsese's buddy De Palma was doing at this time. Imagine what De Palma (or Hitchcock) would have done with that angel shot after the massacre.",,tedg,2001/12/22,27,14

A very pleasant, well crafted, and even-tempered film with some lovely choir music, ""The Chorus"" is a bit corny but should be a pleasing watch for sentimentalists and others interested in simple and heart warming film fare.

493,Taxi Driver,"Best movie of the Seventies, and one of the greatest of all time.","So much has been written and talked about 'Taxi Driver' that it seems almost redundant to add anything more. But watching it again the other night for the nth time I was, as I have been every single time I've seen it, struck by just how perfect this movie is. It is as powerful and disturbing now as it was twenty-five years ago. It has not only NOT aged, it gets better and more relevant every year. This is without doubt a modern classic, and one of the handful of truly great, timeless movies. Scorsese and Schrader went on to make other great movies after this, both separately ('The King Of Comedy', 'Light Sleeper') and together ('Raging Bull', 'The Last Temptation Of Christ'), but this is easily the best movie of their careers. And Robert De Niro's too. He has yet to top his stunning performance here as the deeply disturbed and alienated Vietnam veteran Travis Bickle, cabbie and would be assassin. This character has not surprisingly entered movie legend. Scorsese surrounds De Niro with a first rate supporting cast, including small but effective roles from Harvey Keitel ('Reservoir Dogs'), Peter Boyle ('Hardcore'), the underrated Victor Argo ('The King Of New York') and Joe Spinell ('Maniac'). Albert Brooks and Jodie Foster are also very good, and even Cybil Shepherd, the butt of many jokes, is fine as Bickle's obsession. When you combine these actors, Schrader's outstanding script, and Scorsese's brilliant direction, with the stunning cinematography (Michael Chapman) and haunting score (Hitchcock fave Bernard Herrmann's final effort), you have yourself a truly unforgettable cinematic experience. If you haven't seen 'Taxi Driver' I urge you to do so immediately. It is a masterpiece, pure and simple.",,Infofreak,2002/06/04,218,148
494,Ferris Bueller's Day Off,Want a Day Off --- Ferris Bueller will show you how to do it!!!!,"Ferris Bueller's Day off is practically a step by step guide to taking a day off from school, although it requires some elaborate equipment and schemes, both of which Ferris has in abundance, to much chagrin from his sister and the school principal whom are not fooled by his schemes. Ferris has decided to take his ninth day off with his best friend Cameron and his girlfriend Sloane. With the principal hot on their tails Ferris and Co. drive around town in Cameron's father's Ferrari, go see a baseball match, eat at a fancy restaurant and watches a parade (well Ferris participate in it to some extent). This movie is fun to watch mostly due to the principal and Cameron but also due to the elaborate schemes of Ferris and the way he tricks his parents into believing that he's really sick (the father even 'sees' his son a couple of times but for some reason dosn't recognize him?????) It has some pretty stupid moments (like the above mentioned scenes with the father). But these dos not ruin the movie in any way. The acting is okay, not award winning but satisfactory enough: Matthew Broderick does a okay job at portraying Ferris Bueller; the scheming kid. Alan Ruck as Cameron Frye; the somewhat insecure kid; is probable the actor that does the best work here, especially considering that he at the time was near 30 years (well above the normal age of a high school kid). Mia Sara as Sloane Peterson does an fairly anonymous performance, this can be due to the fact that the character doesn't do that much in the first place. Jeffrey Jones does a splendid job as Edward R. Rooney; the school principal; in fact his performance also candidates to the best alongside Ruck's. Jennifer Grey plays Jeanie Bueller; Ferris's sister; with a pretty stuck up trait, this is probably how she's supposed to play it but in comes out somewhat single minded. In smaller roles we have Ben Stein as Economics Teacher and Del Close as English Teacher, both does a fairly boring impression, but this is in most cases how teachers seem; boring and dry (actually this is how Ben Stein plays most of the roles I have seen him in). In cameo roles we have Kristy Swanson as Simone Adamley, Charlie Sheen as Boy in Police Station, both does okay especially Sheen. All in all I give this 6 out of 10. If you like either Broderick, Ruck or Jones then see this you won't regret it. If your not that big a Broderick fan then it depends on how small a fan of him you are whether or not you'll like this.",6.0,saxon-7,2006/03/11,6,4
495,The Fault in Our Stars,Hurting So Good (Raging FIlm Reviews),"I was nervous going into The Fault in Our Stars. I really liked the book, although it had been hyped up quite a bit, and I knew that the trailers made the movie look like a cheesy and somewhat ""hip"" adaptation. The movie, however, blew away my doubts and resulted in probably the saddest movie you'll see all year or for quite some time. For all of you who haven't read the bestseller, The Fault in Our Stars follows Hazel (Shailene Woodley), a young girl suffering from cancer. She is bitter and snarky about her condition. She does not have any apparent friends (her one friend in the novel was cut from the film), and she feels like she is just a ""grenade"" waiting to go off. Her mom (Laura Dern) urges her to go to the group counseling at the local church. This is where she meets Augustus Waters (Ansel Elgort), the boy who will eventually sweep her off her feet. From the get-go, it is clear that Woodley shines in her performance. We grow so attached to her by the end of the film. Her performance brings the character from the pages of the book to life. The cancer has made her flawed. Not in the physical sense, but in the fact that she tries to build a shell around her life and is fearful of anybody getting close since she thinks she could die at any time. Her relationship with Augustus is fueled with such great chemistry that you would assume that they were actually a couple. Elgort, who starred with Woodley previously in Divergent is excellent in this as well. He will certainly be making more of a name for himself after this film. Their chemistry helps make the movie—which could come off as just a sucker-punching tear fest—into something where everything happens naturally without making it feel too forced or contrived. But sadly, not in a disappointing way, the film is still a tear fest. We know we are being set up for a huge emotional climax. We know that the cancer is forever present. We know we are going to cry; yet we go along for the journey because it feels true. With the movie clocking in at slightly over two hours, I did feel that it was long, but never did I not enjoy the ride. Even having read the book, the events of the movie still hit harder than I expected, resulting in multiple occasions of tear-filled eyes. I cannot say the same for the other people in attendance, though, because I heard several sobs from people behind me, and even some lingered into the credits. The movie is an emotional roller coaster right until the very end, so be prepared. The supporting cast supports the main cast admirably. Dern as Hazel's mother is a heartbreaking and real performance. Her character explains that even if Hazel were to die, she would still be a mother, and man do we lose it. Also supporting is Willem Dafoe, in yet another rough and unpleasant character, as well as Nat Wolff from the Naked Brothers Band who plays the star-crossed lovers' friend. Word has already been spread that he will be starring in another John Green adaptation, Paper Towns, so be on the lookout for that. In terms of actual filmmaking, there are a couple qualms that need addressing. Near the beginning of the film, the movie appears to be cut together by an editor who lacks any experience at all. I never really address editing in my reviews but there are some exceptionally bad moments in editing and sound editing. Sometimes it feels like the film is turning into an action film with some rather quick cuts that are done just for the sake of getting a different angle. In the end, The Fault in Our Stars will leave you in tears. It is an emotional journey along with two kids who have cancer and it reminds us to live life to the fullest and to never let the adverse elements in our lives keep us from living the life we want. We, like the characters, get to choose who or what hurts us. So, if you want to let some emotions out, go let this movie hurt you because it hurts so good. for more reviews, check out ragingfilm.com",8.0,scottjohnson7896,2014/07/02,19,10

What would our world of theatre be like if all productions of a play were done the exactly the same? I too was surprised at the way the character's in this movie were portrayed, but I was pleased that all of these brilliant actors created something new and powerful. People need to stop being so close-minded about their visions and expectations and realize that these actors have thought a lot more about their characters than any audience, and it shows through in their vibrant characters. Alex North does a great job at creating the mood with a passionate score that accents the utterly amazing script by, in my opinion, one of the greatest playwrights of all time. This is a must see drama which makes the audience think about the false ""American Dream"" we hold so dear.

498,Crash,An Unrelenting Parade of Ironies,"CRASH (2 outta 5 stars) I was really expecting to like this movie... there is a lot of great acting in it and some provocative dialogue and I generally love ensemble-type movies like this. So why did this movie irk me so much by the time it was all over? Maybe it was the piling on of one contrived coincidence after another. After a while I was not having the ""oh-wow"" reaction that was surely intended... but more like ""oh-good-grief"". Plus the unrelenting parade of ironies wore out its welcome after the first thirty minutes. Okay, fine, we get it... people are not ""good"" or ""bad"" but they all have *both* goodness and badness in them... you can stop hammering that point home now! After awhile it just started to ring false... like we were no longer eavesdropping on real-life situations but viewing the work of a biased sociologist who is manipulating the facts to support his thesis. So many scenes just didn't seem very realistic: the Persian man grabbing the gun and going after the locksmith, Ryan Philippe's overwrought reaction to a hitchhiker, even Sandra Bullock's sudden realization of who her ""real friend"" is seemed false. (Aside: we really didn't need to have Sandra's character come out and SAY that her housekeeper was the best friend she's got... the weepy eyes and the the hug was enough, okay? A little more subtlety at times like this would have definitely helped the movie.) And have I mentioned the music yet? Oh please, please, please, make it STOP! That pretentious ""angelic"" score just kept grating on my nerves the more I heard it. The movie is not all bad. Ludicrous's character steals the movie... personally I think they should have just followed him and Larenz Tate around for 2 hours and ejected some of those other subplots. The bedtime scene with the locksmith and his little girl was very sweet and touching in itself but I felt it was enormously cheapened by the later confrontation with the shopkeeper... it was no longer a scene about the characters but merely a ""set-up"" for a (contrived) ""pay-off"".",4.0,hokeybutt,2005/05/11,183,96

With Kevin Spacey sounding like Lex Luthor doing HAL 9000 and Sam Rockwell sounding like Sam Rockwell, who could ask for more? Welllll, if you're stuck on the moon, you may be satisfied. I was not on the moon and so I stayed because it was my choice. It ended up being one of the worst decisions I ever made. I was asking more questions about the sensibility of this story than I was asking about the characters and their purposes. The movie is advertised as Mystery, Sci-Fi and Thriller. IMO, there was never any thriller; the mystery died quickly when Rockwell's presence on the moon became nonsensical; Sci-Fi was not so Sci-Fi after all, but more of a delivery of Sociological Fiction. The scenery was one dimensional which, with a better story, may have been OK as a Twilight Zone episode. And, actually, it came across as a bad Twilight Zone rip-off. Spacey and Rockwell performed fine but I found it hard to appreciate their performances because the story was so bland. The intermittent jabs at humor were lost in the Moon's atmosphere. I went because I thought it was going to involve a good science fiction story. This is not good sci-fi. This is not good entertainment 2 out of 10",2.0,MovieZoo,2009/07/12,63,24

After 30 seconds, I was hooked and could not get away. This film needs to be seen, people need to understand the conditions and circumstances presented in it of urban school environments; the trials that teachers and students face everyday, and the ravages wrought by ""No Child Left Behind"". The role played by Sami Gayle is astonishing, where she found that character is beyond me.

504,Primal Fear,Great ending,"Primal Fear shows how good acting can sometimes outweigh problems in other areaslike logical loopholes large enough to sail a barge through, for example. The characters in this movie are so good that such difficulties just don't seem to matter. They can make not completely unexpected plot twists seem like classic surprise shockers. They can make a murder mystery story weighed down with all kinds of extraneous baggage like city political corruption and church scandals seem to flow like butter. I'm talking about GOOD acting! From the major to the minor parts, and everywhere in between. At center stage is defense lawyer Martin Vail (Gere) who will defend anyone of anything, especially if he stands to gain either financially or in TV exposure. So when a revered archbishop is brutally murdered, Vail offers his services to the frightened young man arrested for the crime. For free, no less. He knows this will be a sensational trial. But it turns out to be even more sensational than either Vail or we expect. And that is mostly due to newcomer Norton. He plays the defendant, a stuttering, seemingly simple Kentucky boy in the big city who protests his innocence, in spite of being found running from the murder scene covered in blood. Anyone who has liked Gere previously, even a little, will enjoy his performance here. But even those who don't particularly like him might be intrigued by Vail. He's slimy but intelligent, sexy yet occasionally vulnerable. It's the best role I've seen for him in a while (and I'm one of his fans). But Norton is really something else. He's got the kind of talent that makes you hope you can say, some years from now: ""Oh, yeah, I remember seeing his FIRST movie."" That's actually the best reason for seeing Primal Fear, now that I think about it. (Squeamish viewers might want to wait and see if his next film is less disturbing, though. Primal Fear includes some gory footage toward the beginning, and some disturbing sexual discussions, along with a pornographic ""video"" that is quite gross). And those minor characters are worth mentioning, too. You won't believe how creepy John Mahoney (""Frasier's"" funny dad) can be. Alfre Woodard is outstanding as the trial's judge. And Linney, although she's put in the trite situation of being Vail's former lover AND courtroom opponent, makes more of her character than you would expect.",10.0,charliellane-1,2008/03/11,14,10
505,Death of a Salesman,All About Family Dynamics,"You know how, sometimes, when the whole family gets together, it always seems to end in a shouting match or someone walking out in a huff? Family dynamics are some of the trickiest situations to deal with, and ""Death of a Salesman"" taps into those themes better than perhaps any other film. For a basic plot summary, this movie tells the story of Willy Loman (Dustin Hoffman), an aging salesman who may be starting to get a bit senile. Not helping matters is that, after decades of service to his company, he is being pushed out and unable to pay the bills. When Willy's sons Biff (John Malkovich) and Happy (Stephen Lang) come home after failing at their life's pursuits, they only ignite Willy's frustrations even more. Thrown in accommodating wife Linda (Kate Reid) and let the fireworks begin. When watching this movie, the first thing you have to do is remember that it is adapted from a stage play, and it plays that way on the big screen. They don't try to ""pump it up"" for Hollywood, but instead still rely on slight set pieces like a stage play would. It isn't ""bad effects"", but a conscious choice by director Volker Schlondorff. What the film lacks in visual effects, though, it more than makes up for with acting and themes. Hoffman and Malkovich play off each other perfectly, and this movie throws so many family- dynamic themes at you that it will take you some time even after the movie is finished to truly absorb and understand all of them. This is the kind of movie that doesn't lend itself to a brief review because one could take an entire semester of a college class and still not dissect all the themes. Suffice it to say, though, that you WILL relate to at least one of the characters (or know someone who IS one of them) and most of the family themes. Some movies are all about ""black and white"" themes of good and bad, but ""Death of a Salesman"" revels in its shades of grey. Though this movie is not ""dramatized"" enough for me to warrant a five-star rating, it is about as solid a four star movie as I've ever seen. The themes will leave you thinking about the movie for days afterwards.",8.0,zkonedog,2017/03/02,1,1
506,Horrible Bosses 2,"""Babies are like... potatoes with arms."" HAR HAR HAR","""Babies are like... potatoes with arms."" This is just one of the many scenes where Jason Sudeikis can't hold himself, breaks character and smirks at his own joke, in the early minutes of Horrible Bosses 2. Probably a sign of the horrors to follow. Along with scream-queen Charlie Day, Sudeikis plays a part of a trio of wannabe modern-day Stooges. The third part of the trio is Jason Bateman, who is forever doomed to play the straight man in comedy duos, trios and the rest. Not having seen the first movie, which I heard was actually funny, I went into this one with very little expectations. The plot involves the trio mentioned above, who come up with a simple product that could sell quite well and make them rich quick. But their investor is a cunning old fox, he screws them so bad that they're left with nothing. Nothing to do, except make him pay. While this sounds like a nice premise, what follows in the movie has little relation to it. This film could have the plot of Pulp Fiction, Citizen Kane or any Hitchcock film, and you still wouldn't remember anything about it afterwards. Charlie Day's constant screeching will drown out any thoughts you may have about the story. The main idea in a nutshell, the very basic concept of comedy that's being mass-marketed to audiences here, is this: ""Three guys talking and yelling all at once is funny."" How in the world this slipped through the meetings with the studio execs, the first drafts of the script, the later drafts, and afterwards slipped through the whole shooting process, without anyone noticing anything fishy about it, is a mystery. There are many, I mean MANY scenes in this film, ranging from 15 seconds to many long minutes, that consist of solely three guys yelling at once. Nothing else happens in these scenes, just constant yelling. It's impossible to understand anything that's being said, and if you happen to actually catch a word or phrase through all that noise, it's impossible to make out who said it. It doesn't matter, anyway. Because the big shots up there, holding the ropes to moviemaking for all the world to see, have decided that ""Three guys talking and yelling all at once is funny."" An example of the comedy routine, that's repeated many, many times throughout: Charlie Day starts yelling (you'd think his voice doesn't have any other mode) then the others join in the yelling... then Day suddenly shuts up and sits down extremely cool, like nothing happened, his hands on his lap, knees together, lips puckered, and... yes, you guessed it: eyes rolled up. Hello, and welcome to cheap comedy troupes from the 1920's. I almost expected a pie fight. Of course, the movie could still be somewhat funny if there were a few elements of real comedy, like well-written side characters. Like the Jamie Foxx character, ""MF Jones."" He's supposed to be very funny, and the audience is supposed to roll on the floor, breathless from laughter, because his name is MF. Get it? Now if you don't think a guy named MF is funny, you're missing what comedy is all about. Foxx doesn't utter a single funny line in his scenes. The whole premise of this character being funny is that his name is MF. Christoph Waltz, on the other hand, proves that he's one of the best, most convincing actors of our times. I've seen him on promotional interviews, saying ""...they (Sudeikis, Day and Bateman) are three of the funniest guys in show business."" And he said it without losing it. He didn't spit out his coffee or start laughing at his own words (unlike Sudeikis). He actually said this with a completely serious, straight face. His masterful acting was extremely out-of-place in a movie like this. Jennifer Aniston gives the strong impression that she was sick of her goody two shoes image from Friends and the by-the-book romantic comedies that followed, and craved to show audiences that she had a sexual side as well. She obviously wants to be recognized as a real hottie, a female, anything that is seen as a ""woman"", instead of ""Rachel"". Why wasn't I surprised that on the same promotional reels, the producers said ""She wrote some of the most explicit sexual lines herself"" ? You get the feeling that she'd even pay to have a role like this, rather than get paid. There is only one single line in the whole movie that's laugh-out-loud funny, and unfortunately it comes from Sudeikis, which made it somehow less funny. It's mind-boggling that he was given a part in these movies. He's never in character, he's Jason Sudeikis all along. I have never seen an actor so in love with himself, with his image, who finds himself so attractive and charming. He even surpasses Johnny Depp in that regard. A man who, if possible, would marry himself.",1.0,suicidea,2019/05/28,6,4

509,Horrible Bosses 2,An Admirable Second Best,"""Everybody's a critic,"" Bugs Bunny once said. In this case (as in most), the hare's correct. Perhaps folks are disenchanted by franchised laughter. The average rating amongst Top Critics (according to Rotten Tom) is a 4.5 out of 10. Though the more accurate portrayal's provided by the 'user' average: 7 stars. It's not due to a lack of proofreading that my score remains unaltered. This author's got a little something called integrity. Therefore the rating stays at 8; implying it's 'great', but perhaps not 'tremendous.' After all, 2014 is the year of the comedic sequel. Anchorman 2 was released last December and largely satisfied. The best comedic sequel of all time, 22 Jump Street came out in June. The long awaited Dumb and Dumber To wasn't great. Trepidatiously we await the follow-up to Hot Tub Time Machine on late February's horizon. Well, I say, ""To hell with top critics!"" Horrible Bosses 2 more than satisfies. Earning a coveted spot on Top Comedies of 2014 – 1. 22 Jump Street 2. Neighbors 3. The Interview 4. Let's Be Cops 5. Horrible Bosses 2 It keeps you guessing while offering a persistent snicker. The out-and-out laughs are numerous and frequent. The plot is timely, clever and not too outrageous. A considerable amount of social commentary is interwoven. Dare I say it's thought-provoking? Since viewing, I've ruminated on the panoramic time lapse and off-type car chase; so, there you have it. Thoughts provoked. The cinematography, shooting and editing are really impressive. As far as casting goes, this flick's top-notch. Jason Bateman, Charlie Day and Jason Sudeikis are all fantastic. Each lead is hilarious in his own individual way. I'll never understand why Bateman gets docked for his mastery as the 'straight' man. Plus, his Arrested Development version is more foolish softy. Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Aniston and Jamie Foxx return without disappointing. Christoph Waltz delivers in a minor role. Chris Pine, however, is terrific. He's great in Into the Woods as well, so hopefully we'll see more out of him in the future. There's a delightful blooper reel accompanying the rolling credits. As well as a fun character montage directly preceding. Such cinematic sequences are becoming more prevalent. They're enjoyable, informative and a welcome addition to any theatrical release. Let's call these bits 'character reels.' Best when featuring the character's image paired with both names (role and actor). Don't be disappointed if you missed HB Deuce while in theaters. For fans of the first, keep an eye on your streaming devices. It's available for pre-order through iTunes, but who's really going to shell $19.99 for digital ownership on release date? Wait for the rental. It'll be much cheaper and infinitely more satisfying.",8.0,stephenlovelette,2015/01/11,34,16
510,Primal Fear,The Excellent Debut of Edward Norton in a Great Thriller,"The archbishop of Chicago is slaughtered with seventy-eight stabs in his bedroom and the altar boy Aaron Stampler (Edward Norton) is arrested by the police force trying to escape from the crime scene covered by the archbishop's blood. He alleges that there was a third person in the room and he had fainted, and did not witness the cruel murder. The famous lawyer Martin Vail (Richard Gere) decides to defend Aaron, looking for the publicity of the case. His plea is that Aaron is not guilty. The story has many sub-plots, evolving powerful persons of Chicago society and their economical interests. The truth is revealed only in the last scene. This movie is the excellent debut of Edward Norton in the cinema industry. The complex story is great, but watching this movie for the second time, I noticed that there is a great flaw in the plot: neither Martin Vail nor Janet Venable (Laura Linney) have carried out any investigation with the other altar boys or the boys from the archbishop's savior house to know how was the behavior and the personality of Aaron Stampler in the daily life. The first time I saw this movie, I did not pay attention to this fact, but now I have realized that it would be very important to become aware about Roy and resolve the crime. My vote is nine.

511,Intermission,Funniest movie in a long time,"I laughed more at this movie than I have in a long time. When I read the synopsis on the DVD rental, I thought, this will be marginal at best, but gave it a try. Colin Farrell, while the show's big headliner, had just as much of a role as other actors in this movie. I only recognized a few other actors - Colm Meaney (Star Trek) and Shirley Henderson (Moaning Myrtle in Harry Potter) were also in this flick. But all of the actors really brought the humor to this show. With typical British humor, multiple plots are tied together with innuendo abounding. I had to use the subtitles on the DVD because of the accents, and actually had to work a little at it to understand some of the terms - like a ""ronnie"" - but this film sets up the scenes perfectly. Stay on top of the situations and who is involved in each of the sub-plots and you will find yourself belly-laughing. I may actually buy this DVD....",9.0,mashboo,2004/11/01,5,0

The documentary is a well-paced and engaging combination of talking heads and historical footage of the killer whales performing.

516,Moon,"Small in scope, Grandiose in concept","While book racks are brimming with thought provoking, high concept science fiction, the movie genre tends to be populated by invading aliens, intergalactic wars, and adventure, which makes Director and co-writer Duncan Jones' Moon that much more of an oddity. Not since Steven Soderbergh's much overlooked 2002 rendition of Stanislaw Lem's Solaris has a movie firmly rooted in the sci-fi realm delivered reflections on the human condition, which Moon does deftly. It tells the story of Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell), the only inhabitant of an automated lunar mining base extracting Helium-3 from lunar rocks to be shipped back to Earth to fuel the energy starved planet. Sam's isolated three year posting is about to come to an end and he longs to return to Earth to see his wife. His only company throughout this sojourn has been that of Gerty, the base's HAL-like robot voiced by Kevin Spacey. Unfortunately, the final weeks and days are proving to be the most difficult, and Sam finds himself going a bit squirrelly, leaving both he and the audience to wonder if what's unfolding is actually happening, or merely a drama taking place in his addled mind. That's about as much plot detail as I'm going to deliver, for to delve any deeper into the story would give too much away. Be prepared, however, for a thought provoking narrative that touches on issues such as scientific ethics, corporate greed, human identity, and compassion. There are no aliens, lasers/phasers, wormholes, warp engines or jump drives here, just a lonely space age concierge, an unflappable monotone robot, and a whole lot of fodder for your brain to chow down on. This is what science fiction was meant to be.",10.0,Craig_McPherson,2009/07/05,921,830
517,Interstellar,Mediocre,"Interstellar is mediocre. The story is chock full of cheap clichés (""Love is the 5th dimension!""), over-layered with arcane science for believability and story points that are never explained. The movie makes sense until Matt Damon. Up to that point, the quantum mechanics and astrophysics hold up, more or less. Although If you know you're going to age by 5 to 15 years on the water planet, why leave that one poor guy on his own? It's kind of heartless and that's when I started doubting the movie. But OK, fine. I can live with that. Then they head for the ice planet. And, all of a sudden, ""gravity is the force that transcends time"" and ""your mind fights death so you can see your children"". All downhill from there, way into deep space 9. The movie takes a turn for the worse: A nonsensical allegory about how humanity can be saved thanks to the power of love between a father and his daughter. It's endearing, but incomprehensible. Granted, the movie's pretty. So I gave it two stars. The actors? Love all of them. That's another 2. But I simply cannot live with a script that's nonsensical and full of stuff we're supposed to take at face-value, because it's Christopher Nolan, and he's an otherwise brilliant director: What was Michael Caine trying to not solve? What is all the research about? And, sci-fi directors: Please, drop the blackboard and chalk cliché. We technology people use computers now. Blackboards were useful when Newton was running things. Now? Not so much. It sounded like (but I'm not really sure) the five dimension bookcase, which lost me completely, was invented by humanity in a very distant future as a communications device. But then I also have to assume that that future humanity has really awesome technology if it can pull that kind of prowess. Then, why not simply invent a cellphone that can bridge time? Why not just send an email with the data component that's missing? Why would anyone have to take a chance taking a dive into a black hole to get it? And how is that future humanity saved anyway? And: How does the robot, whose location in space is never explained, come in possession of that data? And do 21st century communications really work in a black hole? Going back to the Michael Caine thing: What's the precious data component that he was missing? What does the ghost send in binary format to his daughter? (sounds to me like a lot of zeros and ones). And how does humanity get saved? Do they invent some sort of galactic Noah's ark to get people off the smoking pile of carcinogenic garbage that Earth has become? Could they not do that before? I'm sure they could. How does a human being in a space suit even survive flying into a black hole? Or maybe that's not what happened. I'm just not sure. The list goes on and on. the movie is a confusing hodge-podge of pseudo-philosophical-pseudo-scientific mess full of circular logic and loose ends. It's intended for (1) sci-fi dorks who tend to not over-think things (2) Nolan worshipers and lovers of all things shiny (3) movie ""buffs"" who enjoyed Cloud Atlas, which was more boring and more bizarre than Interstellar, but only slightly.",4.0,karelva,2014/11/06,417,184

Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, and James Franco reprise their roles as Peter Parker, Mary Jane Watson, Harry Osborn, respectively.Alfred Molina,Rosemary Harris and Donna Murphy co-star to play key supporting roles. Set two years after the events of Spiderman, the film focuses on Peter Parker struggling to manage both his personal life and his duties as Spider-Man.

Using his mechanical tentacles, Octavius is dubbed ""Doctor Octopus"" and threatens to endanger the lives of the people of New York City. Spiderman must stop him from annihilating the city. Boasting an entertaining villain and deeper emotional focus, this is a nimble sequel that improves upon the original.Due to this reason,it has become one of the best sequel ever made particularly of that of a superhero film.A lot of talent to lavish on a single movie, but the result is uncommonly smart for the genre, and not just smart but tremendously enjoyable.There are plenty of surprises in this compelling Hollywood cartoon-inspired movie that tops everything else in the genre especially as it improves on the first one in terms of action and comedy.Overall,it's a solid movie with some memorable moments.",10.0,Desertman84,2012/10/15,6,5

I don't comment on many movies but this one is by far one of the most underrated movies I have ever seen. Edward Norton, who no doubt is one of the most talented men alive, stole the screen in this crime drama about the alleged murder of the Archbishop of Chicago by an alter boy (Norton). The case is picked up by a defense lawyer (Gere) who was formerly employed as a prosecutor for the state of Illinois. The state prosecutor on the case (Linney) was intimately involved with Gere's character. This movie does not have a boring predictable story line up to the one twist at the end. The twist at the end is just icing on the cake with this clever film. Richard Gere's performance was outstanding. I am not a Richard Gere fan and I have no respect for him because of Runaway Bride (I still can't believe that anyone as talented as him could do such a film).

Every scene crackled. There was an energy, there was an effort put into every moment of the movie. No scene went on too long, no plot holes fell through. It was the comic, come alive. Sam Raimi and Tobey Maguire did a great job of making Peter Parker sympathetic, you feel for him, you wince with him, he is the boy, becoming a man, and you watch it, and you keep watching it. Even as a long-time fan who knew where some of the story lines were going- with MJ, with Harry Osborne- to see HOW the movie chose to play out these stories, provided great surprises for me, I almost wished I didn't know... I can't wait to see the reactions of my friends who haven't followed the Spider-man comics, the twist of the story and the hints at what is to come... A great movie. Great fun. Great story.

523,The Green Mile,"In 3 Words: Long, Intense, Involving","This was such an intense movie that, at three hours in length, I didn't really wind up watching this as many times as I thought I would. This was another of those films I rated very high on the first viewing but lower and lower on the second and third looks, finally eliminating it from my collection. However, that first look was a memorable one because this film had some dramatic moments! The acting in here is outstanding and runs the gamut from well-known actors like Tom Hanks to several unknowns, all having major roles. It's also nicely filmed. However, the story and the acting are the main attractions. The unique story gets you involved to the point where, even having to watch several very, very unpleasant scenes, you don't want to put the movie down. Big Michael Clarke Duncan elevated his career a lot with this role, playing ""John Coffey,"" a prisoner with strange powers. You could root for all the characters save two, a sadistic guard aptly named ""Brutus 'Brutal' Howell"" (David Morse) and Warden Hal Moores (James Cromwell). I was sorry to hear Cromwell blaspheme regularly but not surprised since he seems to have played so many ""bad guy"" roles in the past dozen years and done this in other films. With those two exceptions, however, it was nice to finally see prison guards as good guys, something rarely seen since the classic-movie era. Michael Jeter, one of those unknown actors, was a lot of fun to watch as ""Eduard Delacroix."" Overall, however, as much as I praise this movie, the unpleasant scenes, the high use of the Lord's name in vain and the length of it all make this a tough movie to watch over and over, but it's a movie to definitely see at least once. Let's put it this way: it gets your attention!",7.0,ccthemovieman-1,2006/09/28,35,14
524,Hotel Transylvania,A film that so desperately fills in bucketloads of childish gags in its scenes that neither do the characters move us nor does the film's humor and the music groove us,"Adam Sandler voices an overprotective control-freak Dracula who keeps his precious daughter Mavis (voiced by tween sensation Selena Gomez) within the confines of his behemothic mansion hotel-for-monsters Transylvania. Count Dracula despises human presence for reasons revealed later in the film, and so he cautions his fellow-monsters and daughter Mavis to be wary of their presence. On Mavis' 118th birthday, Count calls everybody to his abode and arranges for a party. Mavis' ultimate desire is to leave the palace and meet humans and she makes this birthday wish to her dad. Even though the wish is granted with conditions, Dracula has a back-up plan to get her back to him and keep her in control. All goes smoothly until an actual human named Jonathan (voiced by SNL regular Andy Samberg) checks in. Predictably, Jonathan and Mavis show fondness towards each other and Dracula now has to drive this human presence away before things get monster-messy. It is one thing to make a film that appeals to three year olds, but it is completely a different thing to make a film that seems to be written by three year olds; while in Case 1 you may get a charming movie that appeals to a wide audience, especially young children while in Case 2 you get a juvenile attempt unworthy to be shown even to the youngest audiences. Unfortunately, Hotel Transylvania falls under Case B; it is a film that so desperately tries to fill in as many childish gags as possible in its scenes that neither do the characters manage to move us nor does the humor and the music groove us. While almost every Pixar film (even the massively underrated Cars and its sequel) concentrates first on its plot and character development and then the dialogs and gags, Hotel Transylvania seems as if the writers first brainstormed as many kiddy jokes they could come up with and then put in characters to mouth each gag, and finally sketched some story in the background with dull, contrived colors. Take the first half of the movie: almost half of it is spent on introducing the various monsters and in many many many unfunny jokes. Once Jonathan arrives and explores the hotel along with the Count, we get nothing more than Jonathan trying to show what 'cool' is, hence more more more derivative jokes and situations. Characters keep tumbling in and out and the jokes really do not have anything to do with the main plot. Part two is not much different except for the development of the oversweet romance between Mavis and Jonathan and everything-going-wrong- to-be-set-right-by-the-main character situation. There also is a rap performance by our Count Dracula and vocal presence of singer Will.i.am which is really an emasculation-of-everything-worth-living-for-in-this- world terrible. Generally, I stay away from Adam Sandler and Eddy Murphy's movies because of their dicey reputation. I liked what I watched of Sandler's 50 first dates and Murphy's Beverley Hill Cop is a classic, but some of the recent outputs have notorious critical ratings and mixed audience opinions. Sandler only puts on a cheap accent and tries sounding as if the dialogs are actually funny, which is a very difficult task. Gomez is what Mavis or any cute-young-female-protagonist would sound like, therefore banal and I think animated film-makers should bring in unique voices for characters (Miley Cyrus' slightly hoarse voice worked in Bolt). Andy Samberg again has a voice suiting his character but what can he do without a good script or a skit? My advice: stick to R-rated D*** in A Box Part 2 with Timberlake and other such skits on SNL and not-to-forget more wicked Lonely Island albums instead of future collaborations with Sandler. A truly horrible decision (and one that really infuriated me) was putting that auto-tune Will.i.am bummer. While none of the other songs are worth any mention, Will.i.am's recent nasal exploitations stand out the most for all the wrong reasons. B.E.P did a wonderful job on their unfairly underrated incredibly catchy The E.N.D, but they went overboard with their auto-tune on their next album, the unlistenable The Beginning. The group is on a hiatus, and its lead male member Will.i.am is now working on his fourth album and some collaborations that again range from unmemorable (the David Guetta track) to obnoxious (Scream & Shout) to simply painful (This Is Love). His songs may be hits in clubs where there is a medley of crappy songs played at full volume and the only thing teenagers do is trying to outdo each other's dancing, but all the flavor is gone when these tracks are listened to as standalones – the heavy auto-tune and electronic beats smelling like burnt CDs. I know my rant above deviates from the movie but Will.i.am needs to stop messing up his music for want of money. The 3-D in Hotel Transylvania works not to great effect as the colors used in the film are mainly dark in shades like black, brown, grey, and dull white. Once they are screened in 3-D they get duller to a greater extent than colors like sky blue and bright red and yellow. A similar problem happened, but to a greater extent while watching Harry Potter and the Deathly-Hallows 2 where I felt I could have enjoyed the movie a lot more without the blasted 3-D (my city doesn't have a 2-D option for those not wanting 3-D). But the 3-D glasses had one benefit: I could figure out how much the film exasperated me by counting the number of times I took off my glasses and set them aside during the film. Adults, please take your kids for an upcoming Pixar film which has a higher probability of being good, and kids, please tell any of your parents not to take you for a film like Hotel Transylvania. Spend it on education or better films.",2.0,sashank_kini-1,2012/12/14,47,23
525,Blackfish,Excellent documentary,"Blackfish is a documentary about orcas at SeaWorld and the treatment of the orcas in captivity. Since this movie was released, SeaWorld has seen a major decline in business, so this documentary has had a big impact. Blackfish is constructed from archive footage and interviews only, so it's a very neutral documentary that never feels like it's been tampered with. As a result, it's a very authentic movie which feels truthful. The film becomes pretty gut-wrenching at times, and conveys its message very well. The interviews are well handled and the information delivered is clear and easy to understand, while the archive footage is well selected. Blackfish doesn't quite manage to avoid being biased despite its neutral approach. By failing to show both sides of the argument and seemingly making the same point repeatedly, this does ultimately feel overly heavy at times, so it's not a flawless documentary, but is a very good one which achieves its objective successfully and gets its point across. The impact it has had on SeaWorld is evidence of the documentary's skill, and while it's not the most lively and heart-pounding documentary out there, in many ways this adds to the experience and makes it more emotionally powerful by just giving the upsetting facts in an objective, authentic manner. You'll probably never look at SeaWorld the same way again, but this is a really good documentary and definitely worth a look. 8/10",8.0,Rickting,2016/02/17,8,7
526,The Green Mile,"I'm tired, boss ..","My mom told me to watch this movie, but i never gave it a try, because i assumed it was one of those melodramatic movies that's nothing special.. Boy was I wrong. The Green Mile is A SPECIAL movie in all aspects. It is magical to watch it, and even more magical when you understand it.The film had its funny moments, its very very tense and dark moments, its very very sad moments. The Green Mile has everything! The casting is top notch, everybody in here is giving their best and it shows. Tom Hanks is amazing, but he always is (one of all time greatest actors for me), but Doug Hutchison and Sam Rockwell as two of the worst human beings ever on film (on film because in a TV series it's Joffrey and Ramsay from GOT, you can never get worse than THAT! ) - Percy and Wild Bill, stole the show for me. Michael Clark Duncan as John Coffey is at his best - maybe one of the most heart-warming characters in movie history. The acting is incredible, the story is captivating, there were some very very disturbing scenes - The Delacroix execution is one of the most disturbing scenes in a drama-fantasy movie. Just so spectacurarly done, I cane never watch this scene without biting my tongue, so, so gruesome. And of course there is the John Coffey execution at which i shed a tear or two. I have never done that watching a movie in my life, movies can't get a tear out of me, but the scene and Michael Clarke Duncan's performance were incredible. You can't just stand there neutral to what happens, you just can't. I can't say it's the greatest movie ever, but it comes darn close to that. The only film that got me so sad, it must be something. Definately one of those films that you need to watch before you die, 3 hours were like 30 mins. Spectacular and one of the greatest films ever for me.

529,Taxi Driver,An Enigmatic Masterpiece,"If a picture is worth a thousand words then this movie (moving picture) is worth a million words, which is why it has probably generated at least a million words. What can one say. The obvious: that ""Taxi Driver"" is great, it is. That it is a masterpiece, it is. What sets this film apart from so many other films, including great films, is that it is an enigma. Every time I watch this film I see something else, I notice something else, I feel something else, I wonder something else. And I am, clearly, not the only one who reacts to the film this way that is why it lends itself to endless speculation and discussion. Since so many positive reviews have been made, rather than add my own red hot glowing review I thought I would address those people who have written that they don't like ""Taxi Driver"" because, they say, they find it dull and boring, hard to follow, etc. These people miss some important points about the film. ONE, ""Taxi Driver"" is NOT an action film. If you want an action film watch ""Die Hard"" and its numerous sequels, or ""Lethal Weapon"" and its sequels, not to mention ""Rambo"" and thousands of other ""action flicks."" Nothing wrong with them, per se. Nothing wrong with liking them either. But is wrong to put down ""Taxi Driver"" because of what it is not. TWO, ""Taxi Driver"" is about loneliness and loneliness is characterized by an almost crushing boredom and emptiness and Travis Bickle's character reflects that. His life is dull and boring, hardly anything happens to him and that is what ""Taxi Driver"" shows - Bickle's pathetic life. THREE, some people say that they don't understand the plot, Bickle's attitudes and behaviour, etc. But that is because ""Taxi Driver"" is about a man who is profoundly emotionally disturbed although he (and his buddies) don't seem to know it. His actions aren't rational because he isn't rational. His actions make no sense because he makes no sense. Offhand, I can't think of any other film that has depicted mental illness as well as ""Taxi Driver"" and no film that attempts to show the world as seen by someone like Travis Bickle. There you go: three reasons to address the most common criticisms of the film with one notable exception, its controversial ending, but THAT is a whole topic in itself which is just more proof of why ""Taxi Driver"" is so worthwhile - when viewers aren't sure what actually happens in the end (Is Travis hallucinating as he is dying? Is that what the slow moving overhead tracking shot suggests? Or does he really become a hero in the media and get realeased back into the world with his buddies? Etc, etc.) The questions and issues raised by ""Taxi Driver"" just go one and on. Now if after reading the above you still don't think ""Taxi Driver"" is a great film, I can't help you. I am NOT saying you have to like (or love) ""Taxi Driver"" just appreciate it or at least acknowledge its greatness even if it isn't your cup of tea. Actually, I don't love ""Taxi Driver"" because it doesn't lend itself to love. It is too disturbing a picture precisely because it is way too close to reality, it cuts too close to the bone for my comfort (or rather, discomfort). It is not comfortable to watch because it isn't supposed to be. So if ""Taxi Driver"" makes you feel uncomfortable and uneasy it should because real life is uncomfortable and uneasy (unless you are born rich or something). Finally, after watching it again for the nth time I have begun to notice (and feel) just how smooth ""Taxi Driver"" is. The overall feel and flow of the film is incredibly smooth in which not only each scene but each and every movement and gesture flows into the other imperceptibly. Sometimes I play back scences and sequences over and over to catch how it happens. In fact, I see it happening and still can't quite figure out how it is done but I have a hunch - DeNiro. DeNiro is just amazing in this film. If you haven't done it already, watch it with the remote in your hand and play some of the scenes in slow motion and you will SEE what I am talking about. Only DeNiro could do what he does. The sheer minimalism of his performance is just stunning. How he gets so much from so little never ceases to amaze me. DeNiro's performance in ""Taxi Driver"" only reminds me of what sports announcer Curt Gowdy exclaimed after one of Baltimore Orioles third baseman Brooks Robinson's incredible plays in the 1970 World Series,""This guy is another world!""",,JosefSerf,2004/05/04,331,254

531,Moon,Brilliant low budget sci-fi thriller,"I had to travel from cheadle to Manchester just to see this film but id say it was worth it, it was amazing Sam Rockwell is a brilliant actor and Duncan Jones should be getting more work as a director now that this film is out the effects although low budget looked better than some of the crap CGI effects they put in most films now and this films should also be the re-start of a few low budget sci-fi movies that hopefully be released over the next couple of years to give new directors a chance at being famous and hopefully making good films the only bad thing is that its pretty easy to see that they clone the guy before you see the end but its still a great movie all the same",9.0,nathan-408,2009/08/01,22,11
532,Moon,"Curiouser and curiouser, though this might be familiar territory for sci-fi buffs","Moon (2009) At first this will seem like a poor man's 2001: A Space Odyssey, then with a touch of the American Solaris thrown in. But it's grittier, and has an everyman quality rather than an ethereal one, and so it makes you sympathetic as well as curious. Curiosity is a big part of this kind of movie, where you are on the moon (literally) and don't know quite why, or how it works, or how it is that a single person (Sam Rockwell) could be operating this sprawling operation (one of many implausibilities you just overlook). The HAL-like robot (with the voice of Kevin Spacey, no pun there, I suppose) is made less sinister and cuter, for sure (and dirtier, a nice touch) but his role takes on some nice twists later, so in a way, there are two characters. Or maybe three, or four, depending how you look at it--I'll not give that away. None of this is flawless. If the everyday qualities make you comfortable with the lead character, they also make the tension and bizarreness less intense. There are moments when I think we should be just blown away, and yet (maybe because we've seen this in other movies too often) we are just made to perk up a little. The movie is, in fact, interesting, and it's not overlong, and so it does succeed. It just doesn't find the beauty, or sci-fi wonder, or human tragedy, of a great movie, whatever that might be. Maybe some people will discover some ideas about life and identity spelled out here for the first time, and in that case this could be a completely memorable, even meaningful experience. I hope so. Otherwise, it's still a fun, well made, different experience. And Rockwell, in the lead role(s), lets it all hang out. Impressive acting.",7.0,secondtake,2010/02/07,14,7
533,The Chorus,Music Changed Their Lives,"On 15 January 1949, the former music teacher Clément Mathieu (Gérard Jugnot) arrives in ""Fond de l' Etang"" (""Bottom of the Well""), a boarding school for orphans and problematic boys, to work as an inspector. The place is administrated with iron fist by the cruel director Rachin (François Berléand), and most of the boys have severe punishments for their faults. Clément decides to teach the boys to sing in a choir in their spare time, and identify the musical potential of the rebel Pierre Morhange (Jean-Baptiste Maunier), the son of a beautiful single mother for whom he feels a crush. He also has a special feeling for the young Pépinot (Maxence Perrin), a boy that expects the visit of his father every Saturday near the gate, but indeed lost his parents in the war. With his methods, Clément changes the lives of the boys, of the other employees and his own. ""Les Choristes"" is a very simple, but also sensitive movie. I personally like both of the central themes, teaching and music, and this delightful movie was very special for me. This beautiful feel-good story is disclosed in a perfect pace, with great performances of the cast, and with a wonderful surprising twist practically in the last scene as if it were a fairy-tale. The songs are adorable and I recommend this movie to viewers that like a simple, touching and very real story. My last advice is to keep a handkerchief close to you for the last heartbreaking scene. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): ""A Voz do Coração"" (""The Voice of the Heart"")",8.0,claudio_carvalho,2006/01/20,14,7
534,October Sky,Made-For-Tv Film invades theaters,"October Sky is one of the most average films in recent memory. It moves from cliche to cliche without a care in the world because the film itself is a cliche: if you work hard enough, you will be rewarded. You get all the elements that work against our unlikely hero, such as a tough father and skeptical friends, as well as some unexpected advantages, like a helpful teacher and a resident genius friend. The movie stumbles through these situations and banks that the audience will buy it because it is based on a true story. And it seems like it has worked because most viewers seem to like the film. There were some fine elements in the film. Chris Cooper is Hollywood's most underrated actor. His performance as the father could have been very flat, but instead he allows him to be a three dimensional man. The development of the relationship between the father and son is nice, if not a little Freudian. The other performances are nice too, but nothing special. Laura Dern, another underrated performer, is given a terrible, underwritten role, but she does the best she can. Also, the film does end much better than it begins. The first 75 minutes have a lot of silly setpieces, like ""let's play on the train tracks like in Stand By Me"" and ""let's find our lost rocket even if the relevance to the plot is no longer clear"". The end of the film really comes together, though, by focusing on the father-son relationship and the futures of the boys once they get out of that dreadful town. One final note is in order. I believe that the film was completely unfair to unions and intentionally tried to make them look evil. Why is everyone associated with the union leadership portrayed like a wild, snarling animal? Could it be that the entire film is a quiet piece of right-wing propaganda? Does anybody really believe that if we just follow our dreams that everyone has an equal chance in America? These are just a few final thoughts, and they ultimately do not impact on my overall appraisal of the film, which I give a 6.",6.0,Dr.Mike,1999/03/29,12,8
535,Interstellar,Going brilliantly (but very LOUDLY) into the dark,"Wowser! This Christopher Nolan film was presaged with such marketing hype that I went in with pretty low and cynical expectations. But I was frankly blown away with it. Just about everyone raves about Christopher Nolan's work, and you look back at his Filmography and it makes for a pretty impressive resume: from Memento via the (rather over-hyped imho) Dark Knight Batman series-reboot through to Inception, one of my favourite films of all time. For me, Interstellar is right up there with Inception for thought-provoking, visually spectacular and truly epic cinema. We start in familiar 'Day after Tomorrow"" territory, with mankind having in some way – not entirely explained – messed up the planet. As I understood it (and the film probably does require multiple watches with – see comments below – subtitles=on) the rather clever premise is that the world's food supplies are being progressively destroyed by a vindictive 'blight'. This delivers the double whammy of destroying mankind's provisions but also, by massive reproduction of the organism, progressively depleting the Earth's oxygen. For some reason – again, which I didn't get on first viewing – this is accompanied by massive dust storms. It is a morbid bet as to what is going to get the mid-West population first: starvation, lung disease or suffocation. Matthew McConnaughey plays the widowed Cooper, an ex-NASA drop out turned farmer given the opportunity by mission-leader Professor Brand (an excellent Michael Caine) to pilot a NASA mission. The goal is to punch through a mysterious wormhole in space where they suspect, through previous work, that a new home for mankind could be found. The first part of the film is set on and around Cooper's farm, setting in place one of the emotional wrenches at the heart of the film: that Cooper in volunteering for the mission and having to leave behind his elderly father (John Lithgow, again superb) and young children Murph (aged 10) and Tom (aged 15) whilst recognising that danger for him comes not just from the inherent risks involved but from the theory of relativity that could change everything, time-wise, for when he returns. Cooper is supported on the mission by a team of scientists including Brand's daughter played by a love-struck Anne Hathaway, who again shows she can act. To say any more would spoil what is a voyage of visual and mental discovery. (However, I would add that it is good to see that the character that plays my namesake Dr Mann (in a surprise cameo) is equally good looking! LOL). In terms of plus points, where do I start? The visuals are utterly stunning. Whilst reminiscent in places of Kubrick's ""stargate"" from 2001, the similarity is only passing. The film adds a majesty and scale to space that surpasses wonder. Elsewhere there are some interesting visual effects: this might have just been me of course, but after the dramatic launch there was something about the camera moves during the first scenes of weightlessness that made me feel genuinely nauseous. Equally stunning is Hans Zimmer's score which is epic and (in places) very VERY loud. The film certainly doesn't ""go quietly into the night""! When matching the noise of the score/choir to the sound effects in the launch sequence the combination is ear-bleedingly effective. This must be a strong contender for the soundtrack Oscar for 2014. One quibble, again 2001 related, is that Zimmer uses the last chord of Also Sprach Zarathustra in the score sufficiently often that one hopes Richard Strauss's estate receives some royalties! The acting is top notch: I've already mentioned Caine and Lithgow, but McConnaughey, Hathaway and Jessica Chastain are all great. A particular shout-out should go to Mackenzie Foy as the young Murph, who is magnetically charismatic and just brilliant in the role. Above all, Nolan's direction is exquisite. The film has a slow build on earth (which adds to the lengthy running time) but defines the characters and primes the plot perfectly. And some of the editing cuts – again, Cooper's farm departure/launch sequence overlay is a great example – are superb in building the mood and the tension. I've decided that I am an extremely tough reviewer and for me a 10 star film is a rarity indeed. Where I could have knocked off a star was in some of the dialogue on the soundtrack, which was pretty inaudible in places: McConnaughey in particular with his general mumbling and strong southern accent is indecipherable in places. I look forward to the DVD subtitles. And one of the character's dying words – delivering a key plot point in the film – was completely lost to me (but thankfully later restated). Whilst the expansive plot is highly ambitious, the end of the film, playing fast and loose with physics I fear, requires a gravity-defying suspension of belief (although I guess the same could equally be said of 2001: A Space Odyssey). However, the film has stayed so firmly lodged in my mind for 24 hours I will make a rare exception to my rating 'rule'. Overall, this is a top-notch Sci-Fi film. And a final word: PEOPLE THIS IS A MUST SEE ON THE BIG SCREEN! (If you enjoyed this review, please see my archive of previous reviews at bob-the-movie-man.com and sign up for future notifications.

536,Intermission,Thoroughly Entertaining,"I've seen so many movies just like Intermission--a not so linear plot with dozens of memorable characters, connected through wild coincedence. I've seen the style before: jolty handhelds and low grade film. Intermission, in many ways, is the prototypical postmodern film. Yet, I really don't care. From beginning to end, I enjoyed this film. I was intrigued by the characters and their various dilemmas with love, sex, and power. Dramatized by some of the best actors in the Isles, the characters never bored me, nor did they feel too showy. A nice balance was struck, and an interesting plot was forged out of the chaos. Basically, the film centers around a cluster of Dubliners: a tough as nails police officer, a brutal criminal, a disenchanted grocery store worker, his ex-girlfriend and her married, middle-aged rebound guy, a bus driver, and many others. Drawn from their trials and tribulations are existential kernels of knowledge: say what you want, live your life to the fullest of its possibilities, don't let the past dominate you, don't let authority dominate you, etc... It's a wonderful film in terms of character and theme, and the dialog was superb. The only reason it loses any points at all is because the structure has been done many times before. Still, it works for the plot. I recommend it to anyone who hopes for a relaxing night out! Rating: 9 out of 10",,lola541,2004/04/29,6,0
537,Primal Fear,A superior courtroom drama with a star-making turn from Edward Norton...,"PRIMAL FEAR was a surprisingly effective courtroom drama which will always have a place in history because of the electrifying performance from Edward Norton in his first major role. Norton is nothing short of astonishing as a former Chicago alter boy who has been accused of murdering a celebrated priest with a checkered past. Richard Gere has one of his best roles as Martin Vale, an arrogant yet capable attorney who agrees to defend Norton because of what the victory would do for his resume more than belief in the young man's innocence. It is the complicated twist and turns of the trial, Gere's surprisingly solid interpretation of a rather complex character and most of all, the amazing performance of Edward Norton, which earned him an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor that, that make this film sizzle. Mention should also be made for a strong supporting cast including Laura Linney as the prosecuting attorney and former protégé of Vale's, Alfre Woodard as the judge, Frances McDormand as a court-appointed therapist, and Andre Braugher as Vale's leg man. Steve Shagan's solid screenplay and Gregory Hoblit's uncompromising direction are the final touches on one of the better courtroom dramas of the 90's but what you really go away from this film remembering above all else is the performance by Edward Norton that made him a star.",7.0,Isaac5855,2008/02/14,7,6
538,Crash,Good Picture? Yes. Best Picture? No way.,"I like this movie. It gives the viewer something to think about. It has a few outstanding performances (Matt Dillon, Ludicrous) and some weak performances (Ryan Phillipe). All that aside, this movie never departs from feeling didactic and --well--like you are being subjected to a moral tale. Other movies have done this: If These Walls Could Talk, American History X, those safe driving videos I watched in drivers education years ago. It's not wrong for movies to solicit a morality. It's just difficult to escape that and find an artistic harbor, too. (I feel that American History X did a much better job getting cinema legs under it then Crash did, for that matter.) Overall, this movie was good but never reached the free-wheeling levels of cinema brilliance that movies like Brokeback and Capote did this year. The ""Academy"" giving the nod to this movie is laughable and misguided. The academy's vote makes it painfully obvious that 3000 of the 4000 Academy members live in Los Angeles and don't think for themselves.",7.0,dogma302,2006/03/06,69,40
539,Blackfish,Wake-up slap in the face,"I will just mention one instance from the documentary and you think about it. There is a short mentioning of how a trainer used to train Orcas that were new to the park by putting them together with older, trained Orcas and asking them to perform the same tasks. When they, inevitably, failed, both animals were punished by being deprived of food. So the older, trained Orca, took it out on the younger, untrained one. Now, sit back and think about the same tactic being employed by human parents against their children. ""I don't know who did it, but you are both grounded"". There you go – a documentary about whales in captivity that taught you something about your own wrong methods of parenting. Aside from that, when you are done watching this, you will probably and justifiably never want to go to a marine park show with Orcas ever again. The documentary just works as a wake-up slap. We separate a baby whale calf from its mother and social structure, keep it as grown, 5 ton, apex predator in a pool for its entire life and milk it for its semen. If you ask me, Orcas must be the most mellow creatures on earth, for them to have only killed this few people in captivity You want to see Orcas?

540,The Wailing,"A Diabolical Work Of Mythic Weirdness That's Drenched In Blood, Sickness & Devilry","After catapulting himself into the league of South Korea's brightest up-n-coming filmmakers with his extremely polished & mercilessly violent directional debut and then following it up with another thriller that was more or less a misfire, director Na Hong-jin makes a splendid return to form after six years of inactivity, and delivers a cinema that's drenched in blood, sickness & devilry. The story of The Wailing unfolds in a small South Korean village where a mysterious illness begins to spread & claim many lives after the arrival of a strange Japanese man in the nearby mountains. Investigating the case is a police officer who becomes all the more involved after his own daughter begins exhibiting similar symptoms and enlists the help of a shaman to solve the mystery before its too late. Written & directed by Na Hong-jin, The Wailing finds the budding filmmaker stepping into the realms of supernatural horror and features numerous elements that made his first film an instant classic. It is a considerable improvement over Hong-jin's previous film, plus his direction exhibits more confidence & comfort this time. The script is just as impressive although it still could've used a bit more refinement. The film doesn't hold back on violence & gore and keeps the element of doubt alive until the very end. Also admirable is how successfully it manages to force its viewers to switch their allegiance from time to time and keeps them in the dark throughout its runtime. Humour is brilliantly utilised whenever it's required but the tone is grim for the most part and only intensifies as the plot nears its conclusion. The technical aspects are finely executed. The rural setting & isolated surroundings provide a big enough canvas for the horror to play out. Camera-work is expertly carried out, filming each n every moment in fine detail. Editing is definitely a highlight, given the unpredictable nature of its plot in addition to unforeseen twists n turns, and despite its 156 minutes runtime, it is never boring and is actually cleverly paced from beginning to end. Coming to the performances, the entire cast chips in with apt contributions in their given roles and play their part responsibly. Kwak Do-won plays the police officer investigating the mystery illness & killings and although a comic relief at first, he wises up as the plot progresses. Hwang Jung-min is in as a shaman and goes bonkers with his role. But the two most measured inputs comes from Jun Kunimura & Chin Woo-hee who play the Japanese stranger & a mysterious woman respectively. On an overall scale, The Wailing is a fresh, fascinating & ferocious entry in the world of horror that makes terrific use of its atmosphere & supernatural elements to deliver a thoroughly unsettling & consistently engaging experience. There are, however, times when it may leave you a little lost or unsure of what's happening but the interest is never lost for once and only gains momentum as it heads towards its long-awaited finale. A work of mythic weirdness that's diabolical in every sense of the word, The Wailing comes highly recommended.",,CinemaClown,2017/01/26,12,6
541,The Chorus,Ordinary and glowing,"The film uses a retrospective approach to retrospectively trace the past through an accidental visit by Pierre Peppino to Pierre. On the outskirts of a small town, there is such a junior school full of strict systems. The students in this school are basically a group of uneducated children who can only use force to solve problems. However, no one knows that in the young minds of such seemingly hopeless children, one by one, the wonderful dreams are quietly sublimating. With such naive dreams, they met someone who was arguably enough to change their destiny-he was Matthew. It was he who discovered the strengths of these children and let them find their own ""spring"" A group of children thought to be abandoned and laissez-faire regained hope and found their own interest in singing; those paper planes with children's blessings of separation appeared at the right time; the one waiting at the door from the beginning Dad's Peppino finally found ""Dad"" on Saturday. When Matthew left alone, the hand that only stretched out the window and the falling note made the audience impressed. Matthew may not be a good musician, but he is definitely a good teacher. He gave the children hope with music, guided them back to the right path, and saw their own ""spring."" The power of art expressed in this movie is so great that it can save countless stubborn souls.",9.0,zeekwunlau,2020/03/28,0,0
542,The Chorus,La Cage Aux Rossignols .......... in colour !!!!,"I caught up with this one recently on DVD in Paris as I missed it when it came out and I was pleasantly surprised ! Of course it should be stated that it is just a remake of a 1940's film starring a very famous French actor called Noël-Noël, and called ""La Cage Aux Rossignols"". The principal actor in that film even had the same name as in Jugnot's film, Clément Mathieu. The DVD issued here has neither French subtitles for Deaf/Hard of hearing French nor foreign language subtitles to attract viewers from other countries .... it's indeed a very strange way to promote a film !! The subject matter has been dealt with before in other films so there is nothing new under the sun ..... that said, the film is very pleasant to watch and we become attached to each of the characters in their own way. Using the ""flashback"" technique, such as in Goodbye Mr Chips, Cinema Paradiso, The BRidges of Madison County and other such films plays on the viewer's heartstrings because at the beginning of the film, all we are about to see is over, finished, part of the (distant) past and we have the nostalgic privilege to re-live that past thanks to the magic of cinema ......... The film was made in the Château de Ravel, situated in the Auvergne region of Central France, between Clermont Ferrand and Riom in the Puy-de-Dôme department. The Château de Ravel now has its own internet site which makes ample reference of cours to Les Choristes. I was glad to have this film on DVD and will be sure to watch it several times more. My only qualms were with the choice of musical numbers - indeed I didn't know any of them - and they may indeed have been composed just for the film. As to the name of the school ""Le Fond de l'Etang"" or the Depths of The Pond, I assume it was chosen to represente ""an out of the way"" or ""lowest of the low"" type school !! Sordid types of schools like these have been seen in other French films, in addition to La Cage aux Rossignols, there is ""Les Diaboliques"", ""Le Diable Au Corps"", and last but not least ""Au Revoir Les Enfants"" by Louis Malle. I am not really sure whether the film will have success on a world basis - there is nothing typically French about it - but it does make for good watching and many spectators will be able to relate to it. On the other hand, it doesn't really have the extra little something which makes it stand out above other films ..... we shall have to let ""nature"" take its course and see the end result.",,nicholas.rhodes,2004/11/21,8,4
543,The Fault in Our Stars,A Beautiful Love Story: Going to love it for the longest of the infinity,"'Some infinities are bigger than other infinities' says my favorite quote from the movie (and the book) and its true because I am going to love this movie for the longest of the infinity. I am a huge fan of the book and one thing which really makes the movie stand out is an amazing performance by Shailene Woodley. She is outstanding in every scene she is and I have to say I am kind of in love with Hazel. Even though its a love story of a girl who has terminal cancer I wouldn't say that the film is tragic rather the film is about living your life to the fullest in your 'little infinity' If you have already read the book, the film is true to the book and the great acting, directing and music adds another dimension to the story. The Fault In Our Stars is definitely one of the best romantic movies ever. When you see this movie you are going to laugh and you are going to cry and when the end credit roles I can guarantee most of you are going to be completely in love with this love story.",10.0,AniConrad,2014/07/21,165,128

545,Goodfellas,One Of The Best Movies EVER,"Most of the time when i see a good movie I come to IMDb, and read some user comments. I like to read the negative ones, to see how STUPID people are. Well today after i saw this movie (i'm 20 years old, but never saw this movie before - shame) i wanted to see what do other people say about it. This movie deserves 11/10 stars. I really REALLY don't know why didn't it got an Oscar, but it's pity. Now 1 IDIOT user wrote ""why do people rate movies like this so high?"" The only thing i can say is: Dude, life is not only pink and furry, you have to look at the other side of life, the dark side. In this movie you will find a superb story of how was life back then, when the mobs ruled all. Violence is this guys problem... Dude, take a look around, and see for yourself. There is MUCH MUCH more violence nowadays then there was back then, sad but true. And at the end of the movie Ray really broke my heart: he ordered spaghetti and sauce, and he got ketchup with cheap noodles - NOTHING is like it was back then.. EVERYTHING is falling apart, we eat junk food, have to ""wait in line"", quality of products drop, no good music... (just compare the Mercedes cobra to a new E class.. cobra's simply wouldn't break down - Mercedes almost got bankrupted - new cars, in 5-8 years u have to change em) but lets get back to the movie. Another user wrote ""WHY IS THIS BETTER THAN THE MATRIX? MATRIX IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER.."" well i don't know what to say.. simply no comment. How old are you kid? 13? Matrix.. good movie, but Goodfellas is 1000x better. You will find action, good story, betray, love and all in this movie. Tommy would kill you if he would read that matrix is better lol. and the most important thing is, that it is TRUE STORY. Geee... i wish i could live in the 50-60's. real life, true friends.

546,The Fault in Our Stars,Not your banal weepie; far better,"Over the last couple of decades, terminal-disease-at-youthful-romances are dime-a-dozen in the proliferated Korean flick market, escalating audience symptoms from indigestion to constipation. ""The fault in our stars"", you probably have heard, despite the subject matter, is not one of those. There is one very interesting quote (the circumstances for which are incidental and omitted here): between the 3 of us, we have 5 legs, 4 eyes and 2.5 pair of lungs. The three people are the protagonists Gus (Ansel Elgort, with a smile that wins all), Hazel (Shailene Woodley) and Gus's delightful sidekick Isaac (Nat Wolff, equally delightful), all cancer patients. Gus had one leg amputated from just above the knee; Hazel for all intents and purposes has a plastic oxygen tube anchored to her nostrils all the time (oxygen supplied by a portable cylinder she drags around); Isaac had lost his left eye at the beginning of the movie and then loses the right in the middle of it. Gus has been free from a relapse for a few years; Hazel's situation is ""stable""; while sacrificing both eyes appeared to have preserved Issac's life. But unfortunately, as we all know, nothing is really certain in the fantastic realm of cancer-land. Gus and Hazel meet at a cancer support group and eventually fall in love. This is not something new to the cinematic world so I won't elaborate the details. One thing I want to say is Woodley and Elgort have set a new bar for the meaning of ""chemistry"" in acting together. Separately, they are equally superb. On Hazel's side, another wonderful dimension is in Laura Dern's top-notch portrayal of Hazel's mother Frannie. While this is not a particularly manipulated tearjerker, tear will flow, even more so in the mother-daughter scenes than the lovers' scenes. (additional SPOILER warning) What makes this movie stand out, however, is the reality and cruelty it does not hold back from depicting. A lot of movies with a similar theme would have as the focal point a ""last wish"" sort of scenario, unabashedly manipulated to give an uplifting conclusion. In ""faults"", Hazel has a dream which Gus and Frannie help to realize â€“ to visit an author named Van Houten (a brilliantly casted Willem Dafoe) in Amsterdam. Hazel, in her sickness, clings to a book by Van Houten about a girl who eventually died of cancer. What Hazel (and Gus also) wants to do is ask Van Houten face-to-face when happened to the rest of the people surrounding the girl after her death. To cut a long story short, the three have a dream-like trip to Amsterdam where the young couple is treated to a romantic dinner by the author before the fateful visit the next day. This is where the movie shines: a rude awakening that all these nice correspondence and gestures are offered only by the author's kind-hearted mate. Van Houten turns out to be an obnoxious, ultra-cynical drunk, to such an extent of extracting from our lovely heroine the only four-letter word that appears in the entire movie. All these happen only in the middle of the movie. Ironically, this ""common enemy"" becomes a trigger for the young couple to let go of all their inhibitions and let their love flow. The rest of the movie follows a somewhat familiar trajectory. There is a plot twist which may be unfamiliar to some but I, for one, have seen it elsewhere. Doubtless, there will be discussions emerging from the theatre surrounding thing such as what makes Hazel and Gus tick, is Van Houton truly a villain or just a realistic depiction of a normal human being etc etc. But one thing is certain: you would want to see more of Shailene Woodley's movies, the ""Divergent"" series aside. Something Oscar-worthy.",,harry_tk_yung,2014/08/05,8,4
547,Interstellar,Has Its' Flaws But Still Found it Pretty Awesome,"At over 2100 reviews at the time of this writing, I guess there's nothing left to be said other than my opinion. I'd probably need a PhD in Physics from MIT to understand half of the technological terms in the movie, but I still found it to be rather awesome. After reading some of the reviews here, I think a lot of people are taking this sci-fi fantasy tale way too seriously and literally. Christopher Nolan's latest, which he co-wrote as well with his brother Jonathan, at 2 hrs and 48 min in length, can be ridiculously absurd one moment then quickly turn into riveting action the next. Matthew McConaughy and Anne Hathaway lead a long list of screen notables here, too numerous to mention. I did want to mention that I thought Mackenzie Foy, as Murph, the 10-year-old daughter of McConaughy was terrific in her role. I thought the musical score here was excellent, the wit and humor of the robot TARS (Bill Irwin) was on target. the special effects could be rather hokey at times but then other times were amazing, and the movie did contain a number of twists and turns which I liked. All in all, despite its' drawbacks I found this sci-fi fantasy to be a rather awesome and epic ride.",9.0,larrys3,2015/04/03,52,28

549,Blackfish,Hard-hitting and extremely disturbing,"When my children were young, we went to the killer whale (orca) shows at the Vancouver Aquarium. It was fun to see the 8,000+ pound whales doing tricks for the trainer while the audience was being splashed. We gave little thought, however, to how the whales felt about it. Today, millions who attend SeaWorld shows watching the killer whales perform in San Diego, Orlando, and San Antonio also pay little heed to either the danger to the trainers or the frustration of the animals that have been confined to an area the size of a swimming pool for up to twenty or thirty years. These conditions are depicted in Gabriela Cowperthwaite's hard-hitting and extremely disturbing documentary Blackfish, the name given to orcas by the First Nations. While the film provides no new information, putting it all together makes a powerful case against the whales' confinement. Interviewed are former Sea World trainers who do not hesitate to talk about the misinformation they were told to tell audiences about orcas' lifespan and fins (which routinely collapse in captivity) and the great benefit whales experience at SeaWorld. According to the former trainers, the killer whales are social creatures that live with their families all of their life. When they are forced to separate in order to ""introduce new breeding options to other SeaWorld parks and by fulfilling entertainment and other husbandry needs,"" their heartbreaking cry simulated in the film will stay with you. Trainers and whale experts talk about the intelligence and beauty of these animals and how they can live many years longer in the wild. According to Biologist Debbie Giles, in the wild, their estimated maximum life span is 60-70 years for males and 80-90 years for females. In captivity, most orcas die in their teens and 20s and only a handful have made it past 35. The former SeaWorld trainers also talk about the whales' aggressive behavior directed against each other when they are subjected to overcrowding. The film centers on a particular whale, the 12,000 pound Tilikum, who has been involved with the deaths of three SeaWorld trainers since 1991, events captured on amateur home video. Beginning in 1983 as a two-year-old, Tilikum performed at the Sealand of the Pacific Park in Victoria, B.C., where he was jammed into a holding area along with two other female whales each night when the park closed. This abuse continued until the inevitable occurred when a trainer was killed in 1991 with Tilikum's participation, though he did not instigate the attack. After the incident, the owner mercifully closed the park and Tilikum was shipped to SeaWorld in Orlando, Florida. Although SeaWorld said that the whale would only be used for breeding purposes, he continued to be part of the show and continues to this day. This in spite of the fact that another death occurred in 1999 when a man evaded security to enter the park at night, and in 2010 when a highly-skilled senior trainer, Dawn Brancheau, was mauled to death by a whale she had a long-term relationship with, an incident SeaWorld attributed to ""trainer error."" In discussing these attacks, the film asserts that no attacks against humans have been documented when the orcas are in their natural habitat, swimming hundreds of miles each day in the open seas (though some sources claim there have been two). In 2006, however, ABC reported that there had been nearly two dozen attacks in captivity worldwide. Recently a judge, recognizing the potential danger to trainers, ordered SeaWorld to place a barrier between the trainers and the whales. SeaWorld is appealing. Though Blackfish is one-sided and aggressive in its advocacy, SeaWorld was given an opportunity to present its case but declined, calling Blackfish ""inaccurate and misleading."" Cowperthwaite said that she approached her documentary as a journalist with an open mind and that her point in making the film was not to shut down SeaWorld but to provide the context for humane treatment for the whales and to prevent additional deaths at marine theme parks. ""The film is a truthful document,"" she says, and SeaWorld is ""an industry based on fairy tales."" Since the documentary's release, entertainer Willie Nelson, and rock groups Heart and Barenaked Ladies have cancelled shows at SeaWorld in protest.",9.0,howard.schumann,2013/12/16,17,14
550,Goodfellas,A true classic,"This is the gangster film at its finest. Scorsese is on top form as are Pesci and De Niro. Liotta has never bettered the performance he gives here. The film starts as it means to go on - violent, full of profanity, fast paced and very stylish. The story follows Liotta's character from boy to man as he climbs his way up through the ranks of organised crime. We see all the highs and lows of his life and meet a host of very believable and very undesirable characters along the way. It's a film full of memorable scenes whilst remaining much more than the sum of its individual parts at the same time. This is what all movies should be like. It draws you in and won't let you out of its grasp at any point. When it finishes you feel exhausted and exhilarated at the same time. If ever the word 'masterpiece' was meant to be used, it was for this film.",9.0,thomashamps,2000/09/13,276,179
551,Moon,Moon,"It is a true marvel that Moon got made at all when it is so out of step with current film making trends and its all the more remarkable that it turned out to be an excellent film showcasing everything that can be good about low budget independent cinema and announces débutant director Duncan Jones as a real talent to watch in the future. The film stars Sam Rockwell as Sam Bell, the one man crew of a mining station on the dark side of the moon on a three year contract with only an endlessly cheery computer GERTY, voiced with brilliantly creepy calm by Kevin Spacey, for company. While the base is mainly automated Sam is required for maintenance and monitoring. His live communication link to Earth is down and he relies on video messages from his wife and child for comfort as he comes up to the end of the contract and the limits of his sanity. Whilst on a routine repair mission to one of the base's remote harvesters he suffers a bad accident and well, to reveal further would ruin the movie. Sam is one of Rockwell's best performances in a roller-coaster career, here he is able to constrain the 'zanier' aspects of his performances whilst still portraying someone on the ragged edge of their soul. His character wears the psychological scars of such extreme loneliness with such pitiable sadness that within minutes of the film's opening the audience has to question what kind of man would submit to these conditions, that reveal, when it comes, is a quite brilliant turn. Whilst praising Rockwell's performance I have to mention Spacey's voice acting that uses age old sci fi conventions about thinking computers to twist our expectations and encourages the audience to speculate ad constantly re-evaluate GERTY's motivations. GERTY'S design also evokes sci fi of old with his clunky panels and simple smiley face screen, a facet reflected in the base itself. A sparse and dirty environment, giving the impression of industrial space exploration, not the sleek lines and lens flares of the modern Star Trek but a vision of corporate exploitation. Everything about the base, from its single person crew to its basic food and living quarters and its clunky moon buggies reeks of a company spending as little money as possible for the biggest profit. The whole piece represents a throwback to the paranoia of the 1970's, sci fi's boom years, when space was seen as just another place ripe for exploitation by greedy corporations and authoritarian governments. When sci fi was created it was typically used as a means with which to examine humanity in extreme circumstances and the universality of the human experience. That has become lost lately, and notably this summer, as it becomes a tool for Hollywood to create ever larger explosions and ever shallower characters. This summer has already seen Wolverine, Star Trek, Terminator: Salvation and Transformers 2 assault the senses to varying degrees of success but with hardly a moment for the audience to catch their breath between them they epitomise the ultra high tempo of modern sci fi film-making. In that context Moon slow, thoughtful approach comes as a real shock to the system, here characters engage and discuss, they contemplate in silence as they try to comprehend the enormity of their discoveries and when the twists come they are slow reveals that the audience are trusted to understand without a flip chart and diagrams. Moon is one of those interesting, neat films that come along every so often to show what sci fi can still achieve and is destined for a long life on DVD. A thoroughly recommend sci fi slow burner on the nature of identity, find it, watch it, discuss it.",8.0,milofromtheblock,2009/07/27,9,5

Homer Hickham personal oversaw the construction of this film, so the ""based on a true story"" must hold it's own weight. Chris Cooper's performance in this film is just breathtaking. I don't think anyone could have played it better. The producers even said he was the only person they thought of for the role. But at first he turned it down! He said he didn't think the relationship between father and son was tough enough. He wanted to portray the character the way he remembered his own father. So in the end, they ended up rewriting some of the father/son scenes just so Mr. Cooper would accept the role. Brilliant family movie. Not just for kids.

555,October Sky,Powerful Coming Of Age Film!,"October Sky is one of the best coming-of-age films out there to watch. It has the theme of kids should do want they want to do, not what their parents decide for them. My favorite part of the movie is how the relationship between father and son was depicted. In most movies like this, the father is often depicted as the tyrant. But, while he is strict here, he is not as bad as most of these fathers. The film is boasted by lovable, relatable characters, a very strong screenplay, and great direction. Joe Johnston's film is about how four guys including Homer Hickam in a coal-mining town decide to create a rocket against the will of everyone in town besides their encouraging teacher. The acting is very good. Young Jake Gyllenhaal portrays Homer and he is a very good actor, much better than other child actors. Chris Cooper was really good as his father and I didn't hate him as much as I thought I would. Laura Dern is pretty good as the teacher, but I believe she over-acted just a little. Overall, this is a fantastic film for all ages to see. I'm sure this film could hit notes with the older generation who grew up in the 1950's. The movie inspires everybody that they can be who they want to be, and they must not let anyone get in their way. I rate this film 10/10.",10.0,g-bodyl,2013/07/11,1,1

557,Moon,"""Moon"" is a brilliantly psychological film driven by Sam Rockwell's utterly incredible performance","""I want to go home"" Duncan Jones' Moon is a magnificently beautiful character study and a dazzlingly complex and ambitious sci-fi film. Aside from some rather subtle similarities to other genre classics, the film rarely feels unoriginal, mostly due to the masterful storytelling and superb direction. The pace is never compromised by trite or useless scenes, but flows rather seamlessly from one harrowing moment to the next. Sam Bell is an astronaut miner stationed on the moon. He's nearing the end of his contract with Lunar Industries. A diligent employee for three arduous years, he has been made to remain separate from his family and all interaction with others. His home has been Selene, a moon base where he has spent his time. The only one he talks to is a computer named GERTY. Spent in complete isolation, he ponders his eventual return to earth and his family. Two weeks prior to his return, his communication with earth fails. After an accident occurs, Sam discovers something that forces him to doubt his own sanity and edge closer and closer to the breaking point. Duncan Jones and co-writer Nathan Parker are able to constantly keep things fresh and exciting throughout. Although slow at times, the deftly hypnotic pace allows the viewer to emotionally connect to such a degree that the film never becomes boring because of it. Sam Rockwell has been one of my favorite actors for a number of years and has been brilliant in quite a few films, and yet he manages to completely outdo himself here. His portrayal of his character is hauntingly emotional and layered to the point where every single scene he's in is perfectly compelling. His performance is absolutely riveting and is clearly one of the best performances in a film in recent memory. The cinematography is consistently breathtaking and wonderfully assists the direction. The score by Clint Mansell is another beautiful piece of this genuine work of art. Duncan Jones is an amazing director who has debuted with an incredibly thought-provoking, hauntingly complex film that deserves any number of awards it hopefully receives. It is truly an outstanding achievement that should be recognized for years to come as a genre-defining masterpiece.",10.0,PoeticProse22,2009/08/14,9,5

If you enjoy South Korean cinema, or just plain good cinema, I'm pretty sure you'll enjoy ""The Wailing."" It was directed by the same filmmaker who made ""The Chaser."" Part thriller, part horror movie, the story involves ghosts, possession, a strange illness, and lots of wailing. ;-) There's also some eccentric humour in it, but this is not a comedy film. I think it would make a good film for viewing during the Halloween season, because there are some creepy scenes in it. My only warning here: one scene involves animal sacrifice. So if you're a bit squeamish about stuff like that, you might want to fast forward through that sequence. But that scene isn't overly graphic and it doesn't last too long. Anyway, thumbs up from me. South Korea is pumping out a lot of great movies these days.",,mote99,2016/11/20,12,6
560,The Wailing,Not as good as I was meant to believe.,"This possession tale is told very differently and more mysteriously, which becomes increasingly disturbing as we learn more about what is actually happening here. The film was actually really creepy. There's also a lot of hidden agendas so one has to watch carefully and read between the lines. The ending will no doubt leave you a bit confused, as it appears there's been more than one demon all along (or at least an apprentice) but this is not made very clear. A second viewing might solve some of your unanswered questions. I must admit I found Do-won Kwak's acting almost lazy. Maybe this was the story's intention to have him look incompetent, but his character as a policeman was not very credible. The police in general seemed clueless and inexperienced and that was a bit of a drawback for me. When they found all the evidence at the Japanese man's home, they simply left and did not even attempt an arrest or brought him in for questioning. That was just not believable. They also too easily believed gossip instead of evidence, and the whole investigation back story was a lackluster effort, to say the least.

561,Ferris Bueller's Day Off,Never had a day off like this!,"Even today, I've wondered why this film is so loved by many people today. I guess it's because it was made during the decade that will never die, the 1980's. I've often felt that the reason people cherish the 80's is because the 1990's and the oughts of 2000 haven't got anything to distinguish them. Even in 2002 or 2003, we seem to be still stuck in the 1990's. Unless this decade has a style that will distinguish it, the 1980's will continue to be beloved. All the excesses of the 1980's are here. The story is pretty simple: Ferris Bueller (Mathew Broderick), a young man who seems to be in a class by himself, fakes an illness so he and his girlfriend Sloane Peterson (the cute Mia Sara) and best friend Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck) can traipse through Chicago. While he's out there, his ""enemies"" are out to ruin his afternoon. Jeffrey Jones is Ed Rooney, the Principal of his HS who is trying to bust Ferris for past truancy and is out to look for him. Jennifer Grey (who looked ancient in this film and was dating Broderick at the time) plays his older sister Jeanie, who wants to also ruin the day for him but ends up being the one with the bad day. Yes, the film has decent acting and is a somewhat fun romp, but the film was made to once again show everyone why the 80's was such a storied decade. The excesses are here: the big dance and song routine at the parade, Grey's outfit, the fact that Ferris' mother (Cindy Pickett) has a more hip hairstyle than her daughter, etc. You could never remake this one today, the 2000's haven't earned any distinct image yet. Not a favorite of mine, but I can understand those 80's lovers fawning over this. I guess I prefer to revere the 80's through video games like Grand Theft Auto:Vice City and Activision Anthology and the music (not the videos).",,BlackJack_B,2002/12/06,1,1
562,Crash,Disguised Hollywood Crap,"This movie is entertaining, if you want to relax on a Sunday afternoon and stop thinking about work and important stuff, watching this film would be a good option. However, it is a bad film, if you are looking for something truly interesting that you will remember in 10 years from now, don't even consider watching it. The acting is terrible, the plot is almost a joke, this film is an insult to the intellect because of the way the public is fooled into believing that ""this film is different"" but it actually isn't. What an overrated film. So many people liked it so much, I wonder what that says about our global society.",3.0,mltubio,2006/04/01,27,18
563,Intermission,"Has its moments, but should be better (**1/2)","A wild and frantic comedy/drama/thriller, set in Ireland, about the lives of several people whose lives interconnect in surprising and often funny ways. Sounds great, right? Well about 2/3 of it is. Events are set in motion when a small-time crook named John (Cillian Murphy, ""28 Days Later) breaks up with his girlfriend, Deirdre (Kelly Macdonald, ""Trainspotting"", ""Gosford Park""). She takes up with an older married man named Sam (Michael McEllhatton) who is later robbed by John and his friend Lehiff (a riveting and menacing Colin Farrel), who is being tailed by a cop (Colm Meaney), etc, etc, etc... All the stories bounce off each other and connect at surprising times, and the effect can be exhilarating and exciting. All the actors are very good as well, particularly Farrel and Shirley Henderson, in a touching and funny performance as Dierdre's cynical, bitter sister. Overall the film is pretty good, but when the story isn't really going anywhere, it drags and the chaos of it becomes a little grating. It's also difficult to understand what the actors are saying sometimes because of their thick Irish accent and slang. It's a pretty good film, though, the kind I might watch in the future if I'm channel-surfing and I come across it.",6.0,Ronin47,2004/06/08,13,6
564,The Wailing,Ghostly horror with strong performances,"Goksung (2016) Directed by Hong Jin-Na. I would be very surprised if this isn't the best South Korean movie this year. Director Jin Na takes the audience on an electrifying journey involving ghosts, spirits and the nature of evil itself. Like all great horror films, this one shows how fear builds up from ignorant rumors and gossip as the villagers of this backwater town start to lose their grip on reality. When incompetent police officer Jon-Goo is hired to investigate the multiple murders of man and a woman, he finds the killer covered in blood and shaking at the scene, as though in some kind of trance. He investigates further in his half-hearted way but becomes more and more absorbed. Trying to find a motive for such a senseless crime, he questions the locals. First, someone suggests that the murderer took mushrooms that cause hallucinations. When that idea is pushed aside, someone mentions how ever since a mysterious Japanese fishermen arrived some seriously strange things have been happening in the forest. Such as naked middle –aged men in nappies killing and eating deer in the forest. Then, there is a woman in white who starts appearing outside the police station late at night. It's only when his daughter starts speaking foul language and refuses to listen to him that he realizes he must do everything he can to rid the village of the evil. The corruption of innocence is a horror film tradition dating back to The Exorcist (1972). Director Hong Jin-Na could have watched that film in preparation. Then again, he mostly avoids sudden shocks and prefers to maintain an atmosphere of mounting dread. Originally titled Goksung, which has the dual meaning both of the place, and the sound to wail (which is where the English title comes from). By the time Hwang Jun-Min appears as Shaman to exorcise the presence from the village, we have been led into such a frenzy that we feel we may never recover. After some fairly lacklustre recent films which never delivered their potential (Tunnel, Train to Busan), this film really goes the distance. Fans of Korean films will notice the key stylistic features of Korean films, from cheap barbecue joints where depressed characters down their sorrows in soju; to families all sharing a one-floor apartment and sleeping on the floor. Also present in Korean films are prolonged scenes of characters pouring out their grief by hospital bedsides. There's a great one here where the wife of a man struck by lightning in the forest remarks that hewould have died if he had taken so many tonics. The landscape is in many ways as important as the human characters, and the frequent pull-outs to the misty mountains suggest that such ghosts and spirits have been around since the beginning of time. The film is subtitled, with yellow lettering to indicate Japanese dialogue.",8.0,mrrcott,2016/10/13,13,4
565,Hotel Transylvania,Typical of today's generation,"Hotel Transylvania was probably one of the worst animated movies I've ever seen. The plot is alright: Dracula runs a motel for monsters, but a human tourist falls in love with his goth daughter Mavis. The voice acting was terrible though. Adam Sandler? Selena Gomez? Come on, what has society come to? Ever since Twilight came out Gothic movies like these have been popping up to appeal to younger audiences (Monster High, Frankenweenie, etc.) and I'm sure I'll get some unhelpful review votes for this, but the fact that people like this movie is the scariest thing about it. The movie itself is pathetic; bad soundtrack, awful voice actors, typical and predictable story, and to make matters worse there'll be a sequel coming out in 2015! I have now lost all hope in humanity. I was hoping that Hotel Transylvania might be different from the stupid remakes that won't stop coming out, but no, it was just a fast way to make money off child viewers. Movies today are about money, not quality. It's sad, but I doubt things will ever change.",4.0,TheBlueHairedLawyer,2014/10/11,6,4
566,Crash,"Wildy over-rated, contrived, lots of noise","There were a few exciting, tense vignettes between the characters of ""Crash"" but there were also some tendentious, heavy, hackneyed things that really stood out: Don Cheadle's voice-over, ostensibly deep (the voice of conscience in the film), Sandra Bullock's hugging her maid towards the end of the film and confessing to her that she (the maid) was actually her best friend, the really quite sappy Latino whose gets killed when trying to save her father (the ""red-cloak"" piece of malarkey), the condescending treatment of Asians (especially the atrociously accented Korean woman at the beginning), the long sequence involving Brendan Fraser in the courtroom (it didn't seem relevant and was slow, the Terrence Howard/Thandie Newton confrontation (a lot of sparks but not really that compelling except for the melodrama), and so on. That the Matt Dillon turns to the Ryan Phillipe character when they break-up as a police team, ""You think you know who you are but you don't have any idea, et. al."" is gratuitous. Like so many lines in this film, it comes out of nowhere. Not subtle, not a work of art, but plenty of adrenaline and action around a hot-button issue. Which is probably why less sophisticated, younger movie-goers (I just can hear them saying ""Really cool, man, it'so SO-O deep"") seem to have gone for this film. Most critics apart from Ebert and a few others were very lukewarm, if not downright very critical about this film. Believe me, it doesn't hold a candle and is definitely not in the same category as ""La Strada,"" ""Gosford Park,""...or last year's exceptional ""Brokeback Mountain."" Three much better films with superior screenplays/plot-lines, and character development are ""L.A. Confidential,"" ""Mullholland Drive,"" and ""Chinatown."" Dialogue clichés, lots of high-speed car chases, clichéd-characters, lots of movie-stars doing uncharacteristically small turns, and Hollywood's favorite liberal subject matter (racism) are a recipe for Hollywood acclaim and middlebrow American audience approval. This film made only about 33% of its receipts from outside the U.S., a pretty weak showing. ""Brokeback Mountain""'s receipts overseas accounted for more than its domestic grosses. That it won the Oscar is NOT that surprising when such middling fare as ""Beautiful Mind"" (pure schlock except for Russell Crowe's acting). ""Gladiator,"" ""Braveheart,"" etc. won. (This is definitely the last time I'll even pay attention to the Oscars). At ""Crash"" at least breaks the stereotype that all African-Americans are an unfairly persecuted, noble minority.",2.0,denny1700,2006/10/25,29,19
567,The Wailing,The Groaning,"10-word review: Vastly overappreciated pseudo-horror film with little continuity or technical accomplishment. Long review: The only wailing you'll remember after watching this film is your own cry of irritation having just spent 2 hours and 36 mins following a trek-to-nowhere that could have been edited down to a mere short. It's a common exaggeration to say that a movie has no plot, but in this case it's hard to argue. (Spoiler alert) A small South Korean hamlet is invaded by demons (who double as Minolta film camera enthusiasts -- where do they develop their rolls?) undertaking a wanton campaign to slaughter the villagers one by one. Who are these photographic fiends? Why do they ""shoot to kill""? By what supernatural means do they convert the innocent into bloodthirsty monsters? Such basic questions never disturb the imagination of our filmmaker. Instead, the bulk of the movie concerns the villagers' unreasonable reactions to their increasingly troubling plight: e.g. (1) The police find a wall of photos of the mounting victims in the home of the suspected murderer/demon, yet do nothing when the suspect walks in. (2) Zombies attack the innocent only for their friends to defend the zombies instead. (3) Doctors conclude that mushrooms consumed locally for many years are suddenly at fault for patients molting their skin, losing all higher brain function, and biting anything that moves. Alrighty then. After hours of confusion, the question boils down to whether the devil is an aged Japanese man who lives in the nearby forest. Why this should be the denouement of such an overlong odyssey is anyone's guess, but it's a clear reference to the generalized sentiment that Japanese = devils, probably the most overused and least surprising conceit in all of Korean cinematic history. Best to stick with the tried and true, I guess. Technically, the film is a slop-fest with minimal evidence of editing. I would definitely have resorted to fast-forwarding had I been watching it alone; many scenes were the cinematic equivalent of enduring a simpleton windbag use tortuous explanations for the most insignificant conclusions. In one humorous example of the filmmakers' inattention, the protagonist struggles with a decision to accept or decline a phone call, eventually deciding to decline the call BY PRESSING THE GREEN BUTTON. This sort of inadvertent surrealism sums up the movie for me. So why the decent reviews on this site? That's hard to answer. It seems that a certain number of reviewers are just big Korean film fans, and maybe this attachment impedes their judgment. That said, I'm a Korean film fan myself. If you're interested in an infinitely better Korean horror/crime movie, I'd recommend ""Memories of Murder,"" Bong Joon Ho's tour de force dramatization of the Hwaseong serial murders. Now that's a scary film you won't want to forget.",3.0,shea765,2017/06/20,65,35
568,Crash,A letdown (spoilers),"I wasn't the least bit impressed by Crash. It's a film that tackles an important subject (racism) but it's a film that tackles it with two-dimensional characters, contrivances and sentimentality. In the end all it says is that we're all prejudiced in our own way and that prejudice is bad. Well, to anyone with half a brain that's hardly a revelation, but although the message is a little obvious and pap, I would be happy to embrace the film if it were well written and well directed, but it's not. What disappointed me most about the film was the way the characters weren't characters but mouthpieces instead. It's like Paul Haggis has culled every different opinion and view on race and shoehorned it into his film. At no point does it feel organic. At no point do the people seem like people expressing themselves freely. They always sound like they're reading a magazine article, that someone is putting words in their mouth. Of course this is the case, but good film writing is when you completely forget there's a script. The worst culprits are the two black carjackers. All they do is discuss the prejudices they face. Sure this may be a subject close to their hearts, but I find it hard to accept that they wouldn't talk about anything else. And yes you may scream that that is what the film is about; prejudice, but I've always thought it much more effective to tackle subjects through themes, rather than have the characters rant about the issue at hand for a couple of hours like they were on Question Time. But then again, subtlety isn't a thing this film is endowed with. Having said that, though, I do admire the film for at least having a go at tackling racism in an even-handed way. It's a film that acknowledges that racism isn't the sole preserve of whites, that do-gooders do as much harm as bigots and that we're all partly to blame for the current mess. But although these things are touched upon, none of them is investigated in any depth. The film takes a scattershot approach to its subject, rendering it unsatisfactory. The most interesting segment is the one to do with Don Cheadle's investigation into a shooting involving two policemen. It touches on political spin, the way that shortsighted idiots want to promote people not for their individual merits but for their political value, and the way that pussyfooting around on the issue of race has a negative effect on everyone. But while I think this would make a very interesting film all on it's own, and one that would make more profound comments on race, it's just a brief portion of the film. Conversely you have a pretty poor segment focusing on an Iranian shopkeeper. The man is like Basil Fawlty without the laughs. He's a complete knob who spends his time ranting and raving and behaving obnoxiously. And he even gets so irate that he tries to kill a Hispanic man who he thinks cheated him (the Hispanic man is the complete opposite of the shopkeeper  he's so saintly it defies belief). But this leads to a syrupy scene where the Hispanic man's daughter intervenes (bathed in ethereal light and accompanied by twinkly music) and inadvertently allows the shopkeeper to rethink his worldview. And that's another thing that's wrong with the film. All the prejudiced characters in the film have their beliefs adjusted through tumultuous events. I know the film's called Crash and Cheadle at the start says that people are disconnected and only change their views when they collide with other people, but it's not really true. Yeah a traumatic event can change your outlook on life but people's prejudices are more often eroded through time and experience. So while I can accept people changing their views when they crash into other people, it just seems silly when it occurs multiple times like it does in this film. And the way it happens, too, doesn't help. I've already mentioned the scene with the shopkeeper, but the scene where Bullock embraces her Mexican housekeeper and says that she's her best friend is about as subtle as Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier linking fingers in The Defiant Ones and Paul McCartney and Stevie Wonder singing 'Ebony and Ivory'. And then there's the final scene itself. The sassy black car thief frees some Thai people. Wonderful you may think. He's discovered his humanity. But aside from the fact that the scene is saccharine in the extreme, it also makes no sense logically. He frees a bunch of people who can't speak English and who have no money (oh, he gives them $40). They're going to have a good time, aren't they? They can look forward to living on the streets, being spit upon by people in SUVs and, if they're lucky, they might get a job washing dishes. It's the American dream, baby. But then to make the ending even worse, right at the final moment, there's another crash and more racial anger. You see what's the director is saying? The cycle continues. Wow, it's a revelation! But the thing that infuriated me the most was the idiotic scene where Phillippee shoots Cheadle's brother in his car. It was ridiculous. Philippee picks the bloke up, they behave like children and wind each other up, and then in a tragic mix-up, Cheadle's brother gets killed. The scene is one big contrivance. The director needs a sting in the tail, to again prove that the cycle continues, so you have a big coincidence, an unbelievable argument and a shooting. Yes the races are still uneasy together, yes they're still suspicious and yes the consequences can sometimes be tragic, but by trying to cover all the bases and all the arguments, Haggis spreads himself far too thin. Better to do one thing well than lots of things poorly.",,Ricky_Roma__,2006/01/10,45,28
569,Hotel Transylvania,BLEH BLEH BLEH! Thats what I have to say to this movie.,"Somehow, Hotel Transylvania feels unfinished. This film is suppose to homage the classic Universial Horror Movie Monsters. But ends up being your typical 2000's and 2010's clichéd kids fest about having fun and stuff. So, one of Adam Sandler's films foreshadowed him to play Dracula in a movie. Well, here he is playing Dracula who lives in 1895 (Not Bad Impersonator) as he has a daughter who he must protect because of the big bad humans. The monsters build a hotel/resort to protect her and the monsters from the Humans. About 110 years later, his daughter Mavis (I think thats the wrong name of the daughter of Dracula. I think its suppose to be Mary Or Whatever) played by Selena Gomez always has wanted to go out in the world and explore. She is turning 118 years old (I think 18 years old in Vampire Years I guess) and her farther lets her out for like a few minutes but tricks her into thinking humans are evil by building this town and having zombies play humans. Anyways, this one human named Johnny played by The Lonely Island's Andy Samberg finds a way through and Dracula dresses him up like a monster and pretends he is the party planner. But uh oh! Johnny and Mavis are getting a close relationship together! Trying to get him out of the place fails obviously and the ""Chaos"" he creates still goes on. The animation is 50/50 on this picture. For The Positives, each Character has his/her own unique design. Frankenstien's Monster is blue instead of the regular Green and he wears a Hawaiian shirt. For The Negatives... Ill get to that right now. I feel that there is too much stuff on screen for me to sink in. Yeah it looks good but it doesn't mean that I will care if a room is highly detailed. The characters are sometimes amusing but not really funny. In one ""Joke"" Frankenstien's Monster's body comes in half and sneaks up behind the Mummy (Ceelo Green) and farts behind him. Oh. Yeah. Very Funny. VERY FUNNY. Characters I feel don't emote enough. For Example, if there are 6-8 characters on screen and two are talking, and the other 4-6 are just standing there, they will have the same dumb expression on their face for the rest of the scene. Also, if you are beginning to watch Monster Movies, don't start with this one. Go watch Horror Of Dracula or Bride Of Frankenstien first. Because if you watch this first, you don't know anything about the characters as they don't explain their traits. Why should we care about characters we don't know anything about? The actors (Most of them) are Adam Sandler's friends. David Spade and Kevin James are examples. There is one plot hole that I must point out. The Invisible Man is well, invisible for most of the movie but he wears glasses so we can see him. In one scene, he wears shorts and then someone pulls them down and he is embarrassed. So was he naked all this time? Does he wear invisible clothes? If so, why is he wearing Visible clothes? Running gags are unfunny as its like Oh Dracula Gets Mad and Oh Johnny is having fun. The Ending isn't Even an Ending. Its just a stupid music video with lyrics that don't make no sense. Its just ZING ZING ZING and whatever the lyrics are. I liked it the first time I watched it which was a few months ago, but now I don't like it anymore. The acting is alright, the animation is OK, but the movie fails to do anything neat with these monsters in the situations they get into. But there is one scene that I liked. Maybe two. The Wolfman (Steve Buscemi) eats a bunch of sheep that is in the road and one scene where There is this Female dressed as a mummy walking by and The Mummy is has the I WANT face. Thats basically it. I don't want to overwrite to 1,100 words so Ill just leave at this. Hotel Transylvania is a unfinished movie with no ending, plot holes and characters we don't care about. 49/100 C-",4.0,michaelhirakida,2013/11/18,29,17
570,October Sky,Movie that can get inside your emotions before you know it,"I had the pleasure of working in this part of WV a few years ago. The values and the personalities depicted still exist 50 years after the period the story is set in. The story line is one that I saw play out on a daily basis making the movie very true to life. The interactions and relationships between Homer, his parents and friends struck a chord in me. I never noticed this when it came out. It caught my attention while staying in a hotel and Showtime has it on heavy rotation. Hearing Welch, War and Bluefield caught my attention from having lived in the area for two years. The area is beautiful to travel thru, if you avoid the coal trucks. Some of the towns don't look like they have changed since Roosevelt was president. Having been there and knowing people who live there today brings the movie to life for me.

572,Death of a Salesman,Well Done TV Adaptation Of Arthur Miller's Famous Play,"Like many people, I suspect that my first exposure to Arthur Miller's great play ""Death Of A Salesman"" was studying it in high school English class. It's a great story of a sad life - the ageing travelling salesman Willy Loman having big dreams to the point at which he's not entirely in touch with reality, perhaps going a bit senile, failing at his job, dealing with sons who haven't accomplished much either and a wife who tries against all odds to hold everything together, and becoming increasingly desperate as time goes on. Dustin Hoffman played the part of Willy Loman to perfection. The anger; the sadness; the frustration and desperation - it was all there and all very real. The supporting cast more than held their own, including John Malkovich as son Biff, who - as he himself finally admits - is little more than a bum and a thief, Stephen Lang as womanizing and under- achieving second son Happy and Kate Reid as long-suffering wife Linda. Translating a stage play to television isn't always easy, but this one was very well done. Anyone who's a fan of Miller's play would take any opportunity to watch this.

573,Goodfellas,"""He shoots him in the foot, he tells him to go f**k himself.""","One of the best and funniest lines in an excellent movie. Goodfellas is, in my opinion, one of the best movies Scorsese's ever made. It has such great momentum, both dramatically and visually. Ballhaus and Schoonmaker are really at the top of their game in this movie. Fantastic. But it's all in the story. If you don't have it on paper, it doesn't matter how many cool camera angles or transitions you can come up with. The movie runs for almost two and a half hours, yet it never gets boring. It always manages to get, and keep, you interested. The script is perfect. I normally have sort of a problem with voice overs. As Brian Cox says in Adaptation: ""God help you if you use voice-over in your work, my friends. God help you. That's flaccid, sloppy writing. Any idiot can write a voice-over narration to explain the thoughts of a character."" But here it works wonders, it helps to propel the story along with the excellent soundtrack. And the characters... The names alone... Jimmy Two Times, Johnny Roastbeef, Joe Buddha... Why don't we see people like Frank Cicero and Frank Vincent in more movies? Not to mention Ray Liotta. I don't get why he isn't hired more often. Regardless how bad the movie is, he usually is able to make something interesting and/or funny out of his character. Take ""Copland"" or ""Hannibal"" or ""Heartbreakers"" or ""Blow"" or why not ""Narc""? Well, as always, there are exceptions. I wouldn't see ""Operation Dumbo Drop"" or ""Escape from Absolom"" again, even if my life depended on it... Joe Pesci is... ...well, he's Joe Pesci in this movie. But I gotta hand it to him, no one can pull off a Joe Pesci like he can! He IS funny like a clown, and he DOES amuse me! Robert De Niro's perfect as the laid back gangster Jimmy Conway who just explodes with fits of rage. As I said, one of Scorsese's best. He's one of my all-time favourite directors, but I just wish he'd stop making cr*p like Gangs of New York. The Special Edition of Goodfellas is coming out on DVD in Europe this fall, and I'll be waiting first in line to replace my old version. I'd recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a movie with both a compelling story as well as great characters. Although I have to leave a little caveat, It IS violent.",10.0,shanayneigh,2004/07/24,15,9
574,Crash,"a realistic, gritty, no-nonsense look at the way life is for so many....","After seeing this movie, I was able to really understand what ""Six Degrees of Separation"" means. There is a thread that weaves its way through the landscape of life connecting, influencing, and defining all. This movie is certainly thought-provoking, one cannot watch it without feeling either privileged to have become part of the fabric, or like a fly on the wall - seeing, yet unable to influence or guide. There is almost a sense of frustration at ones inability to be no more than an observer in this movie since it compels you to want to shout in warning, gasp in shock, cry in sorrow, and hold in comfort. ""Crash"" is definitely not a movie to use as a venue to escape life for a couple of hours, but it is a movie that certainly makes you take a second and third look at who you are within yourself. The actors are surprising not only for their depth of performance, but also because they do not play characters you think you know. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes drama, action, comedic relief, or just an appreciation for a well-thought out movie.",9.0,acclar,2005/04/23,713,398
575,Primal Fear,The TWISTS are actually PLOT HOLES,"First of all, I accept that the acting was very good from both Richard Gere who could have been more arrogant but anyway he was a sweet guy inside in this movie and also Edward Norton who made a very good acting with his split personalities. But now let's focus on the movie how it was written. We have a boy who may be convicted with murder and everything points that he was the murderer. His courageous and famous lawyer want's to save him because he thinks that the boy didn't kill anyone. The only thing left is mental illness so a shrink is there to diagnose him. The shrink discovers his problem ""split personalities"". IF THIS IS TRUE THAN THE BOY DOESN'T END UP IN JAIL BUT IN A MENTAL INSTITUTE , JUST GET A COUPLE OF OTHER DOCTORS TO PROVE THIS AND CASE CLOSED. Here is our plot hole together with the twist : twist- split personalities (good twist but raises questions afterwards) plot hole - can't prove the split personalities (not true because all the lawyer should do is ask the judge and a couple of doctors can come and give a final decision about the kid ) Instead of asking other doctors Veil thinks he should prove that in the courtroom like it a show of some kind. Here we are in the courtroom the kid is being asked by the prosecution lawyer where he gets up punches his own lawyer and threaten that he will break the prosecution lawyers neck. Now everybody is convinced because of that little show that the kid is actually sick NO REAL PROOF NO DOCTORS. In the final scene the kid appears to be normal and everything was a show for him to escape the punishment. So this is the second twist and plot hole : twist - no split personalities hole - no doctor actually proved anything of this kind being or not being split personalities, and the jury doesn't need any more evidence because they are all doctors and they know what they are doing. So in conclusion this movie tries to be smart but it falls in it's own thinking. Actors are really good but they look bad from the writers. I understood who was the murder in the moment where the boy talked about his mental illness or when he gave that hateful look to the shrink. At that moment I started hating the movie not because I knew that but because of the twist that were major plot holes that made those good actors look stupid.",5.0,elioolei222,2013/02/18,7,5
576,Moon,"Quiet, meditative, yet plausible scenario","A film exploring the dynamics of hope, faith, morality, and greed. Above-average script-writing, a refreshing lack of overdone clichÃ©s, decent leisurely pacing that didn't rush the film and excellent acting put this heads and shoulders above other films from the get-go. I liked this movie more than I expected I would. The theater I watched it at was almost full so it seems good word of mouth has gotten around about this film. I liked the space base setting other recent sci-fi films have shiny surfaces that are mechanistic with impossibly perfect technology, I liked the almost retro chunky technology feel of the set it really humanized it. I loved Gerty's simple low-tech emoticons, it added to the film. The two Sam's interacting with each other was compassionate and almost brother-like especially when the ""older"" Sam teaches the new Sam to carve. Surreal moments like where the two Sam's play Ping-Pong helped lighten the mood. I loved the ending with the media as I cheered for the Sam that made it. Slight Biblical references with names like Eve, and the mining machines are named Matthew, Judas etc. but this is a Western movie so it is to be expected.

Right along side with Casino, an intriguing story and characters ruined by an incompetent Martin Scorsese. The story revolves around a man (Robert DeNiro) who takes a job as a taxi driver, and wants to get his life organized, finally does so when he meets a teen prostitute (Jodie Foster), and wants to help her regain her life. Robert DeNiro's performance and character he plays is definitely inspirational, along with his line ""You talking to me?"", which this movie is credited for starting. But even great stories with great actors can still fail miserably due to lousy presentation cause of a flimsy director, namely Martin Scorsese. He ruined Taxi Driver by making it dull, lame and impotent, as he did with his other films. Out of all the directors, like John Carpenter and George Lucas, they normally ruin masterpieces the second time around with remakes, special editions, and prequels/sequels. Scorsese wrecks masterpieces the first time around. The story alone is enough to warrant the movie a 7/10, but the awful directing renders Taxi Driver to 2.5/10. If directed by anyone except Martin Scorsese, then Taxi Driver had a better chance of winning best picture. But with Scorsese, Taxi Driver is thankful that the Razzies didn't appear until the early 1980's. But the character study and story are too much to ignore, and demands a remake without a movie wrecker like Martin Scorsese.",3.0,NewDivide1701,2006/06/28,36,16
578,The Wailing,"Long, uneven, but good","An incompetent cop is terrified when mass hysteria hits his community, leaving a trail of corpses and demented victims, but he must man up as the evil force that drives the slaughter extends its reach to his daughter. Long run time that puts down many layers, but without total coherence. The first act is interesting, because you get a police procedural played for laughs but with a real sense of rural superstition and prejudice. My favourite scene was the girl throwing the stones - it introduces an odd character in a memorable way, and also does a funny time-passing gag as the stones build up around the hero's feet. The second act packs in a lot, especially the impressive dance exorcism, and the third act starts with a good zombie fight and does a skillful job of keeping the audience guessing. Problem is some scenes are clunky, where you keep wishing they'd get there already or do the obvious thing or just stop repeating questions. And what were they thinking with the translator scene? Tiresome. In the end I wasn't sure the story had created its own world. The acting is good. Early on the lead was sometimes annoying. But the standout was the daughter - huge charisma when she was happy, chilling when she was possessed. Pace was a bit uneven in the first half, but nice and tight as the climax approached. Editing not too imaginative, and there was no standout image, but the director did well to keep the story moving when it could have collapsed into confusion. Music was excellent in the exorcism scene, but otherwise mostly orchestral mood stuff. Overall: Big ship that shaves a few icebergs but makes it to port. 7/10, although it should be worth a rewatch so I may mark it up. ps. Animal lovers beware - some unpleasant scenes, particularly one with some crows and a dog.",7.0,begob,2016/07/11,18,5
579,Pulp Fiction,"A good movie, but not a great movie","Pulp Fiction is a good, well-acted movie that is way, way, way over hyped by its fans. The core of the movie, the blathering of Vincent and Jules is fun and enjoyable. Bruce Willis as a hot-headed boxer does an excellent job communicating his fear and desperation. In the end, the movie's quirks and twists are merely to make a rather run-of-the-mill arthouse film seem more edgy. There is no question that this is a well made and fun movie. However it is not the amazing Second Coming of Christ as many Tarantinophiles would have us all believing. Many of the components are merely there to make us, the audience, gasp in horror or gaze in amazement. Do we REALLY need to watch John Travolta stick a needle in Uma Thurmond? Yeah, sure it was cool at the time but that coolness quickly wears off when you realize there is really nothing likeable about any of these people.",7.0,aplato,2000/11/06,101,52
580,The Chorus,The best movie of 2004,"This is funny how people get from one extreme to another about this movie. When I saw the movie it was in a Citadelle in an open air cinema by the French Riviera (Villefranche sur Mer, very very nice). The friend I went to see it with said to me: ""I give you the tissues now because I predict you will cry like a baby"". And I cried like a baby. The story made me think about Sister Act ONLY IN THE STORY!!! A failed musician converting a group of difficult children into a choir... But this version of the story is way above the American one. Gérard Jugnot is really great. I like him very much since he has abandoned his comic roles. I loved him in Le meilleur Espoir Feminin and Monsieur Batignole. I think he's an great actor as he can convey a lot of emotions, from laughter to sincere emotion. At last, the fact that all the children are not professional actors adds to the sincerity of the film which should won at least an Academy Award this year if the Americans still can be sensitive about sincerity...",10.0,thespira,2005/02/02,81,61

When things go wrong, the doctors built in appendages which helps him in his experiments somehow give him the ability to create more havoc as his revenge runs rampant after the death of his beloved wife. Wanting to still create his experiments, doctor octopus begins his reign of terror across the city as Spiderman tries to quell his vindictive nature.

Does anyone ever wonder why Scorsese has never won an Oscar? It's because the movies he makes are terrible. End of story. In this train-wreck of a film, Scorsese has the actors bumble across the screen for 2 and a half hours muttering in God-awful ""Italian"" accents. Scorsese probably thought he could capture the brilliance of the Godfather trilogy when he made this film. To say the least, he failed miserably. I pity those who consider Goodfellas a classic.

583,The Green Mile,"If this is Christian allegory, I'll eat my mitre","Everyone remember the story about Christ and the public stoning? Well, to the extent that ""The Green Mile"" is Christian allegory, Christ said something like this: `Let he who is without sin cast the first stone. -Oh wait, I'M without sin!"" THUNK! Why does everyone assume that this story even takes place in a Christian universe? Is it because so many of the characters are Christian? But this is 1930s American South. What did you expect? When a character with supernatural powers of healing lumbers up, OF COURSE everyone assumes the powers are God-given; they assume his perfectly ordinary eyebrows are God-given, too; but the script gives us no reason to suppose that they're right. Rather the reverse. There's something random and essentially pointless about Coffey's abilities and actions, something that suits an atheist or pagan universe in which all sorts of oddities just turn up, something which doesn't justify the atmosphere of reverential ponderousness adopted by Frank Darabont and his cast. (What IS that brown dust that Coffey spews out periodically? Is it now OBLIGATORY for directors to run the rough footage through a computer and make it worse somehow?) But it's a very modern sort of paganism. There's nothing at all beautiful about the magic, which is a telling flaw. Look: it's not as bad as I thought it would be. I THOUGHT that Darabont would have let the extravagant praise heaped upon ""The Shawshank Redemption"" (a good film, by the way) go to his head, and produce a slow, lingering, pompous version of a less interesting story. Sort of true, but it has its moments (although, as more than one critic I've read has added, ""perhaps by chance""). I thought Tom Hanks would be unendurable. Surprisingly, he does a good job, all things considered. I thought the racism would get on my nerves. It's not really racist. Coffey is a simpleton, but not because of the rule that blacks must be simpletons; rather, the rule is that good people must be simpletons. (Coffey is so good he can barely form sentences.) I thought that the bookends would waste my time and weaken the film's structure. They do. Objectively speaking, a bad film; but, although my interest waxed and waned, it was easy to stay involved through to the end.",6.0,Spleen,2000/06/22,10,5

I never stopped smiling the entire time the disc was in the player, and that includes the special features. I did not watch all of the special features, but if I ever buy this movie, I'll be sure to do that. This movie is so corny, but it's ever so funny. Jennifer A. gives the perfect performance for her character, that I would've never expected. Hands down, an upper if you're feeling down. And the only spoiler is that they are probably gonna make more of these movies, as Charlie Day, and I think one other actor hinted at in the special features.

586,The Green Mile,"Wonderful, Moving to Tears...","I love this movie, and I have seen it a couple times. It doesn't matter that I know what is going to happen or that I know the movie like the back of my hand, I cry endlessly every single time. I watched it again last night. My boyfriend and I bought it, and he had never seen it. So we sat down to watch the movie, and I realized how truly emotionally moving this movie is. IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE ENTIRETY OF THE MOVIE DO NOT READ ANY FURTHER DOWN... The characters in this movie really hit home. You fall in love with these men that are on death row..(all except for ""Wild Bill""). You don't know what on earth they have done, yet it is so bad that they are on death row, and you fall in love with them. You can't help it. I sat there last night, propped up on my pillow in the bed and watched and fell in love with this huge beast of a man that is convicted of raping and murdering two girls. (I knew from the get-go that he didn't do it). And I watched and fell in love with Dale, a French, homosexual, crazy, mouse-loving man. I watched him fall in love with Mr. Jingles. I grew into this hate for Percy ""WET""more (I still get a kick out of that name). And when it came time for Dale to be executed, I cried like I was losing a family member. It was so hard to watch this happen! My boyfriend had to pause the movie, just to check on me. I sat there for five minutes, crying so hard. Then the same thing for John Coffey, I couldn't even watch him be persecuted. I sat beside my boyfriend, face buried in his chest weeping every tear out of me. It was so awful. I have NEVER in my life had a movie effect me like the way this one does. It is a brilliant movie, and the characters chosen for each role could not have been better portrayed if this was a true story, with the real-life people playing their own parts. Tom Hanks is a wonderful actor, and personally I think he does his best when he is acting as a southern authority figure. He is such a convincing actor, along with everyone else in this movie. Props to the actors, director, and Stephen King, you all are wonderful!",,AnglsBbgrl,2002/12/12,7,4
587,Pulp Fiction,this is a fantastic film,"Quentin Tarantino demonstrated to the world the powerful ingenuity he possesses, and of which he boasts in every minute of this one, his best film, of 2 and a half hours of duration. The real magic of the film is that its viewing is short and leaves you wanting even more, despite its length. Another particularly attractive aspect is its black humour and ordinary situations. Everything is incredible in Pulp Fiction, but without a doubt the most charismatic thing of all is its script, dividing the facts into chapters that were later imitated in other films by other directors and repeated with other films such as ""Kill Bill"". These chapters are not even exposed in a chronological order, which forces the viewer to fit the pieces of the plot, which would be difficult to describe. The next strong point is the very famous cast with brilliant performances that raise the quality of the film to unattainable levels. In particular I want to express my admiration for John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson in their roles as thugs/collectors (Vincent Vega and Jules, respectively) with unforgettable dialogues and discussions that are present almost at all times in their joint performance. Another ingredient magnificently introduced is his soundtrack, with great themes, besides the mythical title song, including pop, rock and soul themes (I find especially elegant Travolta's dance song with Uma Thurman, by Chuck Berry). In short, I can only say that I find no fault with this film and that I do not bring anything new that anyone already knows about this work. Unless Tarantino does something of this magnitude again, this is one of my favorite movies of all time 10/10",10.0,flopezgraziano,2020/07/26,2,2

589,Blackfish,Gut-wrenching.,"This year is already shaping up to be a great one for documentaries and Blackfish is quickly earning the reputation of being the most essential. And it absolutely deserves it. Although its an emotionally charged argument, there's a rational logic behind it. Every time there's found footage of killer whale incidents it's utterly gut-wrenching and you can't help but dread the moments that inevitably shook the world when they could've been prevented. Fortunately, the filmmakers find a different way to present the footage each time and it keeps it from feeling repetitive and builds to feeling more heart breaking at every turn. In its use of talking head interviews with former trainers, it ends up genuinely dramatic without feeling melodramatic as many documentaries can. It oozes with passion for the creatures which helps enforce its argument against their treatment, not just for better protection for trainers, but for corporations like SeaWorld to not turn a blind eye at the clear injustice they've cased. What's the moral cost of the business and entertainment? I certainly won't ever be able to be entertained by animal acts without thinking about Blackfish. Thisis an extremely powerful documentary that's brilliantly structured, tragic and cinematic. More than worth your time. 8/10",8.0,Sergeant_Tibbs,2013/09/18,66,58

Sometimes it is sometimes it's not. Clockwork orange is one of those which i felt was garbage as a movie. Pulp fiction is another. Sure, it has speed, weird characters and slick lines and stories all over the place. For me weird isn't always good as there is no red line, no real story to follow. I don't even find this movie very cool even though it might be worth a watch just cause it's like no other movie. But the story, the substance of the movie is very thin. Tarantino is for me not a very good director. Sure, some of his movies are OK, but mostly he overdo it on many occasions, which makes it hard to takes them seriously. It's no real drama, no action, no thriller, just something put in a blender it seems.

592,Crash,overrated piece of trash,"I do not want to do an in-depth analysis of this film. Rather, I'll point out what I consider makes it a very poor effort: the script. The same guy who did the script for CRASH also did the script for MILLION DOLLAR BABY. Both won the Oscar for best picture. I must be pretty out of touch to criticize this guy, but here goes. The main problem is that every character is ""invented"". That is, each character is so obviously the product of a fertile (and I am using that word kindly) imagination. In CRASH the politician and his wife are absolute stereotypes. They speak the most inane lines, like from a comic book or low-grade soap opera. The two cops are similarly contrived. One is a good guy and one is a bad guy. One is an idealist. One is a cynical veteran. I imagine such categories of cops do exist, but to give them life it takes someone who knows the genres, like Joseph Wambaugh. (In fact, to see how really bad CRASH is, just compare it to THE ONION FIELD). We also have the two foul-mouthed gang-banging black youth, hell bent on insanity. Big deal. Anyone can produce such characters. There is the misunderstood, good-guy Mexican plumber, who just happens to love his young daughter oh so much. Etc. Etc. Each character has the depth of a comic-book creation. They all speak in litanies of clichés. The plot too is just a clever manage of intersections. It is so obviously the product of the next cup of coffee or cigarette. It is cleverness without depth or substance. Christ, that this film won best picture just begs belief. While I am getting in my two cents here, MILLION DOLLAR BABY is the same cliché-riddled mess. It is obvious that the guy who wrote knew nothing about boxing. The characters are pathetic, lifeless creations. What has Hollywood come to that such movies walk away with top prize?",,chris_boys,2006/04/20,80,45

The story follows a teen through his experiments in rocket building, and the hardships his working class town imposes on him while he tries to expand his mind to follow his calling to science and engineering. Being a scientist who broke out of a working class town myself, I instantly related to this movie.

But, whatever you do, don't quit.

I wouldn't necessarily call it a good movie, but it's not bad either. I was impressed by the way director John Crowley was able to maintain a somewhat coherent storyline despite having so many interwoven characters. The problem with most ensemble pieces is that the characters tend to get lost in the mix. I was intrigued by the way Crowley was able to develop each character enough to make them interesting, even though I think he could have sacrificed a couple of the more minor characters to make some of the others richer. I thought the acting was very good, which is typical of European films, but be warned that you might want to use the subtitle option (unless you're Irish) because the Irish accents are so sharp, especially Colin Farrell, that it's often hard to understand what's being said. The fabric of the film itself involves many characters involved in separate story lines, that as the film plays out, slowly approach and tie into a more central story revolving around an attempted robbery. The multiple story lines are fairly engaging, and at times very funny with very witty dialogue, especially in relation to Sally the mustache girl. Intermission isn't a movie probably everyone will like, but I thought it was interesting and worthy of a rental.",6.0,renodc,2004/12/30,33,17
597,Taxi Driver,Live it and lose it,"Scorsese's best. Not too many hyper-critical reviews of this film have anything near as intelligent to say about what the director and the screenwriter had in mind when they created this American gem. To those people that have seen it and thought it was ""slow"" or the pacing was sub par, they don't know what they're talking about; ""Taxi Driver"" is about the gradual and eventual take-over of insanity, and not about violence, action-shoot-'em-up 'slash' car chase... or whatever they expected from it. The modern audience today is expecting everything--comedy, drama, unbearable suspense, spfx--all rolled-up into one-stop entertainment... and no, I'm not anybody's grandfather, or here to tell you that movies were great in my day, but, viewers, lighten up already. De Niro, and the rest of the cast, do a serviceable job in this micro-cosmic window into the life of Travis Bickle--a Vietnam vet--who, true, writes mind-numbing entries in his diary, leads a, for the most part, dull existance as a cabbie, and strikes out with a female political campaigner who, after Travis becomes a hero, discovers she is indeed attracted to unstable, sometimes violent chauffeurs. The rest of this movie's story is for the less initiated viewer; decide whether you've truly become desensitized to sexual and violent content in today's films... Ah, forget it!

It's over-stylised, over-loud, over-acted, (sorry Samuel, Tim, John, Uma & Bruce) and the non-linear narrative so favoured by the director simply doesn't work. But it's fashionable, so it's popular.

With that said there characters have gotta act like dumb asses half the time and after a while it does get kinda boring. Ill give the movie credit as it does try and be different which i actually liked. The addition of Chris pine is also a plus to the movie and he had some really funny moments. However Christoph waltz is a different story. He wasn't bad in the movie but he wasn't in the movie enough which is kind of disappointing. Actually that is another big flaw with this movie. There are so many characters in this movie and they are all kinda pointless and didn't need to be there at all. Kevin spacey,Jennifer anniston and Jamie foxx characters feel like there in this movie just because they were in the previous one which is stupid. Or though Kevin spacey one scene is pretty awesome so there is that. Overall horrible bosses 2 was enjoyable but i wont be rushing to go see it again",4.0,louis_southwood,2014/12/14,17,8
604,Interstellar,Disappointed,"I am a Nolan fan but, and perhaps that's why, I see Interstellar as a failed magic act. The multi-layered surprise and amazement that we have come to expect of Nolan's films did not deliver. I believe this particular film, like Prometheus, failed due to the maker's inherent desire to create an epic - it took on too much, tried too hard and did it all wrong. I'm willing to suspend disbelief for the sake of artistic creativity, assume space suits and modern telecommunication systems pass unscathed through black holes (and really, who knows?) but there are things that cannot be excused with the budget and resources at the disposal of this genius film-making team (such as bad script and poor plot planning). IDEA / PLOT The overarching idea is good, if not new. I found it hard to feel amazed by the (too many) plot twists. Ultimately the combination of all of them was tepid. We were expecting Murphy to be older than Cooper midway onwards. Murphy's brilliant solution leading to mankind's escape from earth failed to awe. Firstly - a massive stretch on the Morse code / quantum data, secondly - the two laugh-out-loud ""eureka"" moments - and thirdly, the ""aha"" factor on seeing the new, curved reality space station was completely missing that feeling - ""aha, so that was it, that's what it was all about"". More failures - Matt Damon segue and the very overdone ""ghost"" revelation. SYMBOLISM / KEY TWIST The portrayal of the time dimension within a three dimensional world in the form of the undulating bookshelf wall was beautifully rendered. However everything else about that scene felt wrong - the space-suited Cooper - would he have stayed in exactly that form inside a singularity even if future advanced beings - them / us - have helpfully carved him a neat 3-D nook in a 5-D world? This needed exploration and some complexity. The continuation of his radio communication equipment felt way too convenient, the whole frantic scene ""explained"" again by the unexplained rush that's a hallmark of this film. So, although the symbolic setup was good, I had to work hard to suspend disbelief - to get Cooper to the back of the bedroom wall and have him throw out clues using gravity and love as forces transcending dimensions - why back of the wall? Why not front? Why did the space-time continuum stop him there (that you can't go back in the time dimension, does not explain how he could gravitationally interfere with that particular room - in the past - and why he couldn't, I don't know, leave a Morse code message to himself well before all of this happened? Also, why his daughter? We get no clue in the first part of the film why this duo in particular is chosen, the only hint to Murhpy's future proclivity for the sciences coming from a penchant for decoding Morse and Michael Caine's all- forgiving view of her as a""firebrand"" or something such.) PACING / DIALOG Plot pacing was terrible (variously too slow and too fast). Dialog was terrible. It would have benefited from further revision and thought around how to present this particular story to the layman. I found myself wondering how an actor of Matt Damon's caliber did not just wave a huge red flag when he had to say why Prof Brand knew the mission would fail -""because he could not reconcile quantum physics with the theory of relativity"" (not a direct quote). Even if he isn't a physicist. The only lines I can still recall liking in the film are by Dylan Thomas (also overused). PRESENTATION I write this with only an armchair enthusiasm for physics, familiarity limited to the most dumbed-down works of Stephen Hawking. I found most of the science concepts used very trite - wormholes, black holes, relativity, time dilation - trite because of their portrayal as convenient plot tools. Having agreed in an extreme and completely unexplained hurry to leave his family behind perhaps forever, we then find out that Cooper needs to be told these concepts one at a time using, at varying moments, a folded paper pierced by a pen, oyster/pearl metaphors, and a suddenly-presented love interest for Anne Hathaway (that plot point on love being an unexplained force was particularly deeply unconvincing). I understand some of the angles needed to be explained to most people, but Nolan has done hard things more elegantly in the past. That is where one expected Nolan to deliver. As things were it made you wonder the entire time why this crew was the best of humanity. Murphy's law, indeed. ACTING Matthew McConaughey's drawl was sporadic and seemed unnecessary. His character did not convince me either that he was the guy who is most capable of being spontaneously recruited for an urgent NASA mission (and what if he had refused?), nor that he was the guy who loved his daughter in a unique way that transcended dimensions (or more so than anyone else), nor even as a suitable candidate to return from this odyssey with all its shenanigans through black holes, gyrating space stations and a cracked space helmet (!) We never know his history well enough. Anne Hathaway and the rest of the crew were no more impressive. Michael Caine was convincing, but ultimately confusing, as his confession left more questions asked than answered. TARS stole the show, and should have had more lines. EFFECTS / SCORE The effects were not comparable to Gravity. I wondered why their spacecraft was not equipped with the basic equipment to check metrics / giant waves / frozen clouds / landing conditions when any commercial satellite today will do that for you and tell you where you are to a foot's accuracy. But, details. The score was beautiful, and one of Zimmer's best. What a waste.",4.0,megha27,2014/11/08,1478,673
605,Intermission,A solid piece of entertainment,"Intermission is one of those modern multiple storyline films in which a group of characters lives intertwine. And, as per usual involves a car crash. These factors tie it to the likes of Magnolia, Amores Perros, 21 Grams, Crash, 13 Conversations About One Thing and many more films I'm sure that escape me at this point. So what does Intermission have to offer that these films do not? For one, the acting talent involved is pretty much a who's who of Irish (and Scottish) actors at present. Colin Farrell, Cillian Murphy, Colm Meaney, Shirley Henderson and Kelly Macdonald. The other main factor in the quality of Intermission lies in it's script, which comes across as funny, engaging and despite the comparisons made above is fairly original. It is most definitely a lighter affair than some of it's contemporary rivals listed above, and though not groundbreaking by any means, is a well-made and engaging piece of work.",7.0,The_Triad,2006/11/20,25,20
606,Taxi Driver,A story about a lonely man,"Taxi Driver is one of the best films ever made. This is one of those films that you do not get tired of seeing and every time you watch it you realize a little detail that you have not seen before. Excellent actors, a good director, an impressive soundtrack and a real story are the main appeals of this film. This film is about loneliness, about the isolation of a man in a society full of scum. His objective is to finish with the scum of the streets. The story uses a taxi driver as a metaphor of loneliness and it has some kind of irony because we can see that a city which is full of people can be the most lonely place for a man. The long nights in the city, the night environment full of whores, junkies, pimps and thieves are the main elements of the world in which Travis Bickle lives. Travis is an misunderstood guy who is seeking desperately for some kind of company because as he says 'loneliness has followed me all my life, everywhere' but at the same time he seems not to do anything to avoid his situation and it is seen when he goes with Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) to a porn cinema. At the end of the film the character makes real his most violent fantasies, with a look of certain soldiers from Vietnam, and he behaves like this because of his loneliness, his alienation and because he does not find any sense to his life. The violent behaviour becomes Travis into a hero, although he had killed many people and he could do it again. Although he acts with an extreme violence the spectator understand him and the reasons why he acts that way. The soundtrack of the film, which is composed by Bernard Herrmann, inspires some kind of loneliness and sometimes it is absolutely terrifying like in a horror film. This music and the slow camera showing the streets help to introduce the spectator into the world of Travis, to know what he is thinking about. In general I cannot say any negative aspect of this film because I have not found anything bad. Although it is a film of the 70s it is not an old-fashioned movie because the essence of the story, the reality that is shown on it, can be perfectly referred to the current society. This film has the privilege of having made famous the sentence You talking' to me? You talking' to me?' which will remain in the history of cinema. This is an authentic masterpiece.",,david_vigues,2004/05/16,454,359
607,Detachment,Depressive View of a Sick and Dysfunctional Society,"Henry Barthes (Adryen Brody) is a high-school substitute teacher emotionally detached from everyone but his grandfather. When he was a seven year-old boy, he saw his mother committing and he is a traumatized and sad man. Henry is assigned to work for one-month in a decadent public school and along this period, he meets the teenage prostitute Erica (Sami Gayle) on the streets and he brings her to his apartment to take care of her. In his class, he feels affection for the troubled student Meredith (Betty Kaye) and tries to help her. These adolescents change his emotions toward people. ""Detachment"" is a depressive view of the sick and dysfunctional modern society though the routine of a substitute teacher that makes the difference in the universe of teenagers, parents and other teachers. There are memorable scenes, like the breakdown of the counselor Dr. Doris Parker (Lucy Liu); or Henry explaining to the students the importance of reading to create their own thoughts and beliefs; or Henry saying that parenthood should require curriculum. On the other side, the reaction of Ms. Sarah Madison when Henry is hugging Meredith is impressive and part of a morally corrupted society that only can see vicious in a sympathetic gesture. My vote is seven. Title (Brazil): ""O Substituto"" (""The Substitute"")",7.0,claudio_carvalho,2013/12/25,17,15
608,The Fault in Our Stars,Well-Meaning Tears!,"To anybody to sees The Fault in Our Stars, male or female, be sure to have a tissue handy. I have seen a countless number of films, and I confess this is the film that may have teared me up the most. This realistic story about two teens with cancer coming together is so sweet, but there is also an emotional weight added to the story because of the subject matter. The film doesn't try to be saccharine, but it tries to be sincere. The movie has a light-hearted tone for the most part, despite the dark subject matter and that I can truly be happy with. Josh Boone's film is about two kids named Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters who fall in love with each other when they meet at a cancer support group. Together they go on adventures with nothing to stop them, not even the Grim Reaper. The film is truly well-acted. Shailene Woodley deserves an Oscar nomination for this role. Her charisma is inspiring and this may be her best performance to date. Ansel Elgort is not too shabby himself. I loved his quirky personality and despite his problems, still has the ability to keep his witty charm. Nat Wolff was very good as Augustus's friend, who had cancer rob him of his eyesight. Laura Dern turned a sympathetic performance as Hazel's mother and Willem Dafoe gave an hateful, but very good performance as the author who influences Hazel. Overall, The Fault in Our Stars is an incredible film. It's a very deep, thought-provoking movie It goes in a lot deeper than a normal romance film would do, and that adds more effect to the film. By the time the end credits rolled, my eyes were dripping with tears and to say that's rare while watching a film is an understatement. A powerful, well- meaning story about cancer-stricken teens falling into such a passionate love. My Grade: A+",10.0,g-bodyl,2015/05/01,13,8

612,The Chorus,A Real Choir MASTER,"To the best of my knowledge Gerard Jugnot is completely unknown in England despite having acted in some 76 films, written 14 and directed 9. He was part of a group named Splendid who began in the cafe-theatres of Paris in the eighties and a fair percentage - Thierry Thermitte, Josiane Blasko are two names that will be familiar to both English and American audiences - have gone on to carve out successful movie and/or theater careers. Ironically, the second lead in The Choristes, Francois Berleand has appeared in several films that were seen outside France but the irony is that he could get a job tomorrow as a Richard Dreyfus look-alike and it was, of course, Dreyfus who starred in Mr.Holland's Opus, the film to which the Choristes is destined to be compared if not measured against. Currently this entry is making a lot of noise at the French Box Office and deservedly so if anybody asks you. Jugnot strikes just the right note (not really sorry about that) as the new teacher on the block in a school for hard cases but unlike Richard Dadier (or, Glenn Ford, whichever is the greater) his attempts to reach the kids via music is NOT abortive. For those who can't resist footnotes to other movies this one also has a touch of the Cinema Paradisos inasmuch as it begins with the death of a mentor and a now Internationally successful artist (for movie director read conductor) reminisces about his childhood and the influence upon it of said mentor. In a perfect world this movie WILL be shown in England and/or America and a great many more mavens will know what the cognoscenti have known for years, that Jugnot can make it even without the Paycock. 9/10",,writers_reign,2004/04/14,33,19
613,Blackfish,Film Moves With Fluidity of Wild Orca,"The documentary ""Blackfish"" just premiered at Sundance to much deserved rave reviews. It's a compelling story of a 12,000 pound orca who has been in captivity since 1983 when he was captured at the age of two. New footage and interviews with trainers who worked at SeaWorld (and left disillusioned) add dynamic interest to the overall question of whether or not these wild intelligent sentient animals should be kept in captivity. This is a story that will have you questioning what you thought you knew. See ""Blackfish"" if you're interested in orcas; see it if you're interested in the truth; see it for no other reason than to find out why SeaWorld doesn't want you to see it. This film moves with the fluidity of a wild orca in the ocean. Don't miss out on seeing ""Blackfish"" because it's going to change the way you think.",10.0,yazerin,2013/02/02,136,117
614,Moon,"Dad, there's someone asking about Mom  Moon","Moon is ostensibly a one-man show featuring Sam Rockwell as an astronaut sent to the moon on a three-year contract to maintain a mining station that harvests the sun's fusion energy from moonrocks. We are thrown into the mix with only two weeks left in his tenure, the desire to return to his wife and daughter, whom he has never seen in real life yet, strong and his psyche all but ready to break from the lack of human interaction. Sam Bell has been keeping busy by utilizing a treadmill, watching old Nick at Nite type sitcoms, whittling away at a wooden model of his hometown with an X-acto knife, and conversing with the station's artificial intelligence GERTY. The live feed to Earth has been disengaged for a while now, leaving this monotonous voice and bright yellow smiley face—complete with changing expressions—of Kevin Spacey his only friend. Sure he gets to record video packages for his wife and bosses at Lunar Industries, and they reply back to him, but the distance needed to travel is great and the time between too long. Cabin fever has definitely set in as Sam begins to zone out and manifest a woman, first sitting down in his chair and then out on the moon's surface while he is out for a routine check. Both instances cause him to forget what he was doing, causing great personal harm and injury. When the real trouble occurs, however, is the moment—as seen in the trailer—he brings back a body from the surface that appears, for all intents and purposes, to be him. This is the point where talking about Moon gets a little difficult so as to not ruin the mystery that should be unsolved when you sit down to watch the film. The trailer portrays a story that seems to beg the question of whether the second Sam is truly there or only in his imagination as he slowly goes insane. I won't divulge the answer, but instead say that it gets solved fairly quickly. So, instead of the film becoming a psychological thriller with a big reveal at its conclusion, Duncan Jones' story becomes complete science fiction, bringing in moral questions about technological advances we in 2009 are just beginning to wrestle with. This aspect, while at first threatening to ruin my experience as I entered thinking the question of whether Sam number two was real or not would be the backbone to the tale, became so important to my enjoyment. Rather than a look inside the psyche of this man, isolated for so long, we are given a tense race against time as Sam must discover what is happening and think of a way to get out from under it all before the ELIZA rescue team arrives from Earth, an event that could have very dire consequences. I don't want to ruin too much, but let me just say that the clock is counting down to his death, an ending that could be caused by many different factors, (failing health, execution by those coming, etc.), that also begs the question of whether he is in fact alive in the first place. I have to say that Jones and screenwriter Nathan Parker put together a taut thrill ride that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The pacing is deliberate and rapid all at the same time, the art direction pristine, and the camera tricks very impressive. Sam Rockwell is a major part of this as it is definitely the best work of his career. Not only is he on screen for the entire run time, about 80% of it is playing opposite a computer or himself. The pressures being put upon his shoulders, the fear of what may be happening, about his very own existence, weigh down his emotional strength and it shows. The outbursts, the sarcasm, the joking around to anger his doppelganger, and the heartbreaking realization of what is going on show through with perfection. This is his shining moment, proving his craft and ability to act above and beyond the ""funny guy"" he is often relegated to play. Especially when pitted against such a stark background of clinical white futuristic rooms or the vacuum of space, the angst, joy, disbelief, and fortitude of his humanity are all that we are able to see, his performance is paramount to the film's success. I know that, as far as storyline goes, this review remains somewhat vague besides expressing the visceral tension and underlying mystery waiting to be solved, but I believe that is for your own viewing pleasure. While the trailer is not necessarily misleading, it posits a question that is answered early on as being the main crux of the entire film. That possibility of more than one Sam Bell or of a man who's hold of reality has been broken may be what you went into the film expecting to see. Well you will just see it sooner than expected and as a lead into the real story of survival, identity, and the idea of home. In that respect, having the trailer's mystery solved only means more time for unexpected story lines; it may have gotten you into the seats, but it is only the beginning of what this science fiction classic-in-waiting has to offer.",10.0,jaredmobarak,2009/07/11,75,50

616,The Chorus,Not what I remembered,"I saw this movie 13 years ago when it first came out, and I remember I really loved it. Watching it tonight on TV, I didn't experience the enjoyment I remember feeling back in 2004. Part of it may have to do with the fact that the music probably made a stronger effect on me in the theater, with a more powerful sound system. Listening to it tonight though just the TV speakers, I found that, while it is beautifully sung by the boys' choir, it is basically all affect with no real substance. Compare it with that of its old American counterpart, the Bing Crosby Christmas class *Going My Way.* Anyone can remember the songs that boys' choir sings, *When you wish on a star* or even the rather bland *Going my way*. None of the music in *Les Choristes* sticks in the memory like that. The acting is certainly first-rate, starting with Gérard Jugnot, one of my favorite actors. He isn't given a lot to work with here, though. There is no real conflict in his character, nothing for the actor to work with. The school director is uniformly evil, the other characters, even the boys, without three dimensions. It's all very pleasant, certainly, and I was never bored a moment. But it all seems rather obvious. The end is strange, looked at with today's eyes. I couldn't help thinking that today Mathieu would be prosecuted for kidnapping, at the very least, and probably be held in suspicion of child molestation, which is sad and certainly not an issue in this movie. I'd have to go back and watch the beginning of the movie, the frame, again to see if there is any indication of whether Mathieu raised Pépinot. An enjoyable movie, certainly. There just isn't much to it dramatically.",7.0,richard-1787,2017/11/12,0,0

October Sky is inspirational, uplifting, touching, and humorous. The movie also has a very positive message about the benefits of a good education. Education was the way out and the way up for the boys in this town, which is a good message for all teens. This is the first time we saw Jake Gyllenhaal in a movie, and we were so impressed with him.

618,Crash,"Another Hollywood issue movie: trite, poorly written & not even remotely believable","The fact that a movie this trite can win an Academy Award speaks volumes about Hollywood's understanding of race relations. Here's a movie that presents a racist white cop feeling up a black woman (who doesn't file a harassment suit) and then (by pure coincidence) pulls her from a burning car one second before it blows up, and she looks back at him afterward and smiles as if to say, ""hey let's go out on a date"". Here's a movie that portrays someone shooting someone of another race (out of revenge), but, surprise! no one gets hurt. Here's a movie that manages to cram in almost every racial group into it, but completely steers clear of queers, yes an LA without gays....or gay jokes/slurs. Lots of completely annoying characters angrily spouting off dialog that was clearly written by someone who doesn't have a clue about how people really talk, all in the service of making various racial issues obvious to middle America...and to a completely insipid New Age soundtrack that attempts to keep the audience awake when nothing is happening (and succeeds because of how annoying it is). But, hey, all you need is slick cinematography and a good PR machine and no one will be the wiser, judging from the IMDb rating. ""City of Hope"" did the intertwined story thing first & much better, ""Do The Right Thing"" tackled racism far more subtly than this schlock fest, and ""Falling Down"" did the angry LA racism thing much more believably. ""Crash"" epitomizes everything that is wrong with America: it's unoriginal, it lacks subtlety or believability, it attempts to be all things to all people, and it insists on pronouncing how good it is in spite of its obvious flaws.",4.0,MiloMindbender,2007/04/07,20,14
619,Goodfellas,Is Being A Gangster Better Than Being President of the United States? Goodfellas Clearly Says No.,"Roebrt De Niro,Ray Liotta and Joe Pesci star in this film about the mob and gangsters in ""Goodfellas"". Based on the bestselling book of Nicholas Pillegi, director Martin Scorsese provides the viewer of a clear picture of what being part of organized crime is all about. Goodfellas is a true story that is being told on the eyes of Henry Hill,who spent 25 years of his life being a member of the mob from 1955 to 1980, until he became an informant and made deals with the FBI to bring down and put behind the bars his mob underboss Paul Cicero and his fellow mobster, Jimmy ""The Gent"" Conway. The story whose script was co-written by Scorsese and Pileggi narrates Hill's story on how he started being of service with the mob when he was 12 years old when he considered being a gangster is better than being the President of the United States until he became a full-time gangster who was involved in extortion,hijacking,stealing,robberies and murders together with Tommy DeVito and Jimmy ""The Gent"" Conway when he became an adult. It shows how much money he has had that made him and his wife - Karen Hill - have made their married life extremely comfortable,appealing and glamorous.Added to that,the viewer is treated to the glory years - the 50's,60's and 70's - of the mob when these crime families have many law enforcers in their pockets and how much impact they had in American society until they started to decline and experience downfall in the 80's when the FBI started to intensify their campaign against the mob and putting these mobsters into prison. No question that we have a great film.There are many reasons behind it.First,the viewer is given a clear portrait of the mob's way of life particularly the life of crime as told by Henry Hill.It definitely does not intend to put any glamor into their way of life as it clearly shows how violent this way of life is despite the money that they are able to earn.This was shown particularly in the scenes wherein Tommy DeVito,portrayed by Pesci in an Oscar winning role,shoots Spider on the foot and later killed him by shooting his chest six times after losing his temper.It also shows how much crime they commit in their daily life.Added to that,it also demonstrates how mob life has declined throughout the years starting in the 1980's when the FBI intensified in bringing down members of the mob and putting them behind bars with the use of advancement in technology that the Feds are using particularly in investigating mobsters. It definitely shows that the mob no longer has the same impact unlike during their glory years from the 1950's to the 1970's and the viewer probably laughing to Henry's mindset that being a gangster is better than becoming US President.Many will see that Henry himself became an FBI informant and corroborate against his fellow mobsters in the end receive lighter sentence instead of spending the rest of his life in jail. Aside from these reasons,we also get to see a lot of great performances from De Niro,Liotta,Sorvino,Bracco,who was nominated for an Oscar Best Supporting Actress; and Pesci,who won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.In addition to performances,we also get to see a great direction from Scorsese that told the story in a fast pace that made 2 hour and 28 minute movie far from being boring; and a wonderful screenplay from Scorsese and Pileggi as well that made many scenes memorable up to day since this was first shown in the theaters many years ago back in 1990. No wonder the ""Goodfellas"" remains popular today since it was released 27 years ago.",10.0,RealChristian14,2017/09/07,10,6

It's the first time (or the second I'm not sure!) that I get into the mood of writing a review. The reason, I guess, is because this film is the fifth in the top 250 ranking and I couldn't see why. The curiosity of the ranking was also the reason of watching it at the first place. There is a high end casting and a top level director but nothing more, IN MY OPINION.

622,Goodfellas,Ugly Movie,"Semi-spoiler On a personal note...this movie was filmed, in part, in front of my family's home (the red house across from Bracco's ""home"" in the movie...you know the scene...Ray Liotta runs across the street and pistol whips the neighbor's son, who is polishing his red Corvette - since I was, in reality, the son who lived across the street, I suppose, that was me taking all that punishment). Anyway, I was home visiting when they filmed for over a month on my street. It was interesting to watch the care (bordering on fanaticism) that Scorcese took in endlessly rehearsing minor scenes and then finally filming them. Which leads me to my point. So much time, money, and effort spent to produce such an unpleasant film. Lord knows, it's not that everybody needs to be Pollyanna...we all are aware how truly wretched life can be...but why spend time watching loathsome, worthless characters act out pointless violence? There just has to be some better way of spending our time. Yep, we are base animals...as Scorcese incessantly likes to remind us in this and his other films...Thank you! We get the idea! However, why not take all that talent and time and produce something the uplifts the human spirit rather than denigrates it? ""A man's reach should exceed his grasp, or what's a heaven for?"" Glorify gangsters, not me! OK...Goodfellas lovers...come on and pistol whip me...I'm waiting.",1.0,maybe43,2003/06/02,285,108
623,Detachment,The BLACKBOARD JUNGLE of the 21st century and one of the year's best films; Brody's best since THE PIANIST.,"DETACHMENT (2012) **** Adrian Brody, Christina Hendricks, Marcia Gay Harden, Lucy Liu, James Caan, Blythe Danner, Tim Blake Nelson, William Petersen, Bryan Cranston, Sammi Gayle, Betty Kaye, Louis Zorich. Scathing indictment of the American educational system from agent provocateur filmmaker Tony Kaye features a terrific, low-key modulated performance by Brody (his best since copping the Oscar in THE PIANIST) as a haunted New York high school substitute teacher who finds himself at odds with the indifference, angst and anomie of his young charges and the push-pull relationship with a teen prostitute (amazing newcomer Gayle) he takes in under his wing. Brody's sad-sack demeanor and the most expressive eyes on screen since Bette Davis speaks volumes for his anguished character, Henry Barthes, and a stellar ensemble including Caan as a seen-it-all-world-weary colleague and veteran character actor Zorich as his dementia-addled grandfather. Kudos also to Kaye for using his real-life daughter Betty as Barthes' most loyal student with a burden to bare throughout the film until its heady climax that only falters in an otherwise fine screenplay by Carl Lund.

624,Intermission,A Clever story makes a great film,"The scene before the starting credits will make you sit up and realise that you are about to see something special. Its an excellently written story, and the cast all do a great job. Being from Dublin, its probably much easier for me to appreciate the film, it will be interesting to see how foreign audiences take to it. There's a lot of Dublin slang in the dialog, but you'll get used to it quite soon, much in the same way as the London Slang in ""Lock Stock..."". The film itself follows 4 distinct storylines that are all intertwined to eachother, leaving a sense of satisfaction with how everything ties together. Its very funny and very cool, to call it an Irish version of ""Lock, Stock and two smoking Barrells"" is the biggest complement I can give this film.",,ro_bilco,2003/10/21,3,0
625,Detachment,A neo-masterpiece,"It's a cliché to say that Adrien Brody delivers an epic performance, let's face it. When didn't he do such a thing?! The trick in this movie is the breath-taking performance of supporting actors. Sami Gayle is entering the domain of the elite and it's such a shame that her role and acting in this movie is in parallel lines with her small time, shallow role in ""Blue Bloods"" , so people (including me) might think she's just a new next-door beauty before watching ""Detachment"" . Furthermore, James Caan, Tim Blake Nelson, Lucy Liu and of course Marcia Gay-Harden all deliver greatly. Plot-wise, this isn't your every now and then ""American Beauty-influenced"" drama. This movie stands out with a new forwards and backwards flow of characters and their approach. In addition, the reality aspect (to the limit of scare) is at its best where the audience are somehow involved in the movie!!! In my humble opinion, critics should have had it right naming Adrien at least as an Oscar nominee and the movie, too.",10.0,Raed_911,2013/11/22,4,3

628,The Green Mile,Most emotional film I've ever watched,"This movie is a masterpiece, plain and simple. It is well acted, has a beautiful story, a fantastic ending and is extremely emotional. I'd like to focus on the latter, and if you want a more ""normal"" review, there's plenty of those on this site. Let me tell you about about three ways this movie absolutely toyed with my emotions in ways I did not expect; 1. It made me cry more than Forrest Gump. This is truly a feat, and a record I thought never would be broken. 2. It made me despise a character even more than Joffrey from Game of Thrones. Yet another truly hard task. 3. It made me walk away from the screen with my ears covered and eyes closed, for the first time since I was little. I just couldn't stand the shocking brutality of what I was watching. This raw emotion is what I believe is the true strength of this film, and what sets it apart from other movies. If there's any movie at all out there that's deserving of a 10/10 rating, this is certainly one of them. Stunning.",10.0,Oliveraandreasson,2020/01/27,2,2

630,Detachment,Excellent Cinematic Experience!,"What an excellent cinematic experience! Tony Kaye has done an excellent job portraying the 'existential angst' that all of us feel at sometime or the other. If emotions were like colors on a palette, the movie is a painting masterpiece. The pain and suffering that each character goes through; the search of an identity, the burden of past mistakes, redemption and forgiveness, the heart-wrenching pain of separation and the exuberant joy of reunion and so much more...It really made me feel that through this project, the actors and everyone else associated with this movie would have actually experienced 'the weighing down' effect of living that we all feel one or the other time. It had a deep impact on me. After watching this movie, I felt that I have a responsibility to do something to reduce human suffering. If not anything else at least a prayer. Thank you Tony & Adrien for an emotionally charged, thought-provoking experience!",10.0,ssamsonk,2012/03/18,104,86
631,Goodfellas,WYLION - Good or bad fellas?,"As said in the words from the movie, Goodfellas definitely whacked the competition! Aside from The Godfather and it's little brother The Godfather Part II, in my opinion, Goodfellas takes third in terms of Gangster movies. From the excellent performances of Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro, to the extreme tension near the end of the movie. This is one you need to see in your life time. But, of course no movie is perfect. Where two of the main characters shine, the lead does not. A clear example of this shows in one particular part of the movie. Early on in the movie there is a scene where Tommy (Joe Pesci), Jimmy (Robert De Niro) and Henry (Ray Liotta) turn up to Tommy's mothers house after murdering Billy Batts. Famously, the conversations in this scene were improvised. When sticking to that theme though, Ray Liotta was famously quiet. This was pretty obvious as it was pointed out by Tommy's mother in the movie (Catherine Scorsese). I give my praise to Martin Scorsese for making what is and probably always will be a movie classic.",9.0,WYLION-SOTIRISKING,2019/06/15,5,3
632,Spider-Man 2,One of the Best Superhero Films,"In the second installment of the Spider-Man saga, Sam Raimi brings us one of the best comic book/superhero movies ever. I still remember how blown away I was after watching this movie in theaters after it's initial release. The action, the story, the special/visual effects...everything was spectacular and came together to create an awesome ride. Two years after the events of the first film, Peter Parker is struggling to balance his real life with his role as Spider-Man. He's unable to keep a job, failing his college courses, and ruining his friendship with longtime love Mary Jane Watson; on top of all that, his best friend obsesses over Spider-Man's role in the death of his father. Meanwhile, an experiment to create fusion by nuclear physicist Otto Octavius leaves him with four metal tentacles welded to his body and an insane desire to recreate the dangerous experiment, risking the lives of half of New York City. Where do I begin? I absolutely loved this movie. The first movie was a great film as well, but it's sequel seemed to take everything a step farther. I felt the story was better in this installment; it manages to fit in so much development but never feels overwhelming and without losing the audience in too much plot. The film concentrates on Peter's personal troubles just as much as it does the Doc Ock storyline. In fact, Doc Ock's transformation doesn't even occur until nearly 40 minutes into the film, but with so much else to absorb, it doesn't hurt the film. And once Doc Ock emerges, the movie only gets better from there with great battles and memorable moments. The hospital scene in which Doc Ock awakens is probably the best scene in the movie (and oozes with Raimi's style) and the battles between hero and villain are some of the best superhero battles created for film. Alfred Molina and the actual character of Doc Ock ranks as one of my top favorite villain performances. Raimi made Octavius and sympathetic character in the film, rather than completely evil, and Molina was a perfect fit for the role. While I was a huge fan of Willem Dafoe and his Green Goblin in the first film, I feel Molina and Doc Ock have topped him. We also get great returning performances from the key players: Maguire, Dunst, Franco, Harris, and Simmons. You can tell they've all become comfortable with the roles at this point and are grasping their characters even better than before. We're also introduced to Mr. Ditkovich (Elya Baskin), Peter's landlord, who injects some humor into the story. As you can see from my rambling, I was a huge fan of this movie and, as much as I've seen it, it never gets old. While it's not the greatest comic book adaptation out there, it definitely ranks with the best. Director Sam Raimi proves that he was meant for this franchise, embracing it and improving with the sequel.",9.0,brando647,2008/09/10,3,3
633,Primal Fear,Not just another court room drama,"I was convinced that ""Primal Fear"" would be the type of courtroom drama that Hollywood seems to use to pave the streets with. You know what I mean: Someone gets wrongly accused of some mischief, he can't pay a lawyer, but of course there is one who is really interested in the case and he is prepared to defend the poor guy anyway. The defender finds some wholes in the police investigation or in the statement of the other party and knows to prove the innocence of his client and even get a big indemnity. Well, I was wrong, for once this was a courtroom drama that had a bit more to offer than the usual story line and twists. In fact, this was even a very enjoyable movie. Even though I'm not really a fan of Richard Gere (I'm not a woman, so no I don't like him because the way he looks, I only look at his acting), I have to admit that this time he really did a very good job as the slick, media-friendly, arrogant lawyer Martin Vail. Still, in my opinion the real star in this movie is Edward Norton. He's really excellent as the altar boy who is accused of murdering a Catholic bishop. For once the story isn't as predictable as usual. At first the case seems rather clear: an altar boy is running away from the home of the bishop, with blood all over his clothes. No doubt about it you think, he did it, case closed, next movie! But than the first interesting twist in the movie appears: Yes, he was at the murder scene, but he can't remember anything about the grisly murder, because at that exact moment he got a blackout. He's convinced that there was a third person in the room. That third person must have killed the bishop, he's innocent. His lawyer tries to prove the third man theory in the court room, but as the process comes nearer to the end, some new evidence will make everything a lot clearer and more interesting... As I already said, this movie is more than just worth a watch, thanks to the rather innovative story line and characters. For once, this movie didn't annoy me more than I could ever like it. That's already worth a lot, so I give it a well deserved 8/10.",8.0,philip_vanderveken,2005/01/26,171,142
634,The Chorus,One of the french greats,"I remember watching this movie with my family when i was 7 years old and having a strong emotional reaction to it. However each time i have the chance of re-viewing the movie wether it maybe at school or a rainy day the same feeling when i was 7 comes back. This for me is due, first through the portrayal of these children treated harshly by the school's director with strict rules ""Action...Reaction..."". However one relationship in the movie that always hits me is the unforced love between the student Pépino and the teacher Monsieur Mathieu. This is probably as a young age i attached myself to the youngest child of the group. When growing up I began to notice the subtle hints of their growing relationship throughout the film and never forcing it to the viewer, was done perfectly The second success of the movie is the soundtrack. When making a film which portrays the beauty and benefits of singing and music it has to be impeccable, Christophe Barratier did not disappoint. Each song is as lovely to listen and some humorous touch added to the singing scenes always makes me smile.

635,Blackfish,"If you have ever enjoyed a childhood experience at SeaWorld, you do not watch this documentary.","Blackfish takes you on an emotional journey through the lives of Dawn Brancheau's fellow trainers and the orcas that they worked with. The largest male orca held in captivity, Tilikum, was responsible for the death of Ms. Brancheau during a SeaWorld performance. This documentary shows footage of the supposed capture of Tilikum, presumably from when he was only 2 years old. One of the first particularly emotional moments came when a seaman recalled his experiences with rounding up and snatching the baby orcas from the rest of their pod. The now elderly man says that it was quite possibly the worst thing that he had ever done in his entire life. With this account, the film takes a wild emotional journey through the orca's life, where unnecessary, tear jerking scores are being played to accompany the already miserable looking orcas. Throughout the film, numerous trainers appear in interviews about their experiences with Tilikum throughout his life. Alongside these trainers were interviews with people that had very vague credentials. One lower third in the film simply read ""Neuroscientist"", which seems very broad and indirectly related to marine wildlife. Nevertheless, the interviews did present incredibly realistic and genuine information about Orcas and their nature in the wild. The whole objective of this film is to convince you that SeaWorld killed Dawn Brancheau, and the orcas were as innocent as a beaten child. The direction of this documentary will capture the attention of nearly any audience. Every shot in the film flows well from idea to idea and contributes to the smooth transitions from happy to sad that take place throughout. The underwater shots of the various attacks in the water show just how real the danger was for the trainers. Those same underwater shots also conveyed the great level of dexterity coming from both the trainers and the orcas under the surface. The director pieces together various contexts with the use of other media, compared to just relying on the visual aspects of the film. It was easy to go from clutching a box of Kleenex to sitting on the edge of the seat in amazement. Blackfish highly personifies the orcas with every opportunity they have. If you want to watch a documentary about orcas and not feel like its your fault for enjoying their aptitudes, do not watch this one. If you have ever enjoyed a childhood experience at SeaWorld, you do not watch this documentary either. There are scenes that will make you believe that the captive orca is the most depressed animal ever recorded. One particular scene shows Tilikum in his holding tank, which he appears to be resting in. By par of the director, the orchestral strings begin to pull on the strings of your heart, as it sets the scene for gloom and depression. Of course, this scene was shown after he was torn from his family. The reality is, there is no way to know if Tilikum is sleeping or crying, and the director takes advantage of that mystery. When watching this documentary, being wary of a few things can help your mind stay on track. Think about every trainer's story that is told in the beginning of the film, and remember their roots and how ""oblivious"" they were at the beginning of their SeaWorld careers. Now that they are no longer employed by SeaWorld, they have immaculate recollections of all that took place in the confines of the orca pool. Chances are, they are ex-trainers for a reason, and have every reason to speak out against their former employees. The reality lies in the fact that the orcas could not be predicted, as defined in the court case against SeaWorld. Orcas are very intelligent mammals, but very much not human. You will have to remind yourself that throughout this entire documentary; I know I did.",9.0,mtgm,2015/10/12,3,3

This wont be much of an overview of the films; just a great big thank you Mr Sam Raimi for your great comic book hero come to life. I saw what you could do with no money, a great friend/eternal hero, camera angles, and sound, with your EVIL DEAD series, and look at what you can do with a budget. This is one of those rare times when the sequel was as good if not better than the first, and i am looking forward to SPIDERMAN 3 with anticipation. I wouldn't mind seeing another A SIMPLE PLAN type of film from you either. These are some of the best action-hero comic book character(s) i've ever seen brought to life. The ensemble casts with the likes of Alfred Molina, Thomas Hayden Church, Willam Dafoe, Cliff Robertson, Kirsten Dunst, and James Franco, Bryce Dallas Howard, Theresa Russell, Topher Grace, and of course, the spiderman himself, Tobey Maguire, is a treat in itself.

637,Crash,The worst Oscar winning best picture. EVER!,"Very simply, ""Crash"" is the worst film to win the Oscar for best picture. Ever! ""Crash"" may even be the worst film to be nominated for Hollywood's highest honor. Condescending, contrived, and trite, this is the work of hacks. The screenplay violates one of the simplest but most important rules of writing in ways even a C student in screen writing would be unlikely to do. Ever heard the command to SHOW, NOT TELL? Since neither Paul Haggis nor his co-conspirators have the talent to show the effects of racism on individuals and society, they tell. And tell. And tell. The actors might as well be reciting a newspaper column, one written way back in the 60s, a decade when this pretentious, self important piece of tripe might have managed to fool even the wisest among us that it had some relevance. Then again, the 60s was the decade of ""In the Heat of the Night,"" not to mention the more obscure ""Pressure Point,"" both of which looked at race relations with unblinking honesty and a knowledge of how people really act, think, and talk. The characters in ""Crash"" are laughable stereotypes who rarely utter one word that sounds like something that would emerge from the mouth of a real human being. Not since ""Doctor Doolittle"" scored an Oscar nomination for best picture in 1967 (depriving ""In Cold Blood,"" ""Cool Hand Luke,"" and several other better films of that honor) has Oscar made a blunder as bad as giving his top prize to this dim-witted dud.",2.0,bwaynef,2006/03/23,29,19
638,Blackfish,A righteously angry film,"A disturbing and infuriating documentary about the abuse of Orcas in captivity, and how that treatment has lead in turn to a startling number of deaths and serious injuries of trainers. The film posits that taking an up to 12,000 pound creature used to freedom and traveling up to 100 miles a day with it's incredibly close extended family, capturing it and plunking it in a giant concrete swimming pool with strange whales from other pods and goading them into performing tricks multiple times a day is a good formula to lead to these intelligent and amazing creatures to slowly go crazy, and act out. It's a hard concept to argue against. This is indeed a one sided film, but there are cases where 'fair and balanced' is not an appropriate approach for a documentary. There aren't always two equal sides to every story. This is one such situation. It's very moving to hear ex—trainer after ex-trainer express their remorse for how the whales were treated, and their sadness and anger for their fallen and injured comrades, And it's deeply chilling to see so much compelling evidence that Sea World knew just how bad things were, and worked overtime to keep it from the press, the public and even the trainers themselves – many of whom were fed lies about the whales (e.g. they live longer in captivity) that they in turn fed the visiting public. The footage of the actual attacks are truly terrifying. This is not a film for kids. But it is a film to remind us of how far companies will go for a buck, and how humans can blind themselves to the sufferings of others – Orcas or other people – when it's in their short term self-interest.",9.0,runamokprods,2017/05/23,5,4
639,Primal Fear,Worth A Shot For Edward Norton's Sensational Debut Performance Alone!,"Full of twists n turns yet predictable for the most part, managing to keep the thrilling vibe in tact from start to finish, and bolstered by a spectacular performance from Edward Norton in what is his debut feature film, Primal Fear may follow a generic route but what puts it ahead of other examples of its genre is the attention provided to its characters. Based on the novel of the same name, the story of Primal Fear follows the case of a young altar boy who's accused of murdering a famous Catholic Archbishop and is represented by a Chicago defence attorney who's always looking for cases that guarantee public spotlight but soon becomes convinced that the case is far more complex than it looks. Brilliantly directed, smartly written, effectively paced, nicely photographed & mesmerisingly scored, the best thing about Primal Fear remains its performances for Richard Gere turns in a wonderful work, Laura Linney has her moments as well but the biggest contributor to the film's success is the utterly convincing & show-stealing performance from Edward Norton. On an overall scale, Primal Fear works as a fine courtroom drama & a captivating thriller but other than Norton's strong debut performance & that final twist, there is nothing memorable about it. Narrated in a manner that keeps the audience busy, Primal Fear may not rank amongst the finest example of its genre but is definitely an entertaining sit that's worth a watch for Norton's input alone.",,CinemaClown,2013/10/15,2,2
640,Ferris Bueller's Day Off,Worth seeing at least once,"Ferris Bueller's Day Off is a worthwhile movie. High school senior Ferris Bueller (Matthew Roderick) brings his best friend Cameron (Alan Ruck) and his girlfriend Sloane (Mia Sara) on a trip around Chicago when they're supposed to be in school. My main problem with that movie is the title character, Ferris. He is super popular for some reason, but he doesn't seem to care about how what he does affects other people. However, you just can't help but like him more and more as the movie progresses, probably because of Roderick's acting. What saved this movie for me was Alan Ruck as Cameron. He did a terrific job, and I never would've guessed that he was in his late 20's. I just love the way Cameron and Sloane get along; while Ferris is off singing on a parade float, they are content to stand there chatting without seeming awkward at all. This might not be the best movie in the world, but it is still quality entertainment and in my top 20 favorite movies. Just rent it and see what you think.",7.0,holeinthecerealbox,2008/04/08,3,2
641,Hotel Transylvania,A tangled mess of characters in parent-knows-best animation.,"HERE'S another animation about parents doing the thinking for their children. In Brave, a mum and and her teen daughter argue about whom the latter will marry. In Hotel Transylvania, Dracula dad (voiced by Adam Sandler) does his best to keep his teen daughter, Mavis (Selena Gomez), from stepping out into the real world or, horrors, falling in love with a human. The main thing that you'll remember after watching this high-quality production but low-quality joke fest is the chaos that permeates it. Director Genndy Tartakovsky hits you with everything he can, including weird and cuddly characters, such as werewolf Wayne (Steve Buscemi in that whiny voice of his), Invisible Man (David Spade), mummy Murray (CeeLo Green) and Frank the Frankenstein (Kevin James). There are also characters voiced by Molly Shannon, Fren Drescher and Jon Lovitz. There's so much going on that viewers will have a hard time focusing on anyone or anything. But, not to worry, you get your usual dose of fart jokes, as per required in a Sandler movie. Sandler's Dracula is so over the top with his unusual European accent that you wished he'd stuck to English. Dracula plans his daughter's 118th birthday party to welcome her into adulthood and invites monsters of all kinds to the party at his hidden castle. He, surprisingly, allows her to visit a nearby village, but what she doesn't know is that he built it and his underlings disguised themselves to look like humans out to torch her. His antipathy towards humans isn't explained initially, but it's later revealed that humans burnt down a castle, which killed his wife but spared their daughter. A bushy haired and gangling backpacking teen, Jonathan (Andy Samberg), chances upon the hotel and makes himself a menace there, but he and Mavis hit it off immediately, forcing the father to execute anti- falling-in-love-with-human measures. Mavis embraces Jonathan's nomadic lifestyle, and is touched by his visit to the Taj Mahal, built by Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his third wife. While funny events are rare in Hotel Transylvania, there are some well- crafted scenes that you wished the movie had more of, for example, the table-raising chase scene between Dracula and Jonathan, and a couple of live band performances. The movie's conclusion is that humans and monsters can get over their fear of each other and learn to get along well. [URL]",4.0,jefflouvre-435-77367,2012/09/27,28,8

644,Moon,Worthy but ultimately unsatisfying,"Interesting and worthy film but ultimately unsatisfying. I love sci-fi films especially budget indies and I would like to rate the film higher but unfortunately it wasn't for me. As a reasonably obsessed sci-fi fan I found the film to be a little pedestrian. I have seen many of the set-ups and pay-offs before. For example as a set-up for the fact that Sam Bell is a clones, the newly cloned Sam asks for sunglasses. This is a common clone set-up. New clones wear sunglasses due to the sensitivity of the eyes being used for the first time. As a set-up I found it a little common. There are other examples of recognizable set-ups running throughout the film. I was hoping for bit more ingenuity in the story and better pay- offs. Most applauded the reasonableness of the science fiction. Cloning and AI on the dark side of the moon is clearly more reasonable than Dunes Guild navigators that fold space-time by consuming vast amounts of a drug called Spice that gives them prescience to see across galaxies and into the future. I have no problem with science and magic. They are not mutually exclusive. As Arthur C.Clarke says ""any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."" When I saw the trailer I was hoping for a Philip K.Dick style existential meltdown. Reality collapsing under the weight of it's pretension. Multiple realities layered on top of each other viciously competing for validation as they unfold into a desolate future. I'm a sucker for that kind of thing. Moon is not that kind of thing. I don't want to bemoan the film to much. It was excellently acted. The production is very strong. The best use of doppelganger actors I ever seen with the exception of Dead Ringers. The CGI was very strong and painted a vivid picture of the moon. The robot AI voiced by Kevin Spacey is very well portrayed. For all it's supposed Hard Sci-Fi I still feel it wasn't really hard sci-fi. Why didn't the AI have a face. It was a very sophisticated AI with great reasoning skills and somewhat of a personality of it's own. If the engineers can do this and synthesize flawless human speech why could they not give it a face instead of about 6 or 7 emoticons. The cloning seemed fishy as well. I can't understand they would not just clone a more drone like character that was happy to serve the company. Why and how would they even attempt to embed the memories, personalities and traits of another human into a clone I don't know. Good film left me cold. People say it was an adult film. I disagree it was a film for stunted adults lacking imagination and a basic sense of cosmic wonder. Watch Herzogs The Wild Blue Yonder a film for real adults. Didn't want to be that negative. My opinion is more a counter balance to the positive reviews. I can understand the positive reviews. For the audience that gave it 10 stars you do not see a film like this too often.

Ferris Bueller's Day Off is an amazing John Hughes movie from 1986.The movie's twenty years old and yet it seems so fresh.Teens all over the world still love the movie.Oh so young Matthew Broderick shines in the lead.This movie was made for him.Just like the role of Marty McFly was made for Michael J. Fox in Back to the Future one year earlier this one was made for Matthew.All the other actors do a great job too.The young Charlie Sheen can also be seen in the movie as Boy in police station.The movie is filled with terrific scenes.One of the greatest moments is when Ferris gets up and sings Twist and Shout by The Beatles.This movie sends a great message for the kids at school.Everybody should follow Ferris' example and skip school once in a while.Let's all just get out of that class room and have a piece of the world out there.All you need is a good plan.You have to pretend you're sick.You're gonna have to be a good actor so you can fool everybody.It helps if your best friends' father has a Ferrari.It makes it all cooler.I'm kidding of course.You kids should stay at school.I'm graduating tomorrow and I haven't skipped any day of school.And no, I am not a geek.Now a few words about the movie before I finish.This is the king of all high school movies.It's entertaining, it's funny, it's serious in times.It has everything you can ever ask for a teen movie.Another thing to mention about the movie is Ferris' straight to camera monologues he gives.That thing works in this movie.That's some wise stuff he says there.It's a very well written movie.Much more intelligent than teen movies generally.Ferris Bueller's Day Off is a movie for all the high school students and those who feel like one.",10.0,Petey-10,2006/06/02,7,4
646,Intermission,Kevin Smith meets Quentin Tarantino... in Ireland.,"This is the best film i've seen in the last three months, and working at a cinema I see quite a few. It's beautifully crafted as a concept, there are about four seperate threads following completely different people, and each thread crosses over the others, touching and influencing them, without ever properly joining. The scripting is elegant, subtle and understated; fitting with the Kevin-Smith-esque surreal black comedy. The violence is often brutal and unexpected (in a Tarantino stylee), but never fully unwarranted. This might make the film seem dry and bleak (cf. Veronica Guerin, or perhaps the bitter comedy of Trainspotting), but that would be to miss the point completely - the film is designed from day one to be sharp and witty, equally as romantic and psychological as it is gritty and violent. If you're used to the normal Hollywood charade with their overblown fight sequences, storylines padded with unnecessary explanations, and cookie-cutter concepts, this film is not for you. For anyone looking for some dry-witted entertainment, you could do a lot worse than Intermission.",9.0,randomly_confused,2003/11/27,5,0
647,Spider-Man 2,Everything a comic-book movie should be,"I just saw this film at an exhibitor's screening, and it was everything a comic-book movie should be. I had low expectations, since I thought the first film was decent, but left a lot of great opportunities on the table. But not part 2. Raimi has really stepped up to the plate with this film, and created something that will be loved by both the mainstream viewer, as well as the film geeks and comic geeks. He took time with the characters, and gave Peter, M.J., Harry, and Aunt May some quality character development. We even get more of J. Jonah Jameson, which is great for the comic relief (even if I can't stop calling him 'Schillinger'). The CGI is much better this time around, and Spidey no longer looks rubbery. It is much more believable, and doesn't take you out of the moment at any point. Also, we're given a much better bad guy. Doc Ock is a fantastic villain, and much of this credit goes to Molina. He doesn't cheese it up at any point, and since Raimi gave us some time with him and his wife before the experiment goes wrong, we see that he's a kind man who wants to make the world a better place. Honestly, the film is dripping with pathos, and yet it doesn't feel like it's trying too hard to do so. And when we get to see how vulnerable Peter Parker is (wait until you see the subway car scene), we actually feel for the poor guy. This is the first comic-book film that got me to feel for the lead character, and I'm grateful for that. I'm a big fan of the X-Men movies, but this film has a lot more heart than either of those. Thinking back, I can't remember a better comic-book film. Spider-Man 2 gave me everything I wanted, and more. Kudos to Raimi for finally hitting one out of the park. I almost can't believe it, but this one is a 10/10, and I cannot wait to see it again on 6/29.",10.0,LordBling,2004/06/12,3,3

I was in awe the entire hour and 48 minutes this movie was on.

649,Crash,"Outstandingly shallow film, well-mounted, atrociously written","Everything that was wrong with MILLION DOLLAR BABY (and, for that matter, with the otherwise unrelated TRAINING DAY) is thoroughly intensified in this sorry excuse for an adult AFTERSCHOOL SPECIAL. Caricatures rage at other caricatures, dramatic events have little valid foreshadowing to give them any real weight, ridiculous and ridiculously frequent coincidences are adorably depended upon, and cheap, lazy writing comes at the audience in almost every scene. The portrayals of East Asians is particularly egregiously racist in that ""Ho-ho, aren't we clever for indulging in stereotypes that we all know are stereotypes"" way but no one in the film escapes this altogether. If letter-grading, I'd give it an F+: the first sequence between the locksmith and his daughter was well-acted enough to make me forgive its poor writing (and the encounter between the director and the younger cop is almost as not-bad), but too soon we're back to Clash of the Cardboard Cut-Outs, despite solid efforts by the cast and crew to professionalize this drivel.",1.0,foxbrick-1,2005/06/11,182,97
650,Hotel Transylvania,"Almost on the Edge of Giving It a 7, But WTH!","Hotel Transylvania is the latest Sony Pictures Animation movie. It's about Count Dracula, who builds this hotel for monsters where they can relax and be isolated from humans. But secretly, the main reason he creates it is so that his daughter will be safe from danger. So when a human accidentally enters the hotel, Dracula has to do everything he can to prevent the other guests to find out or even suspect anything about the human being a human. But at the same time, his daughter gets involved, and there's this whole comedy-thing with wacky animation and over-the-top characters and all that. Hotel Transylvania is a movie that I was very unsure if I really liked or just liked. It was kind of in the middle. But after some long thinking, I came to the conclusion that it's a very good movie that I really enjoyed. The main reason this movie is so good is because of the sense of humor. There are references to classic horror movies such as Frankenstein, The Invisible Man and The Fly. There are also just plain LOL-jokes and even a joke that directly criticizes Twilight. I mean, wow! Sony Pictures Animation have always been known for their great sense of humor (most notably in 2009's Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs). But I think this one takes the cake. But the reason I was skeptical whether I really liked it or just liked it was that the story is incredibly uninteresting. Ironically enough, for a movie that has a scene making fun of Twilight, the main plot of the movie is a love story between Dracula's daughter and the human visitor. The love story isn't bad, just cliché and forgettable. The story also doesn't really have any true twists and turns, besides one that's small and pretty insignificant. It's basically just the ""it's been a misunderstanding, we have to get back the person that misunderstood before it's too late""-type of plot points. The story also had potential. There is one scene where we learn about Dracula's past, and it's actually pretty dark and emotional. But they blew it by not doing anything with that plot and just kept on going with the romantic comedy story. With all these gripes aside, I really did enjoy Hotel Transylvania, mainly because it is such a good comedy. And not just for animation, it is right up there with being a great comedy. It's not as funny as The Dictator or Ted, obviously, but it is a very enjoyable movie that's hard not to enjoy.",8.0,ivern-326-711636,2012/10/08,4,3
651,Pulp Fiction,One-dimensional modernist pap (minor spoilers),"Is it possible that something so loathsome and awful could actually be adored and lauded by millions of people? Is it only a matter of chance that some movies are loved and others hated, regardless of their content? I hope this is true, because I cannot believe that there is actually anything good about the movie Pulp Fiction to lead any sane, reasoned, drug-free person to write the glowing comments that surround mine, much less the oodles of people who actually handed over their money to see this thing. Why is this movie so bad, you ask? Okay, I'll tell you, even though it's like pointing out why windows are transparent. Starting with the script, I see no reason to be impressed by an assemblage of overly stylistic dialogue and flat, boring characters. There is nothing amazing about two guys talking about French McDonald's restaurants, and then killing some guys. Every awful stretch of dialogue is dragged out as long as it will last, and then some. It's as if Tarantino said to himself ""I think I can cram one more line about milkshakes in here"". You have to give him credit for padding the film in ways that nobody's ever tried before. The actors look as though they're doing their best to salvage this turkey (and they are talented), all the while knowing in the back of their minds how much of a cow pie the whole thing is. As far as Tarantino's directorial style is concerned, he should just get himself a career in Nike commercials because that's where his talent level cuts off.",1.0,KubricksRube,2002/04/09,390,156
652,Moon,Not as awesome or as twisty as the hype suggests but certainly a very engaging and thoughtful sci-fi (SPOILERS),"It happens frequently but the summer blockbuster season makes it worse. Critics are keen to jump on a bad big budget film to make it out to be the worst thing ever because reviews that lay into a film are fun to write. Conversely any film that is actually ""good"" comes as such a surprise that sometimes it can be over-hyped and over-praised to the point where one goes to a ""good"" film half-expecting it to be the most amazing thing ever. That has kinda happened with Mood in two ways. Firstly it has been over-praised but secondly much of the praise has been around the ""twists"" and avoiding talking about plot points for fear of ""spoiling"" the story. I can respect this approach but in doing this the suggestion is made that this is a film full of plot revelations and twisty surprises – the former of which is sort of true but the latter is not. Moon does have a very good little story about it that is thoughtful, engaging and quite moving but it doesn't shock with revelations or twists and most viewers will be at least a few minutes ahead of where the film is going – not because the film is ""predictable"" but more because it gives the audience respect that we will be able to follow and understand for ourselves to the point where the logic of the situation pulls us along. So, for example, the reason why ""original Sam"" is getting ill is not really a mystery because it is clear that the ""3 year contract"" really means ""3 year shelf -life""; this is not spelt out for us and it is not slapped down on a table for us to see either – it just is the case and it makes sense within the film's internal logic. I can understand why some viewers have found this to translate into ""nothing happening"" or being very slow in delivery but I don't agree with them beyond acknowledging that that was their experience and opinion. To me the simple concept is very well done because it is so focused and tight. Things do not fall into a space battle with guns and explosions but, while there is a forward motion with the plot, a good chunk of the drama comes from the feelings and realisations of the two characters. That said, it is not as smart or as well done as one would have liked. The ""news coverage"" conclusion feels like it was the easiest way to produce an ending to the plot but it seems too pat and, while it feels like it was meant to ""answer questions"", by ""closing"" the story it actually reminds the viewer how many unanswered parts there are to the bigger picture. The character drama is not as good as some would say either but it is helped immensely by Rockwell giving great performance(s). He is part of the reason we feel for his character(s) and are drawn into the film. He would have benefited a great deal from more scenes that stretch him (like the live video link to his daughter) and fewer where he is hanging around but he does still give good work. The supporting cast are limited in input but while Spacey does a good job with his computer, the others are solid enough not to distract in their small roles. Visually the limited budget does show but this appears to have been accounted for by giving the entire production a rather endearing lo-fi feel that does match the reality of the future. Too often everything is shiny, white and clean as if dirt has been eliminated and expense is not a limiting factor; it feels more convincing to have things done on the cheap and be worn and old. It has been said endless times already but it does have an engaging ""70's"" feel to it and, in the wake of the mindless, boring rubbish of Transformers 2, it is nice to find something good being made under the sci-fi banner. In contrast to the models though, the split screen effects are really very good. Moon may not be the perfect film that some viewers have seen, but this should not be taken as a criticism because it is still a very good, low budget sci-fi. It doesn't totally delivery in the keys areas of plot and character but, even as it falls short of what could have been, it still delivers enough in the way of intelligence, thoughtfulness, silent tension and plot to make it a very good little sci-fi that is well worth seeing if you get the chance. Or, to put it another way, a choice between this and GI Joe ids no choice at all from my point of view!",,bob the moo,2009/08/20,9,5
653,Spider-Man 2,The Best Comic Book Movie. Ever!,"This movie is by far one of the best movies of all time! The movie had pretty much everything you need for a prefect film: Script: 10/10! OUTSTANDING! Director Sam Raimi did an excellent job giving full attention to the Dilemma of Peter Parker. He balances all the action, comedy, and drama perfectly. Acting: 10/10. Tobey Maguire was very good being a character that doubts himself and has to choose between wanting a normal life and wanting to live as a superhero. Kirsten Dunst is very good in her roll as Mary Jane Watson. James Franco is amazing as the bitter Harry Osborn who is seeking revenge on Spider-Man. And Alfred Molina as Doc Ock is fantastic. He was an excellent choice as one of my favorite characters from the comic. Action Sequences: 10/10. This movie has some amazing action scenes with Doc Ock on the building. But the best effect in the film is the fight between Spidey and Doc Ock on the side of the train. Comedy: 8/10. J.K. Simmons is amazing as J. Jonah Jameson and adds a lot to the film. Ted Raimi is also very funny. The Raindrops sequence in the movie had a lot of laughs when you see Peter Parker as the nerdiest kid in the world. This movie has everything you could ever want out of a summer blockbuster. And as far as staying faithful to the comic book 10/10. PERFECT!!! 10/10",10.0,wwalter1959,2007/11/01,49,38
654,Blackfish,The best horror film of the year.,"People have accused the film of being one sided. Well, considering that Sea World declined to be interviewed for the film, it is kind of hard for the filmmakers to be balanced. And the main character is unable to speak for himself. A previous reviewer stated that this film will not win any Oscars but it is eligible for the best documentary Oscar and CNN which aired it on it's network is increasing it's visibility. Tilikum, a 12,000 pound orca who is responsible for 3 deaths over 20 years is the main focus of the film. I had the pleasure 20 years ago while whale watching off the coast of Orange County, California of encountering 2 wild orcas. This was pure happenstance, we were looking for the Grey whale. Seeing these magnificent creatures in their natural habitat with the erect dorsal fin standing as tall as a man was a humbling experience. But in captivity you are stifling the animals natural instincts, You can't deny 65 million years of evolution. If the film does win the Oscar and I predict it will, hopefully it will change peoples views and be a force for change. This is one of the best films of the year documentary or otherwise.Update 2015-Sea World saw a drop on attendance at all of it's parks after the release of the film. A number of Rock and Roll artists cancelled performance at the parks in protest. In November of 2015 Sea World announce plans to end Orca shows at it's San Diego park. So the film has had a substantial impact. It is probably one of the most influential documentaries in history. It is more relevant now in light of these recent event.",,countvonbarron,2013/10/25,18,14
655,Ferris Bueller's Day Off,Really funny!,"""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" is the funniest 80's movie EVER! I can list some reasons why I liked this movie so much. 1. Matthew Broderick brings such joy to us playing Ferries Bueller, a character no one would hate. Ferris NEVER gets caught, is an expert at fooling his parents, everybody likes him, and nobody can avoid his favor and all. I want to be just like him! 2. Cameron, a geek friend of Ferris, is someone that portrays everybody's weakness. He is afraid of his parents, negative, and also very sensitive of his father's favorite car. This actor who plays Cameron was very, very good. 3. The principal who tries to prove that Ferris is not innocent and also kind of jealous of Ferris, is the most hilarious character in this movie. He sorta reminds me of my principal at High School. 4. Jennifer Grey plays Ferris's annoyed sister. She was great, and her bad attitude was somewhat hilarious. 5. Charlie Sheen's cameo of a guy in police station was absolutely funny. 6. This is John Hugh's BEST flick ever. 7. Mia Sara was sweet, she played Ferris's pretty girlfriend. 8. The most memorable scene was ""Twist and Shout"" scene, where all people dance in this song with Ferris lip-synching. 9. Cameron's speechless and hopeless stare was excellent. 10. After watching this movie, I am planning to take a Day-Off of my own! Overall, I give A+ for being the best teenage movie.",9.0,simeon-james,2012/03/23,3,2
656,The Green Mile,Right next to Shawshank!!!,Frank Darabont directs another masterpiece adapted by a Steven King novel.Sheer brilliance at its finest.Tom Hanks makes perhaps his greatest performance as the corrections officer Paul Edgecombe who doesn't believe in miracles until he sees one.While Tom and the others all shine in their roles I think that Michael Clarke Duncan deserves most credit as his magnificent portrayal of John Coffey-a convicted 8 foot tall giant murderer.He is accused in the killing of two little girls and sentenced to death.With time however Paul starts to wonder if the gentle hearted Coffey really did commit the murder.The movie has so many emotional moments that it's hard not to sympathize with the characters.The deep emotional drama of some of them is mentally pressuring and you become connected with these people - again expertly accomplished by Darabont who perfectly understands the source material and sticks close to it.Like Shawshank before it the movie teaches us the value of human life and how strong each one of us can be.This is achieved here similarly as again there is an innocent man put in prison but unlike Andy John is touched by God.He is a magical being who calls forth sympathy and by the end the audience is so аttached to him that the somewhat tragic ending is quite sad.As his previous movie Mr Darabont creates yet another fantastic film sure to stay in your heart for a while.Steven King should be proud.,9.0,stallone-9,2008/03/29,11,8
657,Ferris Bueller's Day Off,One of the Most Successful Movies of all time,"First order of business, Rest in Peace Mr. John Hughes as of yesterday which was Thursday August 6, 2009. He made some of the greatest coming of age comedies and dramas of all time. Now on to the business, Ferris Bueller's Day Off. This very successful 80's comedy stars the very entertaining Matthew Broderick. The movie is really just a simply entertaining and excellent concept. Ferris is trying to play his parents for yet another absence this year. He finds himself once again home from school, so he calls up his best friend Cameron and they pick up his girlfriend Sloane from school. Following this Ferris has probably the best day of his life, all with the principal and his sister trying to bring him to justice. Honestly there is no reason to pick out the flaws in this movie, because the movie is just flat out entertaining and funny. So if you want to see a film that will not disappoint then I suggest you check out Ferris Bueller's Day Off, it lives up to its reputation as a classic. 10/10",10.0,jts0405,2009/08/07,9,6

659,Blackfish,Heartbreaking,"Filmmaker Gabriela Cowperthwaite presents this heartbreaking one sided story revealing the cruelty mankind force upon yet another helpless animal, the orca. It reveals the only side that matters. The truth. Blackfish proves to me what other animal rights documentaries have countless times; that humans are the worst kind of animal. Take what they will, risk deaths of innocent lives for money and their own pleasure. Corporations and individuals included. Please remember that zoos, eating meat and animal by products, getting touristic photographs etc. are just as bad!!!!! Most people will watch this and still not change one thing in their lives, but please sit down and have a real think about this and have compassion for other living beings! Or if not watch Earthlings or Cowspiracy. It's what many people have needed to see to turn vegetarian/vegan. We can blame lack of education but even once educated with more knowledge, people will still continue to turn a blind eye. More emotional documentaries like Blackfish need to be crafted in such a wife in hope more people will be willing to make a change. to exist. And more people need to",9.0,karalong,2016/08/12,3,3
660,Taxi Driver,A Masterpiece,"Taxi Driver (1976) **** (out of 4) Scorsese's masterpiece is a raw, powerful and nerve wrecking look at depression and loneliness. The film centers on taxi driver Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro), a man clearly with his own demons who finds a purpose in life when he meets a 12-year-old hooker (Jodie Foster) who he plans on saving from her pimp (Harvey Keitel). To me this is one of the richest films ever made and it's one that can easily be overlooked in some circles if you don't really connect to what the film is trying to say. I didn't care too much for the movie the first few times I watched it because I was too young to really understand depression and loneliness. After I understood what those things could do to a person is when I fully became aware of the power in this film and today it remains one of the most powerful films ever made. To me the entire film is pretty much about Travis trying to find someone to fit in with but of course it never really happens until he meets the hooker. He tries fitting in with the Cybill Shepherd character but falls flat on his face. He tries fitting in with his co-workers but that doesn't work out too well. No matter what Travis tries he keeps ending up alone and as he put it, he's God's lonely man. This film works on so many levels but I think the psychological one is where it's best at. Getting us into the mind of Travis works for many reasons but the biggest keys are the direction by Scorsese, the brilliant music score by Bernard Herrmann and DeNiro's groundbreaking performance. Putting those three things together is what makes this a classic but we can also throw in the screenplay by Paul Schrader, which rightfully gives the movie the time and patience to let the Travis character grow right in front of our eyes. DeNiro's performance is certainly one for the ages, although I think he would get even better with Scorsese's RAGING BULL, which would follow in four years. His performance here is nothing short of amazing because you can't help but be terrified by this guy because of the look in DeNiro's eyes. You can't help but feel sorry for him at the same time because there are countless moments where he embarrasses himself because he simply doesn't know how to fit in. The word anti-hero gets used a lot and perhaps that's a good term but I think it's something much deeper than that. DeNiro hits all the right marks without a false note anywhere. Foster is also impressive in her few scenes in the film as is Keitel as the pimp. Shepherd is also good as his Albert Brookes and the underrated Peter Boyle who has one of the best scenes in the movie where he's trying to talk some sense into Travis. The visual look of the film is mighty impressive and Scorsese's directing style is nothing short of amazing. The slimy looking streets and the dark atmosphere are one of a kind and something many films tried to copy but could never get it as perfect as it is here. This here remains one of the greatest American films ever made and I'm really not sure any movie could top it in showing the effects that loneliness can have on a person.",,Michael_Elliott,2009/03/13,29,18
661,The Wailing,An accomplished occult thriller too open-ended for its own good,"Director Na, Hong-jin catapulted himself into the Korean directing elite with his much lauded debut movie, The Chaser, back in 2008. His follow-up, The Yellow Sea, received more tepid response, but there was little doubt that here was a movie-maker who had the potential to be spoken of in the same sentence as Bong Joon-ho and Park Chan-wook. His latest, The Wailing, starts with more than a passing resemblance to Bong's masterpiece, Memories of Murder. There's a series of grisly, unexplained murders in a backward-looking (although in The Wailing's case contemporary) countryside, which is then investigated by ordinary cops – more put-upon locals in uniform than law enforcers – increasingly out of their depth. What appears first as simple murders of passion begins to spread across the village, while an increasing number of people fall victim to a violent – and violence-inducing – fever, including the young daughter of one of the policemen on the case, Jong- gu. A portly every-man and a doting father, he is bewildered by the severity of the crimes (especially so in a hitherto tranquil countryside) and heart-broken by his daughter's sudden affliction. Desperate to find a cure, Jong-gu (played by Kwak, Do-won, a Na alumnus from Yellow Sea) and his friends latch onto the fact that the fever seemingly started after an unknown Japanese man appeared in the area. The more they delve into the stranger (Jun Kunimura, best known for getting decapitated by Lucy Liu in Kill Bill), the more Jong-gu realizes that the situation may belong more in the realms of the unnatural. Enlisting the help of a charismatic shaman, Jong-gu goes to the extremes to find a solution. Fittingly for the fishing motif that's so prevalent in the film, however, the more he bites at the problem, the more he seems to be ensnared. It's been a while since a Korean film had this kind of craftsmanship and artistic control to match its ambition. In many ways The Wailing is the true successor to the class of 2003 – when A Tale of Two Sisters and Oldboy as well as the aforementioned Memories of Murder were released – with how confidently the visuals are displayed, the themes are interwoven, and the story unfolds. The forebodingly beautiful cinematography nods at Kubrick, the acting is exemplary (including a worryingly remarkable turn from the child actress Kim, Hwan-hee as Jong-gu's daughter), and most of all the atmosphere of escalating horror that Na captures is impressively unsavoury indeed. The film is a bold departure (or throwback, depending on how you look at it) for Korean cinema in its heavy emphasis on the occult, a theme more associated in the country with the well-worn moralism of its ghost stories and the oft-parodied rituals of harlequin-esque shamans. At well over two and a half hours, The Wailing is a hefty movie, but with its potent mixture of procedural mystery, black comedy and a prevailing sense of dread, it commands attention masterfully for much of the duration. The one drawback for the film is a significant one that takes the shine off what could otherwise have been a landmark movie. During the course of the film Na throws a number of questions and macguffins up in the air. Who or what is causing the fever? Can the shaman be trusted? Is the Japanese stranger a victim of xenophobia? Who is the nameless girl always hovering around the crime scenes? Or is it all just collective hallucination caused by bad mushrooms? The Wailing takes its twists and turns, apparently answering the questions and overturning expectations. But then it keeps going, reopening closed plot strands and even downright contradicting itself on occasions. It soon becomes apparent that Na isn't so much interested in telling a self-contained story than an exercise in audience-baiting. All of the elements in the film which were so compelling and enjoyable are not allowed to coalesce together in the end, and the actions and motives of the major characters – the Japanese man, Jong-gu and his daughter, the shaman, the nameless girl – are ultimately rendered disparate, abstract and illogical. The ending is neither closed nor open-ended, but rather wilfully indeterminate, and it's tempting to think that Na is applying the film's fishing motif to the audience. Whether it's an appropriately auteur thing to do, or a self-defeating display of directorial indulgence, is perhaps best left to the individual viewer to decide.",7.0,kjihwan,2016/09/17,111,75
662,Interstellar,Poor in almost every possible way.,"Yesterday I watched the movie ""Interstellar"". A poorly scripted and poorly directed movie with an over-simplified pseudo-science and spoon-fed philosophical implications, basically a typically overrated Hollywood movie which takes no shame in copying from 2001: A Space Odyssey from Kubrick with none of its beauty, simplicity and none of its art. It shows that in 1968 they were able to make a masterpiece and in 2014 they can't even copy it decently.

663,Goodfellas,A classic mobster film.,"This is one hell of a film about the mobsters, based on a true story and coming from one of the great directors of all time. This is about Henry Hill, the narrator of the story, an Irish simple person who gets involved with the Mafia at a very young age and continues his life through it. There is no major plot in this film, just isolated incidents one of which was the turning point of Hill's life. Scorsese, as brilliant as he ever was, shows violence, sex and drugs etc in his own trademark style. And his actors helps him to make this film one of the classics. Robert DeNiro is not present in much of the film, nor his acting leaves too much impression. The three actors who really did their best job here are Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci and Lorraine Bracco. I hate to say that most youngsters today don't know too much about Liotta or how talented he was. I asked my younger brother about him and he said, ""The man who did the voice on GTA: Vice City?"". This is partly because Liotta did not get too many big roles after that, especially in recent years. But here he is just brilliant as Hill. It's Pesci's one of the best too. Playing a mad mobster with dark sense of humor wasn't his usual type. And Lorraine Bracco becomes the perfect lead female in such type of films. The film's got smart screenplay and excellent cinematography. And I don't know how many times Scorsese will be denied his Academy recognition. I hate to see a lifetime achievement award as his first Oscar. But things are going like that.",8.0,shanfloyd,2005/03/29,234,128
664,Intermission,"Interesting outlook, decent performances... but the film itself should have been better.","The movie follows parallel story lines of some random characters with different tastes, ambitions and perspectives. And in the end shows how each of their actions made them interconnected. Told in a very interesting satirical outlook towards life and society, the film does a decent job to provide unprecedented surprises especially in the end. But the film was supposed to be realistic in its approach. During the first hour-and-half it embraced realism, but it also grew boring. Towards the end, it abandons the idea to get entertaining. This dilemma in writing the screenplay perhaps weakened the basic plot and the movie lost its focus. It did deliver its entertaining and surprise-filled climax but I did not exactly want that clichéd approach of film-making especially when the movie started with a promise to be something different. The actors did a fine job altogether, especially the always-interesting Cillian Murphy and Kelly Macdonald. Colin Farrell did not have enough screen time and script to explore his expertise, so I do not see the point of casting him for this supposedly 'starring' role.",6.0,shanfloyd,2006/04/20,10,5
665,Blackfish,A Real Eye-Opener,"Blackfish is a film directed by Gabriela Cowperthwaite, and centres around Killer Whale (Orca) Tilikum, who was responsible for the death of 3 people. The film explores the idea about how these deaths caused by Tilikum aren't necessarily random events where the Orca loses control and turns aggressive against his trainer, but events in which could have been predicted quite easily. Blackfish certainly reminds me of a recent documentary, The Cove, that covers the Japanese mistreatment, slaughter of innocent dolphins. Both films have, sort of, the same message; these animals we're keeping and hurting, they are intelligent beings and they deserve to roam the wild oceans in peace. Blackfish accomplishes this message, and much more, to create a difficult but very satisfying watch. I should start with the footage. It's incredible what Gabriela Cowperthwaite has managed to gather. Footage that dates back to 1983, that is in great quality, really took my breath away. A lot of this footage is really spectacular, showing both wild Orcas roaming, and the desperate, captive Orcas. Not only do we have montages of these animals performing and swimming, but we also get to witness many of the attacks that took place, by not only Tilikum, but by a range of different Orcas. It really does take you by surprise when you get to witness first hand, the attacks that very well ended people's lives. Blackfish is certainly uncomfortable, and not an average watch. This is something that will open your eyes to the corporate world, and hopefully change your opinion on whether or not wild, large, beautiful animals should be kept in captivity for our entertainment. Some may call this propaganda; I feel that they are mistaken. Blackfish is a really brilliant documentary that should be a must watch for anyone, and everyone. 10/10",9.0,Callum_Hofler,2014/01/02,13,11
666,Hotel Transylvania,Let the child in you enjoy this adventure,"Cute movie. Has a couple of great messages -- especially one about prejudices. There are some adult jokes, some childish jokes, lots of laugh out loud moments but most importantly the following messages: Hatred against those we don't know is wrong; Let yourself get to know a person before deciding whether they are good or not; and go along for the ride and let yourself enjoy life. I also love the fact that this is a Dad raising his child situation. There are really few movies that show a Dad can step up and do the right thing for their children if given the chance. While I didn't particularly care for the fart joke or some of the childish parts the kids in the theater laughed and laughed. Well done!",8.0,jancr57,2012/09/28,126,94
667,Primal Fear,Wow...,"*Yes, there really are spoilers!* I thought 'Primal Fear' was going great when the first little twist hit. I wasn't expecting it, and having that first fascinating twist sprung on me really made the movie just a little better. EdwardNorton's Aaron was an absolutely adorable altar boy with a Kentucky drawl and stutter that just made you love him more, and then he was Roy, angry, brash and violent. Let me back track a bit. Aaron's been accused of slaughtering a prominent Arch Bisoph (and it appears as though he really did it too). His lawyer, a money and fame loving sleaze with a gold tinted heart (played by Gere)originally took the case in hopes of getting his name plastered on even more magazines. However, now he's becoming emotionally involved with abused and exploited Aaron, who suffers from Multiple Personality Disorder. I don't even have words to express how much I liked this movie. The courtroom scenes weren't boring and drawn out and just when you think it's all resolved and justice has been done, 'Primal Fear' turns completely around and you are left thinking ""Oh my God... what the... AWESOME!"" I seriously urge Edward Norton fans, psychological thriller fans and film fans in general to rent (or buy) this film.",9.0,electronsexparty,2005/06/28,9,7
668,Hotel Transylvania,"Blah, Blah, Blah","What really bothers Dracula is the way he's imitated. The usual mimic goes something like, ""Hello, I'm Count Dracula"" followed by the inevitable (drawn out in the Bela Lugosi accent) ""blah, blah, blah."" Each of those words describe the film, which doesn't have a plot but more of a situation... Dracula's daughter Mavis is of-age and desires going amongst the humans. Drac's an overprotective dad and wants her to stay at home: in a giant mansion he's turned into a plush hotel for all the monsters of the world to relax. A human named Jonathan, in the form of a twenty-something hippie lughead, happens into the Hotel... which is really just a sprawling lobby with so many monsters mashed together not one of them stands out as funny or important. Mavis and Jonathan hit it off but Dracula gets to him first – and frantically masquerades the kid into monster form so his daughter won't know the difference. That about sums up this claustrophobic mess, but with a title like HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA it shouldn't be surprising most of the film takes place there. The only problem is: there's little more than that over-saturated lobby that gets really dull quick. Sandler, who's needed a hit for years, doesn't suck in doing Drac's voice, but Adam Samberg's Jonathan sounds like a deliberate imitation of an airhead college jerk you wouldn't want to spend a minute with, much less ninety – which feels more like an eternity. So if you want to have a real monster shindig, rent the Rankin/Bass stop-motion classic MAD MONSTER PARTY where the ghoulish inhabitants all have purpose.

672,Moon,Simply exceptional,"Having a slight (huge) obsession with space, I can't believe I hadn't heard of this film until browsing the movie store about a year ago -catching my eye because of Sam Rockwell. It is now on my 'never be the same again after watching this' list. Watching it home alone on a rainy dark afternoon, I experienced the full impact of the designed purpose of this film: to really FEEL the crushing yet silent extent of isolation and disconnection drowning Sam Bell. It was absolutely haunting. The sole location of storytelling being the Moon is pivotal for succeeding this, and seeing Sam exist only either surrounded by airtight walls, airtight vehicles or airtight suits brings an overwhelming feeling of sadness and a heightened awareness of your own surroundings. A short 5 second dream sequence Sam has, shows the camera sweep over the sleeping, peaceful forms of him and his wife, before zooming under the bed sheets to a distraught looking Sam clutching at, trying to grab hold of the bodies of himself and his love is truly one of soul piercing moments that depicts this. Sam Rockwell is sensational as Sam Bell, his performance is so effortless and kept me never knowing how he was going to behave with each new revelation. The first event of the film which sets things in motion is very intelligent and you are left with the feeling that something is not right, which progresses to what the hell is going on, before reaching - Oh My Dear Space Nuggets! And keeps you reeling until the final few and tense moments of the film. Sam makes you laugh and relate to, yet specific scenes at differing intervals will form a horrible lump in your throat and have you quietly sobbing thanks to the execution of Rockwell's impeccable timing and ability, particularly after the discovery of a certain hidden area of his moon base. Gerty, the Robot on base voiced by Kevin Spacey is amazing, having you wondering at times if his intent of 'I want to help you' is really what it seems. Yet even this mechanical character will bring on a tear or two toward the finish. The visual effects are strangely realistic, which really makes this harder ( in a good way) to experience as it is quite confronting. This film has no heavy action, fancy space guns, or otherworldly sinister beings, but is in many ways more satisfying - rather than having you fear what is out in the entities of space, it has you afraid of the doings of a place you call home.",9.0,landed_bell,2013/01/06,9,5

674,Intermission,"Sorry, sheep","Dublin. The producer of a small news segment about the people, Ben(O'Suilleabhain, toying with that edge) wants to do a show on cop and self-proclaimed hardass Jerry(Meaney, determined and volatile), who is harassing small-timer Lehiff(Farrell, playing to his strength as a charming bad boy), who thinks of a bigger scheme. He will need people for it, so he approaches bus driver Mick(O'Byrne, kind but needing money for the missus, or, more appropriately, her plans for new floors, a shed, and...), whose friend John(Murphy, nice but keeps his feelings bottled up) misses his ex Deirdre(MacDonald, sweet) who, get this, has already gotten together with Sam(McElhatton, defensive) who left his wife of 14 years for her, understandably making her a bit upset. Thus this weaves the people and story lines in with one another, often letting us spend just a little time with one situation, allowing it to be, as the film is, fairly fast-paced, effective in its establishing and developing of characters, plot and the dark, quirky and harsh comedy, and, in spite of everything being set up and paid off on, immensely surprising. Along the way, we explore the themes of relationships, job situation, money and happiness. The ingredients of life, right there! And it manages to mix in drama, and maintain its Irish roots and identity throughout. The occasional intercutting of mounting tensions in different locations is a great tool, and at no point do we lose interest or track of any of the connected tales. There is a lot of strong language, some bloody, violent and disturbing content and a little sexuality in this. The DVD comes with interesting interviews with crew(about 4 and a half minutes) and cast(7 and a half minutes) and trailers for The United States of Leland, The Butterfly Effect, Step on It, Monster, The Passion of The Christ, Sky Captain and the world of Tomorrow, Godsend and Inkasso. I recommend this to any fan of local flavor and the superb cast. 7/10",7.0,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,2013/12/30,0,0
675,The Chorus,'Music that soothes the savage beast...',"LES CHORISTES (THE CHORUS) is director Christophe Berratier's first foray into the realm of full-length films and his adaptation of the 1945 film LA CAGE AUX ROSSINGNOLS written by Georges Chaperot and René Wheeler serves to introduce his talents as a master storyteller well. This tale of how music can alter the lives of even most renegade of boys is warm, sensitive, and satisfying on every level. The story opens with the reunion of two men who were classmates at Fond de l'Etang, a boarding school for troubled boys in France in 1949. Pepinot (Didier Flammand) arrives at the door of consummate symphony conductor Pierre Morhange (Jacques Perrin) with a journal written by their beloved teacher Clement Mathieu, now dead, and the two read the journal, recalling their shared childhood experiences at Fond de l'Etang. 1949 and the Fond de l'Etang is a dreary jail-like, rundown place run by the cruel disciplinarian headmaster Rachin (François Berléand). Clément Mathieu (Gérard Jugnot) is an older, bald, failed musician who seeks employment as a prefect in the school and immediately is forced to confront the rigors of the school's harsh discipline with the still flagrantly wild boys. Mathieu slowly wins the confidence of his boys by standing up to the cruel Rachin and when he is near his wits' end as to how to transform his class, he hears a boy sing and decides to use his musical talent to change these boys' lives. Two of the chief problem children are the angry but vocally gifted Pierre Morhange (Jean-Baptiste Maunier) and Leclerc (Théodul Carré-Cassaigne) and Mathieu coaxes them into the inner circle of his newly developing chorus. The other child who is without talent but for whom Mathieu empathizes when the child waits every Saturday for someone to claim him at the gates is Pepinot (Maxence Perrin) who Mathieu assigns as his assistant chorus master! Through a series of incidents including the cruelty of Rachin, the appearance of Violette Morhange (Pierre's poor working mother who cannot afford to feed him), the success of the chorus in the eyes of the Countess (Carol Weiss) who acts as benefactor to the school, and some evil doings of the more difficult children, Mathieu's Chorus becomes a symbol for how problem children can bond in mutual need to the enrichment music provides. Rachin cannot tolerate Mathieu's success and fires him without allowing him to say a farewell to his beloved choristers. The manner in which this is portrayed is most touching and spiritually enriching and serves to resolve the mystery of Mathieu's departure to the adult Morhange and Pepinot as they finish the journal. Simple story, told before, but superbly acted and performed. The music is by Jean-Philippe Rameau with original songs by director Barratier and Bruno Coulais, all beautifully sung by Les Petits Chanteurs de Saint-Marc with young actor Jean-Baptiste Maunier singing his own solos. The cinematography is in the capable hands of Jean-Jacques Bouhon, Dominique Gentil, and Carlo Varini. In French with English subtitles. Highly recommended little jewel of a film!

676,Taxi Driver,Boring overrated movie,"*spoiler alert* Perhaps I missed something, but to my mind this was just a very boring movie. I totally couldn't identify with any of the characters. I think the taxi driver (Robert DeNiro) was just an uninteresting dumb, socially inapt guy who gets alienated from society. The more crazy he became, the less I understood why. You don't start playing with guns and shooting people, just because you see crime on the streets... Or perhaps you do, and slowly evolve into doing this, but then I would have liked to see him evolve emotionally. Instead we see a guy, uncapable of expressing his emotions and we are puzzled by what really goes on in his head. Furthermore it was unclear to me what message the movies was trying to convey... It was probably about how rotten society is and about how society can drive a man crazy, but was he a hero, a victim, or just part of this crazy society? I haven't got a clue. Anyway, this film didn't touch me emotionally whatsoever. I give it 4/10.",4.0,Sandalf1980,2003/10/24,26,12

678,Pulp Fiction,The masterpiece without a message,"One of the early scenes in ""Pulp Fiction"" features two hit-men discussing what a Big Mac is called in other countries. Their dialogue is witty and entertaining, and it's also disarming, because it makes these two thugs seem all too normal. If you didn't know better, you might assume these were regular guys having chit-chat on their way to work. Other than the comic payoff at the end of the scene, in which they use parts of this conversation to taunt their victims, their talk has no relevance to anything in the film, or to anything else, for that matter. Yet without such scenes, ""Pulp Fiction"" wouldn't be ""Pulp Fiction."" I get the sense that Tarantino put into the film whatever struck his fancy, and somehow the final product is not only coherent but wonderfully textured. It's no wonder that fans spend so much time debating what was in the suitcase, reading far more into the story than Tarantino probably intended. The film is so intricately structured, with so many astonishing details, many of which you won't pick up on the first viewing, that it seems to cry out for some deeper explanation. But there is no deeper explanation. ""Pulp Fiction,"" is, as the title indicates, purely an exercise in technique and style, albeit a brilliant and layered one. Containing numerous references to other films, it is like a great work of abstract art, or ""art about art."" It has all the characteristics we associate with great movies: fine writing, first-rate acting, unforgettable characters, and one of the most well-constructed narratives I've ever seen in a film. But to what end? The self-contained story does not seem to have bearing on anything but itself. The movie becomes a bit easier to understand once you realize that it's essentially a black comedy dressed up as a crime drama. Each of the three main story threads begins with a situation that could easily form the subplot of any standard gangster movie. But something always goes wrong, some small unexpected accident that causes the whole situation to come tumbling down, leading the increasingly desperate characters to absurd measures. Tarantino's originality stems from his ability to focus on small details and follow them where they lead, even if they move the story away from conventional plot developments. Perhaps no screenplay has ever found a better use for digressions. Indeed, the whole film seems to consist of digressions. No character ever says anything in a simple, straightforward manner. Jules could have simply told Yolanda, ""Be cool and no one's going to get hurt,"" which is just the type of line you'd find in a generic, run-of-the-mill action flick. Instead, he goes off on a tangent about what Fonzie is like. Tarantino savors every word of his characters, finding a potential wisecrack in every statement and infusing the dialogue with clever pop culture references. But the lines aren't just witty; they are full of intelligent observations about human behavior. Think of Mia's statement to Vincent, ""That's when you know you've found somebody special: when you can just shut the f--- up for a minute and comfortably enjoy the silence."" What is the movie's purpose exactly? I'm not sure, but it does deal a lot with the theme of power. Marsellus is the sort of character who looms over the entire film while being invisible most of the time. The whole point of the big date sequence, which happens to be my favorite section of the film, is the power that Marsellus has over his men without even being present. This power is what gets Vincent to act in ways you would not ordinarily expect from a dumb, stoned gangster faced with an attractive woman whose husband has gone away. The power theme also helps explain one of the more controversial aspects of the film, its liberal use of the N-word. In this film, the word isn't just used as an epithet to describe blacks: Jules, for instance, at one point applies the term to Vincent. It has more to do with power than with race. The powerful characters utter the word to express their dominance over weaker characters. Most of these gangsters are not racist in practice. Indeed, they are intermingled racially, and have achieved a level of equality that surpasses the habits of many law-abiding citizens in our society. They resort to racial epithets because it's a patter that establishes their separateness from the non-criminal world. There's a nice moral progression to the stories. We presume that Vincent hesitates to sleep with Mia out of fear rather than loyalty. Later, Butch's act of heroism could be motivated by honor, but we're never sure. The film ends, however, with Jules making a clear moral choice. Thus, the movie seems to be exploring whether violent outlaws can act other than for self-preservation. Still, it's hard to find much of a larger meaning tying together these eccentric set of stories. None of the stories are really ""about"" anything. They certainly are not about hit-men pontificating about burgers. Nor is the film really a satire or a farce, although it contains elements of both. At times, it feels like a tale that didn't need to be told, but for whatever reason this movie tells it and does a better job than most films of its kind, or of any other kind.",10.0,kylopod,2005/11/17,2190,1892
679,Hotel Transylvania,"A waste of a dynamic, gorgeous animated film","When I first heard about this project, I was excited. How could I not be? I've been a monster fan since I was able to be a fan of things, and have enjoyed Genndy Tartakovsky since my very first exposure to his vivid, highly-stylised work. Then came the bad news: the voice cast. Upon seeing that not only Adam Sandler, but also David Spade, Kevin James, Fran Drescher and Selena Gomez were attached, my heart sank. What was this? The worst, most pandering cast they could find? So, I decided I could skip this one, Tartakovsky or not. The film showed at our local theatre, and I let the wife and daughter go with friends and without me. They came back pretty pleased, but not excited enough to make me feel like I'd missed anything. So, I waited for it to come out on home video. Having finally gotten to see it, all my expectations have been confirmed: the film was fantastic to look at, with animation more full of animated life (as opposed to 'real' life, a la most computer-animated films) than I've seen in...maybe ever; the voice cast was awful. It's an entertaining premise (though one I feel has been visited before), and one that has the potential to gather together great monsters in a human-free environment to unwind and show us their 'true' personalities. That much was realised, but only as far as the voice talent could take it. Sandler's Dracula was lackluster and as empty as his performances tend to be. Most of the rest of the cast could have been anyone, really. Even their heaviest hitter talent-wise, Steve Buscemi, was so underplayed as to be non-existent. And Samberg's character, the sole human in the story? Oof. Could they have made him sympathetic to anyone but the most obnoxious late-teen douchebags? And I'm not even going to touch the non-Mothersbaugh soundtrack. Though, to paraphrase the young son of an eminent animation man: movies always end with dancing anymore. Okay, I know that cranky geeks in their 40s are not the target audience for this movie. But maybe it should have been. Clearly, they weren't going to get the Twilight crowd, and the movie was a little too light-hearted for the Twilight-lash-back crowd. Outside of that, who was going to see this movie and actually care what was on the screen in front of them? Monster fans and animation freaks! While neither of those are likely to be completely let down by Hotel Transylvania, I doubt this is one of which any audience is going to need repeat viewings. Except, perhaps, with the sound off.",6.0,aliceboy,2013/03/08,6,3
680,Detachment,No insight to be found here,"I had high hopes about this film, but it left me feeling annoyed. First, the positive. The cinematography is attractive and the scenes are well constructed visually. If you are looking for open-ended existential questions, you will find a few of those. If you are looking for Adrian Brody to do his sad eyebrow face, you will not be disappointed. There are a few cameos by other great actors, if you are in to that sort of thing. Now, the negative. This film does not offer any valuable insight into any of the problems that it addresses. It gives a sensationalist portrayal of the difficulty of being a teacher in a failing school, the apathy of students and teachers, and the aftermath of childhood abuse. It emphasizes each of these problems without offering any kind of understanding beyond the expression of listless angst. All the vague statements that Adrian Brody says into the camera are certainly less than the sum of their parts. I don't expect all films to offer insight. When the subject matter are issues that people care deeply about, it is nice, but if a film doesn't offer insight at least it can offer entertainment. Well, not this one. The story is aimless and meandering. The child actors are not believable. Instead of watching this movie you might consider just sitting in a corner to think about how bad life can be, and then blame it all on parents without really trying to understand the situation.

Set in a time where there is no real recourse to justice for such men and with a subplot that becomes the main focus of the film.

Sensibly eschewing the wholesale teenage angst of many of his other pre-adult films, Hughes just focuses wholly on comedy tinged with a liberal dose of gentle satire, which is generally manifested in a continuous Mickey-taking of adult behaviour. In Ferris's world adults don't understand the teenagers in their care, be it Ferris's parents or the high school principal Mr Noonan, who makes it his mission in life to catch Ferris in the act of doing something he shouldn't be doing. His litany of comedic failures contrast markedly with Ferris's success in doing all the things in just one epic day off school, that many of us might not have the nerve to do in a lifetime. He is aided and accompanied in his adventures with girlfriend Sloane and best pal Cameron. The casting is perfect with Matthew Broderick excelling as the exuberant, witty hero in what is undoubtedly his most famous role. Not to be outshone though is Alan Ruck in what is arguably his most beloved role as the also talented, but far less self-confident Cameron. Amazingly, the near 30 year old Ruck convincingly looks the part. Mia Sara is suitably elegant as Sloane, whilst Jeffrey Jones uproariously and inevitably plays the hapless coyote, to Ferris's always superior road runner. One cannot look past Jennifer Grey either, as Ferris's bitter but attractive younger sister, Jeanie. Both Charlie Sheehan's (police station) and Ben Stein's (form teacher) cameos are not to be missed by anyone ... anyone? The Windy City of Chicago plays its extremely functional part in all of its late spring (actually early autumn) glory. Memorable side trips include the observation deck of Sears Tower, Wrigley Field, the Chicago Art Institute and the stand out Von Steuben's Day Parade where the famous lip-sync of Twist and Shout occurs with a good deal of both improvised and choreographed dancing among the crowd. Hughes's decision to have his lead character frequently break the fourth wall was a winner, as were the many striking camera angles used and the music selected for the soundtrack. John Hughes passed away far too early. But in Ferris Bueller's Day Off, he left a lasting legacy full of cross-generational appeal. It's a classic!",10.0,spookyrat1,2019/01/12,9,5
686,Detachment,different tastes I guess...,"Wow. I don't get the love this movie is getting here. I would argue that the Rotten Tomato reviews are more objective. Just my opinion- The trouble with this movie for me was the screenplay; the dialogue and characters are just not believable. The sudden outbursts, the random conversations- they were just bizarre. Oral sex on the bus, spitting on, and threatening a teacher without repercussions. It all lacked reality. The random animations, direct to camera speaking, and shaky camcorder feel didn't help. Watch Season 4 of the Wire if you want to see powerful, yet accurate, character portrayal and dialogue associated with this topic.This just seemed forced, in-your-face, and came across as trite. Again, just my opinion.",1.0,gouellette-390-286399,2012/08/16,50,25
687,Crash,Grossly overrated,"Given this film's incredible reviews I was expecting something truly exceptional. It certainly starts well with witty and sharp dialogue, and a fine cast in place. A series of Robert Altman-style interwoven stories reel the viewer in with some compelling scenes. I found it gripping entertainment right through to the second half of the film when sadly, it collapses like a pack of cards. A series of ludicrous coincidences and right-on messages stack up until I'm left deeply disappointed and wondering what all the fuss is about. Paul Haggis has tackled the subject of race in LA, and that alone seems to have elevated this movie to a new level of interest. Given that most of the Academy voters live in LA and have experienced racism to some extent, this film is sure to have an impact on them. That means the Oscar for Best Picture will go to the race movie or the gay movie. Let's hope it is the latter, because Brokeback Mountain is a bona fide masterpiece that deserves recognition.",3.0,paulcarm,2006/02/01,61,37
688,Hotel Transylvania,"""I vant to suck your blood!!""","What is it with most modern animations, when all the cast have to end the film by embarking on an embarrassing song & dance routine? It was entertaining in Shrek, but more than a decade on the sight of various individuals shaking their stuff and caterwauling into a microphone to 'popular hits' has worn thinner than Kate Moss. Stop it. Now. Aside from that misstep, this is a fun frolic in a world full of the most harmless monsters you're ever likely to encounter. Sure, they're ugly and have weird habits, but they wouldn't hurt a fly (In fact some of them ARE giant flies) and all they want to do is live their lives in peace. They stay away from humans, who they believe are nasty, vicious uncivilised creatures who'll kill you as soon as look at you (Not entirely inaccurate down my neck of the woods). An unrecognisable Adam Sandler plays Dracula, whose cute teenage (118 years old) daughter falls in love with a mortal... much to his disapproval. Much of the rest of the film is about him trying to keep the lovebirds apart, and the usual assortment of gross-out gags and freaky goings-on. Of course, he has a change of heart near the end, and all the stuff about feeling a ZING when you meet the one you want to spend eternity with is just cloying nonsense ( Especially when the girl's objet d'affection is a witless red-haired surfer dude) But there's more than enough fun here for both kids and adults to make it worthwhile, as the writer makes the most out of an inventive premise with more jests about The Invisible Man, Frankenstein, The Mummy etc than you ever though possible. Trust me, this is quite a feat. 6/10",6.0,natashabowiepinky,2013/06/30,3,2
689,Intermission,Quite Funny! 5/10,"Review: I loved the beginning of this movie. Colin Farrell's character was excellent in this film but its a shame that he isn't in it more. There's many different stories to follow which all come together during the end. The director done well to mix up the comedy with a romance undertone, but it all looked like it was who on the cheap. Whilst watching the movie, I was wondering were the hell the director was going to go with the plot, but when it all comes together it turns out to be quite funny. All of the actors out in good performances, but its Farrell's character that stands out from the rest. In all, its a decent watch with many twists and turns. Watchable! Round-Up: Judging by the budget, I thought that the director done well with putting this project together. You don't actually realise how much ground it covers until the end of the movie when you piece it all together. I didn't really know what to expect before I watched the movie, which was why I enjoyed it more. You will definitely find something in this movie that will make you laugh. Budget: $5million Worldwide Gross: $4.8million I recommend this movie to people who are into there Irish comedies with a bit of something for everyone. 5/10",5.0,leonblackwood,2013/09/15,0,0
690,Hotel Transylvania,A wild and zany animated movie.,"The name Genndy Tartakovsky is a name that most animation fans will appreciate and even if you haven't heard of him, you probably have heard of the shows he created at Cartoon Network like ""Dexter's Laboratory"" and ""Samurai Jack"". The name Adam Sandler on the other hand, is not a name most film fans will appreciate. This was the man who did bring us some of the worst comedies ever made like ""Jack and Jill"" as well as create ""Eight Crazy Nights"" which despite it's grand and glorious animation is one of the worst animated movies ever made. Seeing the two team up is a little odd, though that's what they did with the help of Sony Pictures Animation which resulted in the movie ""Hotel Transylvania"", a film that has gotten an interesting reaction from both critics and audiences a like. Where the critics hated this movie, audiences seem to like it. As for me, I think it's decent. Is it a terrible and childish movie? No. So, is it a modern Halloween classic? Also no. I'll get into why in a minute, but first let me sum up the plot. Count Dracula (Adam Sandler) has built a hotel for all monsters to go to relax and go on vacation away from ""evil humans"" as well as keeping his only daughter Mavis (Selena Gomez) safe after his wife Martha was killed by the humans years ago. With her 118th birthday approaching, Mavis is curious about the human world and wants to explore it though her father is still reluctant and wants to keep her safe. However, things go upside down for Dracula when a human tourist named Jonathan (Andy Samberg) accidentally stumbles into the hotel. Wanting to keep the guest from being scared, Dracula disguises Jonathan as a sort of Frankenstein monster and only gets into a bigger sticky situation when Mavis starts to develop romantic feelings for Jonathan. What happens next are lots of crazy shenanigans and fast paced humor that explaining the whole story would be too much so I'll just leave it there and get to my thoughts. This is certainly a very creative film. The idea of monsters staying at a hotel away from humans is a very clever and unique plot which does lead to some creative jokes and fast paced humor, though the film does have moments to let the audience catch their breath with some pretty effective slower moments. The scene where Dracula tells an emotional backstory in the film was actually surprisingly really well handled which is something I was really impressed with by the film. As for the animation, if you want crazy, zany fast paced animation, here it is. This film really knows how to do fast paced animation well which really reminded me of the old cartoons from 40's and 50's or even that Baby Herman short at the beginning of ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" yet it does bring me to a small criticism. Though the film worked well in computer animation, it would have really shined had it been hand drawn. These character designs seemed to be made to be drawn by a pencil and not by pixels and it was even clearly proved during the end credits where we see 2D versions of the characters. It's nothing too major, but I feel that seeing it being done traditionally would have been a major plus for this film. Most of the jokes really work. Even though it is kind of juvenile at times particularly in the opening, this film did have some good laughs including a scene that took a stab at ""Twilight"". Yeah, I have to give credit to this movie. They really made a great anti-Twilight joke. Now how are the characters, particularly Adam Sandler as Count Dracula? Actually, they're mostly fun. I was a little nervous when I first heard the casting of Sandler as Dracula, but he managed to really pull off the character and his voice actually mostly unrecognizable. Even the other monsters in the film work. I think the funniest monster is Eunice who's the Bride of Frankenstein. Having her always push her poor husband around did make me chuckle a lot not to mention having her played by Fran Drescher was also an ideal choice. There are things that I didn't like about the movie, most notably the soundtrack. Man, this is one dated soundtrack. Although Mark Mothersbaugh's score is pretty good, the songs sounded like they came from an eight year old's kid's iPod from 2012. The autotune also really got on my nerves and having to listen to these terrible pop songs just irritated me. So while I don't think ""Hotel Transylvania"" is a great movie by any means, I certainly don't think it's as bad as what other critics have said. It does have a creative story, the animation is really fast paced and enjoyable (even though it would've been better hand drawn) and the characters did have some funny things to them. In my opinion, this movie seems to be suited as a fun silly movie to throw on during a party and that's it. I think it's good for a one time watch, but really it's not much of a classic.",7.0,Animated_Antic,2018/07/03,3,3

692,October Sky,"Wonderful, if not too ideal.","I'm sure things didn't exactly go the same way in the real life of Homer Hickam as they did in the film adaptation of his book, Rocket Boys, but the movie ""October Sky"" (an anagram of the book's title) is good enough to stand alone. I have not read Hickam's memoirs, but I am still able to enjoy and understand their film adaptation. The film, directed by Joe Johnston and written by Lewis Colick, records the story of teenager Homer Hickam (Jake Gyllenhaal), beginning in October of 1957. It opens with the sound of a radio broadcast, bringing news of the Russian satellite Sputnik, the first artificial satellite in orbit. We see a images of a blue-gray town and its people: mostly miners working for the Olga Coal Company. One of the miners listens to the news on a hand-held radio as he enters the elevator shaft, but the signal is lost as he disappears into the darkness, losing sight of the starry sky above him. A melancholy violin tune fades with this image. We then get a jolt of Elvis on a car radio as words on the screen inform us of the setting: October 5, 1957, Coalwood, West Virginia. Homer and his buddies, Roy Lee Cook (William Lee Scott) and Sherman O'Dell (Chad Lindberg), are talking about football tryouts. Football scholarships are the only way out of the town, and working in the mines, for these boys. ""Why are the jocks the only ones who get to go to college,"" questions Homer. Roy Lee replies, ""They're also the only ones who get the girls."" Homer doesn't make it in football like his older brother, so he is destined for the mines, and to follow in his father's footsteps as mine foreman. Until he sees the dot of light streaking across the October sky. Then he wants to build a rocket. ""I want to go into space,"" says Homer. After a disastrous attempt involving a primitive rocket and his mother's (Natalie Canerday) fence, Homer enlists the help of the nerdy Quentin Wilson (Chris Owen). Quentin asks Homer, ""What do you want to know about rockets?"" Homer quickly anwers, ""Everything."" His science teacher at Big Creek High School, Miss Frieda Riley (Laura Dern) greatly supports Homer, and the four boys work on building rockets in Homer's basement. His father, however, whose life is the mine, does not support him. John Hickam (Chris Cooper) believes that Homer shouldn't waste his time on the rockets, that the coal mines are all that matter. The coal from the mines is used to make steel, and without steel, the country would be nothing. The difficult relationship between Homer and his dad is one of the most poignant relationships I have ever seen in a film. Miss Riley introduces Homer to the idea of entering the local science fair, with a chance to go the nationals and win a college scholarship. ""You can't just dream your way out of Coalwood,"" she tells Homer. Homer and his friends act upon their dreams by working constantly on the rockets, improving the models with each attempt. Despite the many attempts, the boys do not lose their determination. ""What are the chances of us winning that science fair,"" O'Dell asks Homer in one of their more despairing moments. ""A million to one,"" answers Homer. ""That good?"" O'Dell replies, ""Well, why didn't you say so?"" The music, composed by Mark Isham, conveys sadness and hope at the same time, especially sad at a point when Homer descends into the mine shaft and loses sight of the sky and his dreams of getting out of Coalwood. Rollicking 1950s' rock and roll, including songs by The Coasters and Buddy Holly, occasionally pushes the instrumental pieces aside to create a light-hearted mood that contrasts the teenagers' lives with the lives of the miners. The film, photographed by Fred Murphy, also uses colors to set moods and symbolize. The town of Coalwood, actually filmed in Tennessee, is washed with blues, grays, and browns. It's as if the grime from the coal sticks to everything- faces, clothes, houses, and roads. When a couple in a gleaming red convertible stops to ask for directions from the boys, it is obvious that they are from the world outside of Coalwood and the Olga Coal Company. The book on guided missile design that Miss Riley gives Homer is red. The red stands out enough against the blue-gray world of Coalwood to symbolize ""getting out"", but it is still subtle. The reds are fleeting hints of a world that Homer only dreams of. Jake Gyllenhaal expresses such zeal, hope, and pertinacity as Homer Hickam that it is hard to believe he isn't the real Homer we see in actual footage at the end of the film. Chris Cooper is also extraordinarily believable as Homer's stubborn father, who doesn't recognize, or just doesn't want to admit, that the mine is not producing enough to keep the town alive. Homer, and everyone who encourages him in his rocket-building, is aware that the town is dying. With the community disintegrating, the only way they stay together is by gathering for the rocket boys' demonstrations. Again, I'm sure things didn't happen exactly as the movie portrayed them, but what would a movie be without a bit of idealism? ""October Sky"" has just enough of that to make it a great motion picture and enough rawness to keep it real.",10.0,bturtle_17,2001/08/15,1,1

694,Primal Fear,Watched it again for Norton,"The movie plot revolves around the brutal (In it's real sense, because it was truly brutal) murder of a highly regarded Chicago priest, an altar boy (19 years) who is caught as the suspect of murder, and a successful criminal lawyer who takes the boy's case to save him. The plot looks simple but it has tremendous under currents and one of them is the mental condition of the suspect. For almost half the movie, the director is able to convince the viewer that the boy may be innocent. But the finding that the boy himself has killed the priest because of his multiple personality disorder shocks everyone . Ya, the plot may remind you of the Akshay Khanna - Ajay Devgan starrer Deewangee . Certain scenes of this movie are brilliant especially the change in characters by the boy in a split second. Richard Gere as the Lawyer has played his part well. But the man who stole the show is Edward Norton who plays the mentally -ill boy charged with murder .

695,The Wailing,By far the best movie of the year,"''The Wailing'' is easily the best movie of the year 2016. It's at least the best Korean film since the vivid action-comedy flick ''Quick'' and the war epic ''My Way'' five years ago. It's on the same level as horror and thriller classics like ''Memories of Murder'', ''Oldboy'' and ''Sympathy for Mister Vengeance''. I would say that ''The Wailing'' is at least the most intense horror movie since the first part of the ''Insidious'' series six years earlier. Since this movie doesn't get a wider release in North American and European cinemas despite being a massive success at the South Korean box office, I urge you to buy it on BluRay or DVD as soon as you can to experience this unforgettable masterpiece. The story of this mystery and horror film takes place in a remote and rather poor Korean village where a series of strange events occurs. People seem to commit horrible crimes while being under the influence of what seems to be an abominable disease or a weird drug. People kill their own family members, friends or neighbors for no apparent reason by stabbing them to death or burning down their houses among other elements. Local police officer Jong-goo is scared and shocked by those horrible events but grimly determined to uncover the mystery behind those crimes. Despite being initially analytical, grounded and reluctant to investigate superstitious claims that those crimes are related to a mysterious Japanese shaman living in the woods and feasting on raw animal meat, Jong-goo feels more and more confused, haunted and helpless when he can't find any logical explanation for the series of gruesome crimes and confronts the mysterious stranger. Soon after this, Jong-goo own daughter seems to change as she is abnormally hungry, behaves strangely and reacts aggressively towards anyone who is approaching her. Jong-goo realizes that he must solve the mysterious incidents in his village as quickly as possible in order to save his daughter. There are many elements that make this movie so outstanding. One element is the sinister story itself that keeps the audience guessing until the end. Just like the main character, the audience quickly doesn't know what to believe in anymore and the haunting ending only adds to the brilliance of the movie. The movie's strongest key to success is probably its intense atmosphere. Most scenes take places during storms or heavy rainfall which adds to the tension of the film. The fitting locations include dark forests, dirty huts and empty highways. The slow and menacing pace of the movie will keep you on the edge of your seat as it is regularly interrupted by sudden graphic or sinister scenes that feel so shockingly realistic because they aren't exaggerated or overwhelming. A brooding soundtrack, fitting costumes and settings and sinister light techniques only increase the almost unbearably tense atmosphere. Despite an epic running time of more than two and a half hours, this film doesn't have any unnecessary lengths in my opinion. Another winning element is the incredibly detailed work by director Na Hong-jin. Each scene serves a specific character development, an increase of seemingly supernatural and stunning elements or a particular clue to involve the audience and let it put the pieces of the puzzle together. The movie took more than half a year to be made and it really pays off in the end. This film feels incredibly detailed, stunningly acted and perfectly produced. The actors and actresses are all giving the best performances of their lives. One has to point out main character Kwak Do-won who changes from a caring, determined and strong father to a desperate, helpless and impulsive shadow of its former self who is haunted by nightmares and tries to solve his problems in violent manners. It's easy for the audience to identify with this charismatic, emotional and realistic character from start to finish. The supporting actors are just as great because there are many mysteries revolving around them and you never really know whether they are good or bad or somewhere in between. Police officer Jong-goo meets a mysterious woman dressed in white who seems to give him clues to solve the strange murder cases and save his daughter but at certain points in the story, she seems strangely passive and might even try to fool the main character. Jong-goo also encounters a young shaman who seems helpful and powerful at first contact but whose scary rituals seem to harm the main character's daughter more than anything else. Obviously, there is the mysterious Japanese stranger who only communicates in his mother tongue and whose recent appearance in the remote Korean community evokes numerous questions. The combination of an extremely professional director, an intriguing script and story that requests multiple views, a cast consisting of young and veteran actors who put all their heart and soul into their performances, an intense yet realistic atmosphere supported by a haunting soundtrack, scary settings and costumes and gloomy light techniques and a great production that takes its time to develop a perfect pace without any flaws such as shaky cameras or unrealistic special effects make this film a masterpiece of the contemporary art of film-making. If you like mystery and horror movies, there is no way for you to get around this movie. If you were to miss out on this movie, you simply couldn't consider yourself an expert of these two genres anymore.

696,October Sky,Amazing Uplifting Period Piece,"October Sky tells the true story of Homer Hickam (Jake Gyllenhaal). He is a high school boy from a coal mining town in West Virginia. Unless you were able to get a football scholarship the chances of getting out of Coalwood were small. Homer does not fit the bill of a football player and refuses to become another miner. Instead he sets his sights on what's above the earth rather than below it. In the wake of the first Sputnik launch Homer decides to take up rocketry without the approval of his coal miner father John (Chris Cooper). This film is a small slice of life depicting the perseverance of Homer and his friends to make something of their lives. They receive little support from the majority of the town members who believe that there's not much else to life besides mining coal and playing football. October Sky takes the dreams of four high school boys and inspires those who believe that you can become something bigger than the life society deems for you. The screenplay is well written, the acting top notch, and the story is bigger than the setting. This small period piece is amazingly uplifting and can touch a wide audience. It is a family movie and is one that all can enjoy regardless of age. I first saw this film in theaters when I was eight. Over fifteen years later I still find this movie as inspirational as the first time I saw it. I keep it on my shelf under movies that will lift me up. It is simple but extraordinary at the same time. This little gem should be on everyones list to watch. I think it is a movie that will never be outdated and one that will stay with all those that have seen it.",10.0,darosslfc,2015/08/29,2,2

698,October Sky,"Inspirational, and true to life ...","After seeing this movie, I'm very surprised and disappointed on the negative comments already posted about this movie (albeit, only a few). I grew up in a town not far from Coalwood, but I no longer live anywhere near there for many of the same reasons Homer had for getting out of Coalwood. Although my years near there occurred later than Homer Hickam's, I can see so many things in common with his experience in Coalwood and my own growing up. When an earlier comment about his movie said that it was just another movie about adversity and overcoming odds, I don't think they quite understand the point. Homer Hickam grew up in a place that was far away from anything -- even the math book he needed for building the rockets had to be ordered because although it wasn't stated, I assume that at that time there was no library around that carried such a book. Just think about that for a moment. It's very difficult for young people in that area to see anything more in their lives than what they see outside their windows. I'm sure the same could be said for some urban kids who live in depressed areas. But, I would be less impressed with this story if Homer Hickam grew up in suburban New Jersey or urban Chicago, for example, where so much of the world is just a few minutes away and finding people to help you is so easy. Remember, Homer had to walk 8 miles just to leave coal company property, and the men at the coal company who supported him did so even though they risked losing their jobs (and there were no other jobs to be had). Luckily, Homer had a teacher who recognized a student with a dream and potential. Homer was a student in the middle of the pack (academically and socially) who dared to defy the odds. Even Quentin, the brain, needed Homer. In fact, one of the things that clearly separates this movie from so many other stories of achievement is that it was done academically. While sports achievements are great, why do so many movie makers shy away from other achievements? Many people in Coalwood didn't care too much for academic achievements, but tackle somebody on the football field and you are off to college. Too many people glamorize sports, and as time marches on we have more and more examples of exactly how unglamorous (and felonious) some sports figures are. It's impossible to compare a touchdown with a rocket going to the moon (at least aimed at it). Homer didn't make a touchdown, but if he had it would just mean a trip to Disneyworld. Instead, Homer built rockets and there is no end to where he can go except in his dreams. Truly, an inspirational movie!",10.0,johnscook,2001/02/10,1,1

Do not go into the theatre expecting an action packed cerebral thriller. This one is not for action fans. At times, movie go highly sentimental( Matthew McConaughey does what he is best in and supposed to). I recommend this movie to all the Sci-Fi fans out there, make sure you go in group of sci-fi nuts!! Do not go with the hype..Go, sit back and enjoy. Just like Inception, this movie will be known as great after few months(I know people who said Inception was a crap when it released, and after few months rating it 10/10 in IMDb :D). I don't wanna spoil anything(If you want PM me). Also, make sure you go to the best theatre close to you.

700,The Chorus,Uplifting! Puts a smile on your face! A wondrous breath of fresh air,"THE CHORUS (Les Choristes) (Christophe Barratier, France/Switzerland/Germany, 2004, 96 min.). Brilliantly crafted, absorbing tale of the transformative power of choral music and a resourceful teacher to achieve civility within the confines of a dreadful state lockup school for deviant and unwanted boys. The story is told in a long flashback, when a reunion occurs between two men who were in the school together a half century earlier. As their story is recounted, we first meet Clement Mathieu (Gerard Jugnot), a short, balding, failed musician who in middle age has no other prospects than to take a job as supervisor in the prison-like school, run by a sadistic martinet, Rachin (Francois Berleand), who treats his faculty as viciously as the students. The ensuing plot conceit is a familiar one: the steadfast Mathieu gradually wins over the insolent, anarchical kids through music and kindness, as he introduces a choir program to brighten the otherwise dull, steady diet of the three ""R's"" and the punishments meted out by Rachin. This little gem has been a surprise hit, wildly popular both in France and internationally. The choral numbers are sublime, performed by an established French boys' choir, whose soprano soloist, Jean-Baptiste Maunier, sings flawlessly and acts the role of young Pierre Morhange, a central figure among the youths here. The film is a remake of a 1945 movie, ""La Cage aux rossignols""  ""A Cage of Nightingales."" First time writer-director Christophe Barratier was himself a musician: beginning musical studies at age 7, he also sang in a boys' choir, and later studied at the Paris Conservatory. He is the nephew of Jacques Perrin, the well-known actor and film producer (""Microcosmos,"" ""Himalaya,"" ""Winged Migration""), who here plays the adult Pierre Morhange, now an internationally known conductor, one of the two men who meet at the start of this film to reflect on their experiences long ago. The story is not far fetched. I have personally known of situations in which participation in choral music turned around the lives of troubled teenagers. Amid so many films reflecting indifference, destitution and violence in our world, this one comes to us like a wondrous breath of fresh air. (In French). My rating: 8.5/10 (A-) (Seen on 04/16/05).

Maybe that was because those in front of the camera were pretty unsympathetic characters - though well portrayed by the excellent cast. Or maybe it was because the production was so self-conscious. It has no identity of it's own and just seems to draw on an established 'independent' film standard production style...which we've seen done to death - or maybe it was supposed to be ironic...if so, then that's all it was. I was left unmoved.",5.0,earthdan58,2003/12/03,21,10
703,Taxi Driver,A taxi ride you will never forget,"Taxi Driver is one of my all-time favorite movies. Each time I see it, I am absolutely amazed at De Niro's genius. Perhaps no other actor can better portray this, or most other characters, at least those that require a great deal of talent and the ability to really become the character. De Niro never fails to amaze, and Taxi Driver is far from being an exception. The main protagonist of the film, Travis Bickle, is an alienated, slightly psychotic Vietnam veteran-and NYC cab driver-who being absolutely disgusted with his surroundings (at night driving a cab through all parts of the city), takes it upon himself to save a very young prostitute, Iris,( played by Jodie Foster)from all the ""scum"" (recurrent theme)-and the life of a prostitute, including a pimp. He also falls in love with a woman who works on a political campaign for a fictional senator, Palantine. Although he fails to win her over, he does attempt to assassinate Palantine..perhaps he wants to be a hero, or to save his love interest from what he regards as a useless environment. The recurrent theme is clear throughout the film- Bickle attempts to help those with whom he becomes obsessed, from an environment that disgusts him. Paradoxically, however, the lonely, useless character becomes regarded as a hero, for going to great lengths to save the object of his obsession (Iris). Taxi Driver takes you through the mind and reasoning of a lonely, obsessive man, and his attempts to bring justice to those who ultimately do not understand or care for him.",10.0,ciao77,2007/10/02,15,9
704,Ferris Bueller's Day Off,Don't let school get in the way of your education....,"John Hughes does a tremendous job of portraying school as an oppressive prison in which children are forced into the most unnatural setting to memorize useless facts to ""get their grade."" _The Breakfast Club_ is another example of this, but FBDO does it tremendously well. The setting portrayed at the school of the bored students listening to a nasal monotone lecture, while intended to be a caricature of the nature of classroom lessons and children's reactions, was pretty much on target. Ferris Bueller takes the day off and what does he do? Certainly not what Rooney assumed smart teenagers will do. He didn't use this time to damage some bedsprings with his girlfriend, or play video games. No, he viewed fabulous pieces of art, ate at a very classy restaurant, participated in a parade, and taught his friends a few lessons in some interesting ways. As a believer in education as an organic experience, this movie is a real eye opener to anyone wishing to educate their children outside of the public school venue. It's funny, and shows just how worthy time ""living your life before it passes by"" can be. 10/10",10.0,clarinets,2003/05/14,114,78

706,Hotel Transylvania,Adequate,"In order to escape from the constant depredations of hostile villagers (which resulted in the death of his wife), Count Dracula has opened a hotel catering only to assorted supernatural clientele (Frankenstein's monster, werewolves etc.). This is also convenient for protecting his daughter Mavis, despite her wish to explore farther afield now she has come of age (a rather arbitrary 118 - not sure why it should be an extra 100 years for a vampire, but never mind). Into this oasis of calm comes Jonathan, an inadvertent human tourist, and he and Mavis fall for each other. This is a CGI animated movie with a good voice cast, headed up by Adam Sandler doing a creditable job as Dracula. It is essentially a kids' movie and should be judged as such. By that criterion it is effective: the characters are (mostly) sympathetic, there are some decent gags (though, for me, no belly laughs), constant action (though no great surprises), and the film works OK. For all that, though, it leaves no lasting impression - it is fair to regard it as adequate, it would be overstating the case to make it out to be much more than that. I wasn't able to see the 3D version, and so cannot comment on the 3D.",7.0,neil-476,2012/10/26,4,3
707,Detachment,"An ode to teachers, to people who try to do good no matter what","This is a very depressing film about a teacher that tries to make a little difference although he realizes he is only a tiny pawn against a failing system. Not just the educational system but the entire world that is slowly, but steadily drifting into a failing society for most. No matter how depressing it is – and it is, in some ways it even reminded me of Pink Floyd's The Wall – this film is impressive and worth the time to watch. Is it one of those artsy pretentious films? Not at all. As someone in his review said (thank you bobmichigan1): ""Terrence Malick should take a look at this movie to understand how art films are supposed to be made not just images reflecting on a screen but real emotions included"".

708,Spider-Man 2,"Mature, nuanced and layered; the superhero genre at some of its very best.","It's hard to decide whether or not I prefer this film to the first, as it tells - in some ways - a more mature, nuanced and layered tale, but what isn't hard to decide is that 'Spider-Man 2 (2004)' is a fantastic movie and easily one of the best sequels of all time. The villain is wonderfully rounded, his motivations constantly clear and his character arc drawn in full before the credits roll, and presents both a physical and psychological challenge for our hero. The story expertly balances the phenomenally fun yet still emotionally resonant web-slinging sequences (a high-speed train in danger provides one of the feature's nicest character moments whereas the whole 'bank' section is amazingly accomplished and thunderously entertaining) with the relatable central dilemma of our very human protagonist. Raimi's directing seems to be stepped up a little, too, as he leans further into his own quirky style - evident in the renowned 'surgery' scene which is one of the best in the entire film. The entire piece just gels together to make a cohesive, complex and rare example of the superhero genre at some of its very best. 9/10",9.0,Pjtaylor-96-138044,2018/02/14,32,20
709,Interstellar,A great subject idea damaged by the plot and saved by Zimmer,"Even the title Interstellar evokes greatness, and the movie express this greatness through terrific photography supported by great picture quality (go to IMAX 70mm) and definitely communicated by soundtrack. Nolan knows that when you have Hans Zimmer on board you have an insurance: with his music you can transform even your dog daily service in an epic movie. Moreover the movie has a wonderful editing which give a great pace to the story. 9/10 on everything up to now. But when it comes down to the plot we barely reach 6/10. I will never understand why those Hollywood mega-productions that can do everything and have all these great subjects cannot avoid to make trivial mistakes across the plot. While looking at the movie it is like realizing that some good person had great ideas starting from the subject following with great details like the dust, the robots, the hibernation beds, and then somebody comes and place here and there some very simple mistakes. Here some: First of all,the whole thing does not add up: the first time Cooper leave earth, who sent him the NASA coordinate?? NON SENSE. second, at the starting of the movie you know the ending because too much emphasis has been placed on the message 'STAY'. I understand it adds a lot of drama to the departure scene but really spoils the ending. From there on you are only curious on how he will communicate back, which became clearer while watching the rest of the movie. Third, I loved the transition between the departure from home with the truck and the rocket launch BUT wait a moment. Three stages Saturn V rocket to reach the Earth orbit (..OK they were using spares from Apollo mission..OK..) and in all the rest of the movie these guys land and launch from 3 different earth-like planets by using simply the small spacecraft??? C'mon. Fourth, OK, you are trapped and the only person who can save humanity by communicating through time and what is the first thing you send to your daughter? Of course binary coded coordinates of NASA installation!! Not your name, not her name, but coordinates of the NASA launch site, so that the younger-yourself can LEAVE!If only all that you want is for him to STAY which is what you will send immediately after. OK maybe he do not know that he, him self, will start the whole thing just by following those coordinates..:/ WTF!!why?? Guys, I can understand you need to send Cooper to NASA, but couldn't you find something else? Fifth. This is minor, but really annoys me that in 2014, in the Interstellar production, you, screenwriters team, need AGAIN to make someone to slide and fall and trap her leg to create AGAIN the run-for-it-but-I-cant scene, on a planet in which every minute is a year wasted in the search for humanity salvation and to bring back some unknown data!? C'MON! You guys, have the best technicians and movie artisans, can afford almost everything you like, then again, why you have to slide on the banana peel?

712,The Wailing,Curiously overrated,"Strange. Take 10 minutes to check all the reviews here. The cautious reader will notice a large amount of repetition in the wording of reviews, allegedly by different people. The word ""masterpiece"" is thrown around quite a bit and many gave this film a 9 or 10 out of 10. I am here to say that this is not a perfect film as claimed by these reviews. Go ahead. Give this movie half an hour. Do you agree it's a masterpiece yet? If you're worried about unfairly judging it, sacrifice the whole 2-and-a-half hours of your life. If you believe it's a masterpiece as alleged by that point, please post your review explaining why. My issues: * As pointed out by many reasonable viewers on this site, the main characters were laughable - Korean keystone cops! Literally falling around on the ground, screaming and yelling at every opportunity, and just generally doing a poor job. Hello writers - your protagonist has to be relatable and no-one wants to relate to a bumbling fool. * Which reminds me - to preemptively shut up the patronizing racists who gave this movie a 10 out of 10 (!!!) simply because it's Korean / ""foreign"", no, it's not a cultural difference thing. Memories of Murder was a great Korean film featuring cops that suffered few if any of the ridiculous flaws that this alleged masterpiece has. * The movie didn't know if it wanted to be a comedy, action, horror, thriller, mystery, or....anything. Many simple tropes are thrown around, most with no clear resolution. * Uh, The Irishman was too long - and this ain't no Irishman. There is no excuse for dragging this mess on for 2 1/2 hours. Poor editing. * Terrible writing. What was the point of the priest and / or the shaman? Was the villain a Japanese guy just because of racism? What was the real story with the female ghost? Was the kid still haunted at the end? Whatever happened with the dude in the pickup truck? Come on - after giving hours of our lives to this thing at least throw some basic answers our way. Stay cautious. Most critical reviews are trying to warn / help you. The glowing reviews are almost certainly shills or idiots ( 10 out of 10? Really?). Don't waste your time like I did. Yes, this movie delivers on wailing during the movie - there's a lot of it - but you don't want to be wailing AFTER it.",5.0,bonsai-superstar,2020/07/10,16,11
713,Crash,Volatile Redemption,"""Crash"" is a complex movie with a simple premise: set in Los Angeles it follows 8 main characters (and many, many more supporting) from all walks of life and races whose lives intersect at some point during one 24 hour period. These people are all different yet all alienated, to the point of breaking, so much so that when they come together, things explode. The complexity of the film comes from the encounters between characters and their tangled lives and worlds. Haggis' screenplay is so intricate and delicately written I couldn't begin to try to summarize the actual plot line (which destines this article to be kind of vague), but everyone meets everyone else at some point in the film (and there are a whole lot of characters). Sufficed to say these meetings are variably intense, casual, fleeting, dangerous, but they all effect the participants in profound and provocative ways, causing lives to find enlightenment or swerve violently, and watching it all unfold is mesmerizing because Paul Haggis (Oscar Nominated writer of Million Dollar Baby) made the film meaty with messy characters and topics and stories to chew and hurtle along with. The all-encompassing theme of the film is racism, and it is dealt with bluntly, honestly, and without reservation. Every single character participates in the perpetuation of the ugly cycle but also suffers because of it. Where racism makes for an interesting enough subject for an already provoking and fairly experimental film (I was surprised to see this get wide release), it's only the catalyst for a deeper, resounding story of redemption and the universality of our lonely situation which the movie becomes during its second hour (what you could call Act II). It switches from a somewhat depressing contemplative amalgamation of moments about racism in everyday life and how destructive it is, to a throbbing, intense web of choices and consequences -- life and death, vivifying or soul killing -- and the chance at redemption. Following their actions in Act I, everyone meets a fork in the road or is given a second chance of some sort. Some take it, some don't, but regardless, by the end of the movie everyone has changed. This is what gives the movie wings during its second hour, makes it interesting, keeps you guessing and on knife's-edge. It also gives the characters depth and souls and shows that despite perceived and upheld differences, when it comes down to it we aren't different (which we see in a shattering scene between Ryan Philippe and Larenz Tate after Tate notices that he and Philippe have the same St. Christopher statue), in fact we desperately need each other. It's one of the few films I've seen where everyone is at fault somehow and yet there are no villains. It makes it hopeful, particularly with something as ugly as racism: everyone's fallible, but everyone has the capacity for good and nobility. That said, each of these character's inner struggles makes for all the conflict and resolution you need. A talented ensemble drives the film, sharing almost equal amounts of screen time, but the folks who really stood out and had my full attention each time were Terrence Howard (plays a TV director), Matt Dillon (as a patrol cop), Sandra Bullock (a rich housewife), , Don Cheadle (a detective), and Michael Peña (a locksmith). These five gave deeply, deeply felt performances portraying a wide range of emotions and personal situations, giving souls -- alone, yearning, and searching in a world that doesn't seem to care -- to shells of imperfect people. But the actors triumph in little moments of human contact: a glance, an embrace, a pause, a smile, a wince, things that breath the film to life and with simple visuals give it profundity. This is beautifully illustrated in a small scene between the downward spiraling Jean (Sandra Bullock) and her maid after she's begun to realize all her problems may not be about the two black guys who car jacked her, but her own life. Some closing notes: it's obvious it's a debut. At times the dialogue and acting can be stilted and unnatural; some of the initial ""racial"" situations seem forced; certain scenes could have used some editing or fine tuning, but by the end I didn't care. It also may be helpful to know that the first hour spends its time setting everything up for Act II, although it will seem more like a photo essay on racism than a setup. But by the time Act I ends you're ready for something substantial to happen, and at the perfect moment, stuff happens. I was entirely satisfied with this movie, I couldn't have asked for anything more. Still it's impressive, with his debut Haggis made a film that magically maintains a storytelling balancing act about people's lives that almost seamlessly flows, takes an honest look at racism with an understanding of mankind, a belief in redemption, and even hope. As I walked out of the theater into the rainy night it resonated with me and colored my thoughts as I made my way through the crowds of unknown fellow people filling the cinema. That's about all I can ask for in a film.",10.0,mercybell,2005/05/13,996,675

717,October Sky,Everything about this movie is wonderful!,"Watching this movie for the umpteenth time, I'm once again impressed by how wonderful a movie this really is. From the very opening moments to the very end, it's just beautifully done. If you're looking for dangerous, heart-pounding, shoot-em-up action, don't rent this movie; this isn't a film of that genre. That's not to say it's boring -- far from it. But this is a movie about life, specifically the true-life late 1950's story of a high-school boy named Homer who, inspired by world events and his teacher, found that his dreams were bigger than the tiny West Virginia town he grew up in. Those dreams were sparked by something that appeared in the October sky of 1957. Interestingly, rearrange the letters of the movie and you get the original title of the book the movie is based upon: ""October Sky"" <===> ""Rocket Boys"" This is not a video to rent. This is a video to OWN, especially if you have kids. You'll watch it several times, forget about it for a year, pull it out again, and then enjoy it just as much when you dust it off. If you're going to be watching it with younger kids, be advised that the film does contain some of what we in our family call ""rude language"" (nothing your kids aren't going to hear sooner or later anyway, or have already heard if they go to public school -- but a bit of parental discretion with younger kids advised)",10.0,john in missouri,2003/03/28,1,1
718,The Green Mile,As wonderful as the book!,"""The Green Mile"" is one of my favorite Stephen King books and I have read it several times. I was anxiously anticipating the film version, but was concerned that the emotional impact of the book could not be replicated on screen. Fortunately this wonderful story was adapted by Frank Darabont, who did such a magnificent job bringing King's ""Shawshank Redemption"" to the screen. He does the same high quality work with ""The Green Mile"". The story is faithful to the book, only losing details that were not important to the story anyway. The casting is superb - every actor is perfectly suited for his role and does an excellent job, although I would like to single out Doug Hutchison. His portrayal of the detestable Percy is right on the mark and suggests complexities in this character I had not discovered in the book. The length is about three hours and it seems that critics are complaining about that. I can't understand the complaints. The film never drags and is never dull, and it certainly didn't feel three hours long. The length is needed to tell this story the way it should be told, and the story is so very engrossing. Best of all, Darabont and the actors bring so much emotion ot the screen, that I cried like a baby through several scenes. ""The Green Mile"" will haunt you.",10.0,KathyT,1999/12/15,673,624
719,Moon,A worthwhile one-man show,"Originally posted to titsandgore.com, April 2009: Moon is an auspicious debut from Duncan Jones (née Zowie Bowie), a talented new director who happens to be the son of David Bowie (let me officially be the first person to predict that every review of this film in the mainstream press will have the tagline ""SPACE ODDITY!""). Sam Rockwell gives a truly remarkable performance as Sam Bell, a lunar miner who is nearing the end of his 3-year contract at a single-man mining outpost. His only companion is the station computer, Gertie, a straight-up HAL homage that tantalizingly suggests how a culture informed by decades of watching 2001 might choose to design a companion robot. To say too much more about the plot would be to spoil its central conceit, and while I'm sure many reviewers will talk openly about it, I want to preserve the surprise if at all possible at least until the film gets its theatrical release this coming June. Suffice it to say that Jones admirably mixes together stock genre tropes, paying tribute to a number of classic science fiction features while retaining his own idiosyncratically dark vision. Familiar filmic concepts of the ""clean future"" and the ""dirty future"" are mixed together to create a unique atmosphere; the milieu is suitably claustrophobic, the cramped quarters of the mining station serving the film's conceptual purposes while masking the shoestring budget. In fact, it may be hard to spare a glance at the meticulously designed sets with your eyes glued to Rockwell for the duration of the picture. His performance is utterly mesmerizing, inhabiting the role so completely that it is impossible to imagine any other actor having the chutzpah to pull it off. Which is not to say that Moon is without its problems; the pacing is hardly consistent and Jones' reliance on Rockwell tends to undersell his direction. Parts of the film veer dangerously close to identical thematic elements in Steven Soderbergh's recent adaptation of Solaris, without being as emotionally potent. But what it lacks in originality is mostly compensated for by the sheer audacity of its central performance and the careful economy of its direction. Moon may be dressed in familiar clothing, but it is a singular experience, a clever, darkly funny and genuinely moving journey into the nature of individuality. Jones is already at work on a second science fiction feature, and it is welcome indeed to see such a promising new talent continue to develop his voice by working in genre film-making!",7.0,mike-1145,2009/06/12,251,193
720,Crash,2005's Biggest Disappointment.,"Crash is a film that is trying much too hard to try and show a part of society that is already painfully obvious. Stop and think... you are in the middle of a public place and someone shouts ""HEY! RACISM EXISTS! AND I'M NOT GOING TO DO A THING ABOUT IT!"" Now imagine how you would feel? What is such an exclamation worth if there is no resolve offered with it? Crash is a collection, for the most part, of absurdly shallow stories with overly clichéd characters. With the exception of the moving performance delivered by Michael Pena, the acting is significantly flawed and irritating. Most importantly, is the complete lack of depth and progression of the majority of the cast. The words ""cliche"" and ""redundant"" can not be used enough to describe the racial representations in Crash. The White's (Bullock, Dillon, and Fraser) are incredibly dull, phobic, uneducated and stereotypically shown as the ""we are the dominant race,"" because of course Crash would not be much of a movie without a ""bad guy."" Next, we have the African Americans, which is an almost embarrassing and degrading representation. We have a ""social intellect"" who as he steals cars, continues on his ""the white man is keeping the black man down"" rants. The blacks also have the over the edge ""black pride"" role of Thandie Newton. While breaking the law and then crying a string of ""this is because i'm black"" proclamations, you can't help but wonder WHY this character was put in this movie, did Paul Haggis WANT us to dislike the blacks in Crash? The thing i can't understand the most about Crash, is the acclaim that Terrence Howard received for his role. After the blatant ignorance of his wife Newton's character, Howard makes a split from her and carries on the majority of the film conflicted about himself as a man, an African American and a husband. This was the only shot Crash really had at character development, and it failed. Newton's character evolves NONE from start to finish in Crash, and Terrence's character, with whatever revelation he quietly achieves in his own mind, is never shared with the audience, thus making his return to Newton at the end a total waste of whatever change we thought he was building up to. Another huge disappointment of Crash was the complete irrelevance of the supporting cast (Cheadle, Esposito, Phillippe). There is not a scene involving these characters that furthers the story or enhances the film in any way without just adding to the ever accumulating pile of redundancy. If the complete failure of character structure and advancing plot is not enough to be making you want to hit the stop button, then perhaps the complete lack of innovative camera work is. From the opening scene to the closing credits, Crash fails to deliver anything innovative to film, technique, or the ever pressing battle on racism. Do we as a society have a serious problem with racism? Yes. Are we as a society aware of this? Yes. Do we need a film that presents no resolution nor challenges the idea of racism to try and drive the point home? Most certainly not. I was thoroughly irritated and disappointed with this film.",3.0,s_cadzow,2006/01/10,36,23

723,Blackfish,Blackfish,"Blackfish, a documentary directed by Gabriella Cowperthwaite, is an eye-opening look at the killer whale, our history of capturing them from the wild for Sealand and later SeaWorld, and why this is a mistake. I actually watched this film twice in a row yesterday, and I think that what I gleamed most from this message is a lesson on social behavior. The most moving testimonies from interviewees who are mostly former trainers expounded on how they didn't see how they were doing anything wrong. Indeed, if you went to any zoo or SeaWorld while Tilikum was performing it is not easy to see past the way people are behaving socially to see the problem. Looking back, it is common sense that if you believe wild animals have any value whatsoever (I understand some people don't) then there is something wrong with capturing a bunch of them from their natural surroundings and placing them in a pool, keeping a 4,000 pound animal in a 20 by 30 foot box for two thirds of their life, ripping mothers from their young, and watching them get violent with each other and then with trainers...is just stupid and unethical. But all those smiling faces at the amusement park and the indoctrination of trainers telling them they are doing good for the animals obscures what seems so obvious. But I also think it is important to look at the implications of the film for humans as well. The killer whale is incredibly intelligent and studies done by neuroscientists confirm that their brains have an additional segment connected to the part that controls emotion. They have an emotional dimension and capacity that we can't even understand, like a monkey doesn't understand problem solving past simple puzzles for a reward. The film cites footage of mass strandings where the whales refuse to let one of their own die alone, instead they all stay with him....the same for getting caught in hunters' nets. Their communication is so individually varied and unique that you have to call it language, and when a mother is separated from her child, she sits alone, shaking and screaming....I don't know how you can interpret that as a the reaction of a dumb, unaware animal. But we as humans are also social creatures. You distort nature and the natural way of living, as we've done a fabulous job of, then we too start to rip each other apart, (when whales do it it's called ""raking"") and become frustrated, angry, and sad. But sure enough the government tells us they are doing things ""for our good"" and with all the smiling faces in the largest amusement park in the world, what may be uncovered with a little research and education is indeed obscured. funkyforestfirstcontact.wordpress.com",9.0,emilyelizabeth1283,2013/12/28,5,4
724,October Sky,A Great Family-Drama Film,"I grew up in Southern West Virginia; I'm about the same age as (or maybe a year older than) Homer Hickam, author of ""The Rocket Boys,"" the book forming the true-story basis of this heart-warming film. And so I relate closely to the West Virginia coal-mining theme, and to the stunning effect Sputnik had at that time (October 4, 1957) on all of us. The Rocket Boys went on to make great lives for themselves. I went on to get my degrees in Physics and Computer Engineering. All because Sputnik woke up a lot of young people to the ""Science Gap"" the U.S.S.R. had on the U.S. in those Cold War days... This is a wonderful film for everyone, of all ages. But if you grew up in West Virginia in the late 1950's, it'll touch the core of your being.

725,Primal Fear,Very well worked out court story,"As many, I did not expect too much of this movie but hey, Edward Norton was in it, so why not give it a shot... When it was on TV a second time, I was like: ""Ow yeah, Primal Fear! That movie's goooood!"" The introduction is very well written as directed as we get to know the main characters. I really liked Richard Gere's character, especially his intentions as a lawyer, which he quotes in the bar after getting drunk; thought-provoking words... Gere's acting in this film was better than his average performance. But the real star of this movie is definitely EDWARD NORTON!!! He makes you a slave to the screen and blows you away at the same time. I'm really frustrated by the fact he didn't win the Oscar here; he received a Golden Globe though... The story itself is good, very well worked out. Primal Fear is definitely worth the watch!",8.0,DzeFrenchman,2008/01/18,7,6
726,Pulp Fiction,I guess I just don't get it,"I think that there is a herd mentality about this film. Because Tarantino cultists liked it, people say things like ""the best film of the 90's"". People seem to think that they are not cool unless they loved Pulp Fiction. Maybe I just don't get it, but what is so great about it? It's circular, big deal. The entire film is pointless, and I really don't care about any of the characters. The violence is gratuitous. I am not squeamish. I have watched, and, I have to admit, enjoyed Romero's ""dead"" films. It is supposedly funny when the kid gets shot in head and his brain is splattered all over the inside of the car. Yep, that is hilarious. The only good thing about the film is that John Travolta is in it.",2.0,Q-Man,2004/12/17,82,37
727,Detachment,This film should be REQUIRED viewing for everyone on the planet!,"**This might contain spoilers, I'm not sure, as I haven't written it yet, but i don't wanna be blacklisted! (okay, i finished writing & there are no spoilers):P Anyway, for starters, I just gave it 10 stars, which I rarely, if ever do! That is how amazing, disturbing, touching, RELEVANT & everything else this film is. (I cap words that I'm putting emphasis on, is that verboten on here? As I've written reviews w/caps in it & had them not be able to post no matter how many times I tried. I didn't ""break"" any rules, in any way, so I still am not sure what is going on there). This film goes straight to the root of the largest problem in our society. Detachment. Being more ""connected"" (i.e. all of the phone, internet stuff where you are ""connected"" to everyone in the world & everyone you ever knew and yet you are more disconnected then you have ever been. People don't talk to each other anymore, rarely. Don't actually CALL each other, or go out & see each other face to face. Sure there are exceptions, but I'm biding my time waiting for the day when none of us will ever leave our homes & just stay connected through technology. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for technology, but NOT at this price! I could go on and on about this movie, but I won't. Suffice to say that there is a plethora of A list, excellent actors in this film. Mostly cameos. They have a couple of lines, if that. That says to me that the subject matter/the script/the director/all of the above...something called to each of them to be in such a movie, no matter how tiny the role. It is a must see, as simple as that!",10.0,hedwig0109,2014/02/10,8,5
728,Interstellar,"""In order for man to move forward, they must leave something behind.""","-Plot- The year is unknown, but most likely close to present time. The Earth is running out of resources and a group of underground NASA workers seek the help of Engineer/Astronaut turned Farmer Mr. Cooper in taking a journey across the Galaxy and through a wormhole in hopes of a future for mankind on the other side. That is the gist of the exposition of the plot. It's mostly quite clear what this movie is about through previews. On paper this sounds like a typical sci-fi plot, but Chris Nolan executes it like never before. The movie seems to be getting more mixed reviews from critics compared to his other films, and I think I have an explanation. Nolan and his team had too much faith in it's audience. The movie is full of science and dialogue strongly textured with physics theories. The talk of wormholes and Black holes are key to the movie. But I know that many will be left confused even with the explanations of what is going on to make everything in the film scientifically possible. After all, Physicist Kip Thorne was a consultant for the movie! I found it quite educational, interesting, but also over done at times. A good majority of people who watch this movie will be turned off by the abundance of scientific talk throughout the movie. I personally loved it and was never lost, but I could understand why many people were frustrated with the constant turns in the plot and overlong length. I found this movie to be amazing. Sure, at times the dialogue was hard to even understand. There was a scene where a major character is dying, and as he speaks his last words, it's almost impossible to decipher what is said. It was also almost unintentionally humorous. But that was a small price to pay and I'm sure the subtitles of the Blu Ray release will save that scene for me. The directing and cinematography are gorgeously done. The camera angles really bring the movie to life. Simple shots from the point of view of the rear of a truck or spaceship never looked so amazing. The visuals were undeniably beautiful whether the setting was in space, on the foreign planet or even the decaying Earth. The music of the film by Hans Zimmer deserves so much recognition! I will even say it was better than the score for Inception. It really increased the tension and pushed for emotional heartache in many parts of the film. There are many tense scenes that will have you holding on along with the characters in the movie and a good portion of this effect is due to the musical score! The acting was top class. Matthew M gave one of the greatest human performances in history as Mr. Cooper. I seriously think it was better than his Dallas Buyers Oscar Winning performance. I really hope he gets recognition for this. There are more than a few scenes that will make even the most cold hearted person feel like crying. He was just amazing. Anne Hathaway gave a stunning emotional performance as the flawed Bland. Jessica Chastain has a few strong moments as well. There is a scene regarding her character breaking down which will definitely make your eyes water. The supporting cast all do justice to the movie too, but Matthew and Jessica gave the best performances without a doubt. In a way, this movie resembles Inception in certain areas. Inception had a hint of relativity in it with the time differences between the dreams, the real world and limbo. Interstellar adds to that with the inclusion of a planet in the other galaxy in which every hour is equal to 7 years outside of its atmosphere. In Inception, a central character is left behind and lost in the limbo world with its major difference of time. In Interstellar, a central character is left behind in the other galaxy to find a new home while the other leaves to help the current home adjust until then. In Inception, a central character is old for a moment in limbo at the end due to the difference in time relativity. In Interstellar, the time relativity affects the entire human race as the astronauts are in the other galaxy. In both movies, the main character has left behind children and longs to be reunited. Inceptions main character doesn't want to see his children's faces until they are truly reunited. But in Interstellar, he holds on to the image of their faces as a survival tactic. This movie is full of Christopher/Jonathan Nolan-isms. Overall, I think that this movie should be seen in theaters on the big screen if you have the chance. It was a true experience. Be sure to be attentive and to clear your bladder first though. It will make you think. At times it might make you check your watch, but please endure and you will be treated to one of the most intriguing films of all time. Even if you think you didn't like the film, there is no doubt that you will be thinking about the contents of the plot and beauty of the visuals long after the credits roll.",10.0,AlukardsCastle,2014/11/08,268,146
729,Primal Fear,A great movie filled with twists and turns,"This movie is probably one of the most powerful crime dramas ever made. Although the story can be hard to follow at times, (mainly the south river developement story)it is still fast paced and well done entertainment. i found myself really enjoying it when i saw it on hbo awhile back, then on tv again, then i bought it. now, i consider it to be one of my favorite films of all time. Richard Gere is in top form, as is Edward Norton, who shines as the charming altar boy Aaron Stampler. It was a crime he didn't win an academy award for this performance. This movie has a little bit of comedy, action, and a whole lot of great dramatic suspense and twists. if you our considering seeing this movie, don't consider it. Do it! You will be happy you were a witness to this cinematic masterpiece.",,reservoirdogs07,2004/03/13,2,2
730,Death of a Salesman,Kate Reid Steals the Show,Famous play which has had several film depictions. I understand this movie was filmed in a theater. Aging salesman who is delusional and suicidal cannot cope with his failed life. The main character Willy Loman is played by Dustin Hoffman. I did not see Willy Loman;I only saw Dustin Hoffman playing that part. I understand there are far better portrayals of Loman elsewhere. In this movie I thought Kate Reid stole the show closely followed by John Malkovitch. This film succeeds as an intense and compelling drama not because of Hoffman but despite him. 7/10,7.0,rbrb,2013/07/29,4,2
731,Taxi Driver,A Shattering Tale In First Person Singular,"The impact that ""Taxi Driver"" had in its day hasn't diminished, on the contrary, it has acquired a relevance of Shakesperean proportions. Travis's loneliness is a hyper representation of the same loneliness most humans have experienced at different times in different measures. It is always associated with a nightmare and Martin Scorsese delivers it like a nightmare. Travis, possessed by Robert De Niro at the zenith of his powers, cruises in his taxi enveloped in Bernard Herrman and we, well, we're the passengers and everything looks terrifying and familiar at the same time. Paul Schrader sensational screenplay comes to life with the jolting force of a rude awakening. Like it happens, more often than not, with masterpieces, it signed in a rather direct way the lives of the ones who live it in a movie theater and the ones who made it. Scorsese being the giant that he is, survived it and will continue startling us I'm sure but I also bet that for years everything he did was compared to this movie. De Niro and his ""You looking at me"" became such an iconic phrase that even he himself ended up impersonating it. Jodie Foster awoke the insane devotion of a real life would be killer and New York, the greatest city in the world was shown with its underbelly up. A work of art, a superlative reminder of what film could actually give us and very rarely does.",10.0,willandthomas-picturehou,2007/10/11,214,167
732,Crash,Clashing Crash In Devil's City,"Lives, ordinary lives, vital part of a city where, I'm sure, the devil has him home. Contradictory, awful, enlightened, confused. There are so many good moments in ""Crash"" that I felt the need to see it again less than 24 hours later. Matt Dillon lead us through his own contradiction with the humanity of someone who knows he carries something rotten inside. The explosive dissatisfaction that permeates Sandra Bullock's life is ferociously real and the frustration of Thandie Newton's character is a first on the screen. We've never seen it quite like that and her performance will stay with me. Larenz Tate personifies both sides of the equation, the one who understands but goes against his instincts, and still there are chilling flashes of innocence in his eyes -- his performance reminded me of the wonderful ""Seeds Of Tragedy"" were his innocence was intact. The problem with ""Crash"" and it is problem is that remains a rather shallow affair. Cleverly put together but epidermic at best.",7.0,marcosaguado,2005/12/04,110,61

735,October Sky,Highly Overlooked Film.,"My Science Teacher let me borrow a film for the past weekend and I picked October Sky. I of course looked at the reviews of IMDb to see if it was any good. After seeing the many positive reviews I decided to sit and watch it. The film is about Homer Hickam played by Jake Gyllenhaal and his 3 friends Quentin played by Chris Owens, Roy Lee played by William Lee Scott, and O'Dell played by Chad Lindenburg who witness the first artificial satellite named Sputnik go into orbit in October of 1957. This prompts Homer and his friends to build a series of rockets and try to launch them into orbit. However his father played by Chris Cooper wants him to work in the coal mine much to Homers dissatisfaction. This was really good. The film is not your normal '50's movie like Grease(1978) this one takes a more serious route. The things I like about it: I love the performances from Jake Gyllenhaal and Chris Cooper, The plot captures what the real Homer Hicam did and yes this is based on a true story. I love how the movie is not to serious and how it does have humor in it. The only thing with this movie that I have a problem with is the Language. Yes I know I watch a lot of films with strong language but this is rated PG. Just because a movie has a PG Rating doesn't mean you have to use a ton of language once in a while it's fine, but not in every scene. I still say it is a very fun movie to watch. Rated PG For Language, Brief Teen Sensuality And Alcohol Use, And For Some Thematic Elements. 1hr 48min/108min. ****/****",10.0,kylehaines96,2012/02/07,1,1

Despite of the unimpressive acting, this movies grasps the attention of the audience because of its great special effects and stylized action. The script wasn't that good but it wasn't bad aswell. I think this is the greatest comic book that has been made into a movie. Sam Raimi did a great job making the sequel. I think the direction was perfect. This movie is also a bit hilarious. Like the scene in the elevator. Tobey Mcguire acted well being Peter Parker. I think Kirsten Dunst should not be in the third part. She acts pathetically. I gave this movie 10/10 and I think it deserves to be in the top 250 movies of IMDb. I recommend this movie to everyone who loved the first part. Don't wait for its DVD. Go to the theaters and watch it. I think that this movie is worth watching.",10.0,aghahusnainraza316,2004/08/15,3,3
737,Blackfish,"For those who dreamed of one day going to Sea World, this film gives you 2nd thoughts.","Like many people who grew up in the 90s, part of my childhood fantasies were going to Disney World and going to SeaWorld. Of course, neither of which were close, or affordable, so that never happened. But, going to both places, especially Disney World, never leaves your hopes and dreams, and seemingly becomes the type of trip you do with your kids not just as a treat, but because you want to live vicariously through them. But, one night while watching Bill Maher's Real Time, there was an interview about this film and it was quite disparaging. Now, with the movie easily available, I found myself intently watching. To begin, there aren't any characters in the film, per se, but there are repeat faces. Many of them are former SeaWorld trainers and while we watch and listening to their discussions, you realize one thing: None of them really were qualified when they first started their positions as trainers. They will even tell you that themselves, for none of them had advanced degrees in marine biology or veterinarian care, they were simply animal lovers who found a job. And they convey a sense of naivety as we go from talking about their background to meeting a slew of killer whales, with the film giving a spotlight on one in particular: Tilikum. As for the overall ""story"" of the film. What the documentary looks into is similar to what The East tried to do. Companies like SeaWorld have incidents and accidents yearly, in fact, there supposedly have been at least 70 incidents with killer whales since the 1970s. But, since this was the time before the internet, they quickly wrote most things off as ""accidents"" and faulted the trainer more so than the animal. However, in this film we see what happens to these animals to make so these events are certainly no accident. It all very much plays out like a Killer Whale version of the triangular trade. We watch as these animals are taken from their cultures, and their families, and forced to work day in and day out for the measliest of meals. Because of this, they become frustrated, are sometimes forced into isolation and sometimes end up having to fend against those they cohabit with for despite being the same species, as we learn, between their cultural differences and gender, this can lead them to attacking, if not killing each other. And the film doesn't just show Tilikum, as if he is a rare example, but various whales since the 70s which really help substantiate their claim. Now to be honest, I am not a huge animal lover. This isn't to say I would kick a dog in the street, but at the same time I wouldn't be the type of pick him or her up and take her to an animal hospital. With that said though, this is the type of film, which I wish The East was. A film that really makes you want to be involved, even if it is just spreading this film around. I say this because, to me, it really does make you upset at companies like SeaWorld when you learn about these intelligent animals and what happens to them in captivity. Also, it makes you feel supremely ignorant like when you learn what is happening in Syria is just a repeat of the past, or how things are going on in the country, state, or even town you live in, and don't know a damn thing about what is going on. So, needless to say, the film is very informative and provides not just testimonies, but also pictures and videos of not just whales attacking humans, but also the environment which turns an intelligent animal into a beast. But, one thing I do wish there was more of, though their argument would have been hard to fight with, was some opposition. Naturally, SeaWorld didn't comment at all in the film, but instead they got one former trainer who seemed so much like a stooge that you just roll your eyes whenever he appears. And really, that would have been the only thing I would have wanted more of. For the film finds other companies which admit guilt, as well as people who made a living capturing Killer Whales, but the lack of any real opposition or serious counter argument makes it so you don't necessarily think they are lying to you, but you really do want to get into the head of the people who support and continue this practice. Overall: Definitely a Go See Truth be told, I like documentaries with some type of narrative like this and what Disney produces time to time. But, it should be noted, this is a bit more like an expose than Disney's ""look at these cute, but deadly, animals act like live-action versions of what makes us money."" With that said, I do recommend seeing this movie if you are curious, an animal lover looking for some facts for a future argument or someone, like me, who has had an interest in places like SeaWorld which thrive on animal entertainment. I can't say though if this is worth a buy or not, but it is at least a rental.",8.0,Amari-Sali,2013/09/30,15,12
738,Goodfellas,Completely Pointless - This is way overrated,"I was bored in study hall, it was a Friday before a long break, so I decided to watch this movie. Have you ever listened to a song compressed to an unreasonable size? This is what this film is. Crushed to a time of around of 72 minutes, this story could really use two. The truth is, this film doesn't convey anything. There's no central point or conflict. ""Pulp Fiction"", a much better film, pulled off the lack of a main central conflict, but without any characterization, or a sense of a real journey this film suffers the same fate as the boring ""Aviator"". The story of a real person with a lot of glitz and gloss galore in every seen but a severe lack of content. Every seen moves very fast and everything happens instaneously and they use a narrator to fill in the blanks of information they use narrators. Characterization dies and a quick and painless death in this pointless script. I'm pretty sure the book writer and writer of the script had a central conflict or point of the film in mind when they wrote it, however, it never comes out in the film.

740,Interstellar,Pretty disappointing...,"Like many other reviewers, I'm giving this a 1 in a feeble attempt to balance out all the unwarranted 10s I keep seeing, even though I really think it deserves a 5, or maybe a 6. I actually created an account just to do this, so I figured I might as well include a review along with my rating. Many will say try to tell you that you shouldn't attempt to compare this movie to 2001, that they are two totally different movies, etc. This is ridiculous; they are quite similar on multiple levels, with Interstellar obviously taking many cues and inspirations from Kubrick's masterpiece. I feel that if we compare the two, we can get a good idea of where Nolan's film went wrong. The main reason 2001 has remained so powerful and held up so well is that it doesn't try to explain and rationalize everything that happens. We see the events of the movie unfold, but as the movie nears its psychedelic conclusion, we are really left to our own guesswork as to what is going on. Has he entered another dimension? An alternate universe? An alien spacecraft? Is he just dead? The mere fact that we have no idea whether this scene depicts something spiritual, something scientifically quantifiable, or a mix of the two makes it so much more moving than if Kubrick had tried to explain it through the available science of his time. Interstellar answers far too many questions, which, as is often the case, ends up raising infinitely more. Nolan makes it clear from the get go that this film is supposed to function on more of an emotional level than a scientific one. Then why even bother have the film ""fact checked"" by a astrophysicist? Why create this confusing mixture of real- and pseudo- science in the first place? To me, in a lot of scenes this kind of shatters the air of mysticism Nolan seemed to be going for. The ""floating bookcase in a black hole"" sequence, for instance, seemed really magical until Cooper suddenly has a bunch of epiphanies and becomes positive that the structure was created by future humans, not aliens, that they created it specifically for him so he could navigate 5D and communicate with his daughter, and that he can save the world only by manipulating a watch with gravity. BOOM. There goes all the mystery. And lets assume his theory is correct, and this structure was indeed constructed by mankind from the future. Hmmm, guess it turns out that we didn't perish from constant dust storms after all—instead we survived hundreds of thousands of years into the future and went on to create mind-blowing, interdimensional space technology. Then what exactly is future us so worried about? They seem to be doing just fine without any alteration of the past. This is just the tip of the iceberg as far as far as all of the inconsistencies and unanswered questions you'll find in this movie. If you have a very analytical mind, steer clear of it—I am not a mathy or science-y person by any stretch, yet even I struggled at times to put my logic in the backseat and just enjoy the ride. That's what I'd advise you to do if you want to have a good time watching this movie: DON'T OVERTHINK IT. If you can just do that, you'll find an entertaining film with truly stunning visual effects, a great (if maybe a LITTLE too over the top) score from HZ, and very convincing performances from the actors. I found some scenes very moving. I liked the concept of a future that, as a result of a technological lull, doesn't look very different from our present. There are a lot of positive things to say about this film, and yet the end result is, sadly, maybe just a couple pegs above mediocre.",1.0,jmcf1594,2014/11/20,283,128

742,The Green Mile,One Of The Greatest Movies I Have Ever Seen!,"The Green Mile is my favorite movie! It was a complete roller coaster ride of emotions that made me cry. The end was the saddest when Michael Clarke Duncan's character is put on the chair although we know he is innocent and it was the crazy man locked up. I also thought it was so sad when they were watching the last movie that the prisoner got to watch before he died, and then Tom Hanks's character started to cry! I also loved how even though the prisoner was huge, he had a heart of gold, and he actually appeared cute and innocent to me during the whole movie. The only con of the movie was it took me a little bit to understand the murder of the little kids that was committed by the insane man in the movie. I also loved when the old Tom Hanks showed the old lady that he was telling the story to the mouse that was still alive. The amazing thing was i had watched this movie right after seeing Forrest Gump and I was worried that I wasn't going to be able to take Tom Hanks seriously, but I could!

744,Interstellar,Interstellar : An open-hearted & mastered Human Odyssey,"The film begins by establishing at his own rhythm its ambitions: men overexploited land resources, which is why the only goal they have left is to survive. This life is not enough for Cooper, brilliantly played by McConaughey who gave body and soul to this character. But all of this wouldn't hold without the total control of Christopher Nolan, based on the languishing soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, the luminous and impenetrable photography of Hoyte Van Hoytema, and the sincerity of Nolan's directing. He manages to film the characters and to find the right cut at the right time, always in harmony with Hans Zimmer's soundtrack, to give the film an aspiring and inspiring dimension that went missing for many many years. Thus we are transported into the same cockpit that Cooper, we feel the same remorse that he can already feel, we feel the same gravity, and we feel the same fear of the unknown melted with the force of his will. All of this is brilliantly illustrated in a very simple directing choice, which from my point of view is the decisive impetus of the film: to directly jump from when Cooper leaves in his truck, leaving his family behind him, to Endurance taking off. This simple editing decision allows Nolan to give an original movement to his film, and the musical crescendo makes us physically feel the sentimental break between two parts of the film. You don't necessarily have to understand it immediately : The film will raise questions in you, such as : what is it to be a human being, is there some physical limitations to our humanity, how far could we be willing to go to determine knowledge, is there other dimensions that we can not access to, and above all: what is the nature of this intact and immutable bond that unites us to others wherever we are in the universe ? Is this bond only intelligible, or is it also tangible ? All these questions resonate in harmony in Nolan's Interstellar. Interstellar is itself a crescendo, increasing sensitivity and creativity. I use the term deliberately because it goes crescendo with the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, which is one of the most beautiful music ever scored for a sci-fi movie. We are witnessing a perfect musical arrangement, a total symbiosis, a bit like the music of Gravity which had understood very well how to match the image and the rhythm of a sequence to its own musicality. Zimmer's crescendos are giving a new powerful breath to every new scene, whether it is in visually powerful & intense moments or in more intimate moments; it intrudes into our momentary feelings and sensations, and manages to extend them, sometimes almost to choking, before resting on the balance of the film frame along with our mind spell-bounded. I have seen all the talent of the director that I knew he was outside the norm, but whom I did not know his capacity to reinvent itself. Because this is it: Interstellar is not an action movie, not really a blockbuster, and it goes not entirely but mostly again the expectations of common people. It's much more than that. This is much more than just a sci-fi movie. It is unlike any of his previous films. Some hoped to see Interstellar as Christopher Nolan's best film, and they were disappointed that this was not the case. And indeed, THIS IS NOT THE BEST FILM of Christopher Nolan. Because in a way, IT IS HIS FIRST FILM. I'm not saying that Interstellar is not as good as his other films, it goes beyond all of them. But to me Interstellar is the first film of a new stage in Nolan's filmography ; it is a masterpiece as it the beginning of a work ahead. Interstellar is the proof that Nolan has finally managed, despite all the expectations that were placed on him after the success of The Dark Knight, to move away from his own reputation to create a personal work, original, humble, sincere and deeply, meticulously, measured. Now, in this third act of the film, it all comes to life with unparalleled strength. Nolan poses and answers questions that raise others. But he focuses his attention on the great mystery of love, that emotional bond that can unite men and sometimes separate them. But Nolan is the only one that can successfully speak of love from a being to another in a film that mainly takes place in a another galaxy. From my point of view, only Solaris by Steven Soderbergh (2002), unfortunately neglected by the audience, was able to accomplish that. Interstellar is based on a premise which is the following : from terrestrial dust to the depths of space and time, we can never be separated from who we are as individuals and as a species, as we always leave a part of ourselves ""behind"" us. In other words, I could say that this is a human story, and even if we go as far as we want to, if we travel through the universe believing that we can be detached of the one we are fond of, we will only get closer to them. Because the separation, and thus the distance and time, can only ultimately reinforce the relationship between the people who really love each other. Because it is going to the end of the world, when we reach the end of ourselves, that we reach the singularity of the ""black hole beyond the horizon"" * : it is our humanity. No, I wasn't been able to find any bad flaws in the film. Not one, and I'm still looking. After all, Interstellar is like gravity, ""all it takes is a little push ! "" *you'll have to see the movie to figure that one out. Félix Tardieu, November 1st, 2014",10.0,tardieu-felix,2014/11/01,3008,2134

Although it is on a rather unpleasant subject I found it a very moving and excellent film. I haven't cried so much in a film ever before this. It is a very powerful, wonderful film. Although some parts are shocking and horrible, and the subject is distasteful, you can not be anything but moved by it's relevance and mature approach to a very controversial topic.

It focuses on people struggling through their lives and living with pain and recognizes that everyone lives with pain, and that is something we all share. the moments in this movie which show compassion are truly amazing and heartwarming. I have read what the director wanted from the movie and Tony Kaye did a wonderful job. He picked a wonderful cast and I don't disagree with his decision to cast his own daughter because she played the role beautifully and convincingly and I also believe it would be hard on any parent to cast their own child into a role like that, but she absolutely completed the movie alongside everyone else. I love that hope is recognized in movies like this because it gives meaning to what it feels like to be alive.

748,The Chorus,The Chorus,"I selected to see this movie by default. It was high on rating, and I just gave it a chance, without knowing what to expect. The story is about a middle aged musician Clement Mathieu (Gerard Jugnot) who arrives at a boarding school for delinquent boys, held captive in fear by dictatorial head master Rachin (Francois Berleand). Gerard with his sensitive and mild ways changes the heart and mind of boys and teachers in the boarding school with simple inculcation of musical chorus among boys. He also tries pursues a relationship with a gifted singer boy Pierre's (Jean  Baptiste Maunier) mother Violette (Marie Brunel), who falls in love with an engineer instead. This is the first full fetch movie of the musician convert to Director Chritophe Barratier, who has won tremendous applause and credibility across the world, through this movie. The direction is good, the cinematography is excellent, and music heavenly. Yes at times the scripting, characters and events are clichéd. Gerard has given an outstanding performance as warm Clement Mathieu, with subtle expressions and emotions hidden behind his chubby self that is remarkable. It is a French movie and I loved it.

750,The Chorus,"A light, simple but a very intelligent and emotional film","When you look back at typically American films, with big budgets and heavy action scenes to stun and maximise viewing pleasure...they so very often fail. Recently i have been getting into foreign language films from France(Amelie), Italy(Cinema Paradiso) and Korea(Oldboy)and all of them have a lower budget and are less successful financially than your average Bruce Willis shoot'em'up. All the films i have encountered have had higher ratings and in some cases cult followings! What I'm saying is, these films obviously entertain (one of the soul purposes for films) so what is the purpose of the big budget pop corn movie is people are giving these independent and foreign language films a chance and are ....actually enjoying them! 'The Chorus' is a perfect example of this. It may not be the best film for depth and getting your teeth into and analysing but it does deeply entertain, it's an emotional experience for any audience. The acting is superb, very simple, almost slapstick comedy at times, comical timing is excellent by the supervisor (Gérard Jugnot), the performances of the children are brilliant but the only one who let them was the main boy at times. Well filmed with very appetising visual colours when you go on this journey of transformation of the school, the colour goes from depressing greys, to lively bold colours. The music is light but effective, a bit like the film. A little on the short side also! And all in all it is a brilliant little chapter in French cinema, which I have only just touched the surface of. Highly recommended!",8.0,RobertDurbin,2006/04/30,2,1

753,Ferris Bueller's Day Off,An 80's Classic That Has Aged Surprisingly Well,"Ferris Bueller's Day Off is a 1980's film gem that not only rises above its teen comedy genre, but escaped the outdated tag that now defines most of its peers. Written and directed by John Hughes, and starring Matthew Broderick as Ferris, the film is the tale of a spunky mischievous teenager who cuts school for the day with the ultimate of style and ""moxy"". Ferris is ultimately a tale of a self absorbed but lovable teen who just wants to have fun (with himself as the lead character). A little misguided and vain, but a character that ""most"" of the audience will root for nonetheless. NOTE: The story of Ferris Bueller is told from a young persons perspective, with the adults either relegated to minor roles, or portrayed as stick in the mud buffoons (for its intended audiences pleasure of course). This narrative is typical of most of Hughes best films, as is a certain ""cartoonishness"", so if not your cup of tea, your enjoyment of this film could be diminished. Ferris Bueller scores 8/10 (7 for the film itself plus 1/10 extra for the music)",8.0,CCRider01,2011/03/21,3,2
754,The Fault in Our Stars,Not Worth The Hype.,"Okay, okay. Before we begin to review this title, let's make it clear that I'm a man. Now, The Fault In Our Stars is a story about a girl name Hazel Grace who has cancer. The movie has a solid ground, and doesn't lose it's main focus. The acting was good, but what shined about the movie was the two main characters roles, they felt very natural as a couple, and when your making a love story it's very good to have natural actors (Unlike Twilight). However, the movie dragged a bit too much, I kept saying to myself ""Okay, when are you going to get to the point?"" But still, this wasn't a big problem once you get to the end. One of the biggest problems were that the director rushed the beginning, already three Minutes through the movie Hazel meets Augustus (Her Boyfriend) than, OH OH! There together, or are they? Wait, yeah there together, Nevermind they broke up. That's how it felt anyway. Also, one thing id like to point out is that the movie is not worth the hype! People are making such a big deal about a movie that from the first place wasn't all that great. Oh, another thing, SPOILER! The way they killed off Augustus was just HORRIBLE! We didn't even get a chance to feel bad for the guy because it was like ""Oh! He died that was unexpected"" Than Hazel crys for about 20 seconds than *Poof* Were at the funeral, than *Poof* were at the End credits. And than you kinda sit there like ""Well, that sucked"" So, anyways. This was my small review, again it's not THAT bad but it can wait until the DVD comes out.",5.0,Jdmaxgaming,2014/06/11,18,9

In this movie we see some of the aspects incorporated but never stated: testing of the clone when revived and disposal after 3 years. Today we are speculating that He3 mining on the moon could produce fusion energy in the future. I believe that was what the mining operation was doing, although not much was stated. It has several similarities to 2001, most have been listed. The most important one was that this was not an unreasonable science fiction with a long list of impossibilities, but rather a work which keeps within the realm of science fact, the way Arthur would have wanted it. The idea that they made the computer similar to HAL 9000 is not unreasonable. In fact I fully expect any NASA computer with the capabilities of the HAL 9000 to be named the same after the fictional work. The only thing I would have changed in the movie would be to show a glimpse of Sam viewing 2001 while on the space station.",10.0,nogodnomasters,2018/07/30,5,3
758,Ferris Bueller's Day Off,A dream for kids; a nightmare for adults.,"No matter how you try to put it, this will always be a teen movie, or at least a movie for people under the age of 25 who were recently in high school. It's premise is based on the human urge to go against the system and buck the rules and just have a good time. Practically every kid that feels stuck in the walls of an institution such as high school is going to get these urges, and for all of those kids, Ferris Bueller is their hero. Matthew Broderick brings a warm, innocent charm to the title role as a young man who has luck on his side. Everything goes his way, from worming his best friend (Alan Ruck) into taking his father's rare Ferrari, to warding off the high school principal (Jeffrey Jones) to getting his girlfriend (Mia Sara) out of school as well. Writer/director John Hughes takes his love for teenagers and school situations and gives us a story that deals with life outside school and the freedoms and privileges of being a kid. What Ferris does is, as they say, getting away with murder, but it is such a joy to watch him get into predicaments and wonder how can he possibly get out of this one. Broderick is a delight, as are the supporting cast, especially Jennifer Grey as his envious sister. This movie is about luck and what that power can do for you. It is also about enjoying life and the power that can do. It is the ultimate skipping school movie and is one of Hughes' best efforts as a writer and director. See it for the story, the funnies or the plain joy of skipping school and catching a glimpse of life.",8.0,bobsgrock,2009/04/19,3,2

760,Detachment,Powerful and thought provoking film,"¨A child's intelligent heart can fathom the depth of many dark places, but can it fathom the delicate moment of its own detachment? ¨ Detachment is a very interesting film although I wouldn't say it's entertaining. It raises a lot of questions and social issues without giving many answers, but it does make us aware of many problems that our society is facing when it comes to the educational system and parents lack of involvement in it. I thought Detachment was a beautiful film and despite it being a narrative it didn't seem like one; it is sort of poetic at times and has some great use of imagery. Adrian Brody is such a talented actor, and despite winning the Oscar for his brilliant work in The Pianist, I think he is very underrated in Hollywood. He is so good in this movie, and in my opinion it's his best performance since The Pianist. He was one of the reasons why I wanted to see this film; the other being that it was directed by Tony Kaye, the man responsible for American History X, which is on my list of favorite films. His films are powerful, thought provoking, and Detachment is not the exception. He can make memorable films although you wouldn't necessarily call them entertaining. In Detachment we are introduced to a very common problem: education. Kaye makes us wonder whether or not education is the teacher or parent's responsibility. Probably both, but unfortunately neither seem to be doing a great job and our society is losing its educational battle. Kids seem to find values somewhere else and base their self worth on what their friends think of them, meanwhile parents and teachers seem to do nothing about restoring their value. Parenting and teaching are great responsibilities, and as Brody says in one of his monologues in the movie there should be prerequisites to parenting and not anyone should be allowed too. Adrian Brody plays a substitute teacher, Mr. Barthes, who believes he has the perfect job because he doesn't have to carry the burden of identifying or carrying for his students. He can travel from one school to another. He is a lonely, quiet, and sad man who doesn't like attaching to anyone. He seems to have some disturbing memories about his past and doesn't like to talk about his problems so traveling from place to place is a good way to remain detached to society. His life will change when he gets his latest assignment at a very problematic school run by Principle Carol Dearden (Marcia Gay Harden). The students in this school give the teachers a very hard time and many of them seem to be going through a living hell. Mr. Barthes identifies with some of the teachers and students here. Mr. Seaboldt (James Caan), Ms. Madison (Christina Hendricks), Ms. Perkins (Blythe Danner), Mr. Wiatt (Tim Blake Nelson), and Dr. Doris Parker (Lucy Liu) are all part of the school faculty and all seem to be going through some sort of personal hardship. Mr. Barthes begins to identify himself with some of these people like Ms. Madison who seems as lonely as he is. He also begins to give special attention to one of his students named Meredith (Betty Kaye) who despite being talented doesn't really value herself. Another person who begins to influence Mr. Barthes is a young hooker named Erica (Sami Gayle) who he picks up from the street and begins to care for as a child. As much as Barthes wants to remain detached to people he begins to identify with many of them and without realizing it attaching to them. Detachment has a great cast. As I mentioned before this is Adrian Brody's best work since The Pianist, but I also have to give a lot of credit to young Sami Gayle who delivers a powerful performance as the lonely hooker who is taken advantage of and really has no self worth whatsoever. Director Kaye seems to raise this issue quite a bit since there are many characters who have little or no self value and in a way Brody's character tries to teach them that they have value and don't have to live based on the expectations or values given to them by others. James Caan and Christina Hendricks also give believable performances as part of the faculty. They are very different in character, but I think we all can identify them to some of the teachers we've had in the past. There are some very strong performances in this film and also some great dialogues. The script was written by first time screenwriter, Carl Lund, and it really is thought provoking. The imagery that Kaye uses is also very beautiful. There is a sense of claustrophobia as we see these long shots closing in on the school hallway, and emptiness when we see the abandoned classrooms. Detachment might not be an entertaining film you can watch with your friends, but it is a very interesting and thought provoking film. [URL]",8.0,estebangonzalez10,2012/08/05,5,4

Heck, even the characters from the blandest dime-a-dozen big-budget action film you can think of have more dimension and personality than the ones paraded across the screen here.

It's very funny, that's a cert. The performances are wonderful right across the board, and the dialogue's rarely less than excellent. Everyone plays their parts to perfection - it's a wonderful cast, and they're all on top form. It's the director's first feature, as far as i know, an he handles it competently enough, keeping things moving and flashing back and forth between the large cast with a good sense of timing and an instinct for piquing the viewer's interest. The thing that bugs me is the one aspect of the film that i'd felt certain of before i watched it -- the writing. Mark O Rowe's an excellent writer, but it seems in places that he sells a few characters short (especially when things get frantic towards the end). There were a few storythreads that i felt got a little short-changed in the rush to resolution. Having said that, there were tiny moments studded all through the film that back-handedly evoked genuine emotion. It was skillfully done, and in those small moments you knew you were watching the work of some very talented people, certainly not least of which was the writer. it's definitely a very, very good film, but i think if it had been allowed to end in a just ever-so-slightly messier way, it could have been a great one. Anyway, i'm nitpicking. if you see it you'll enjoy it. Oh, and i tried not to let this influence me too much, but I deeply, deeply fancy Kelly Mc Donald, so as far as i'm concerned, she's a serious plus point for this flick.

765,Taxi Driver,"Disturbing, powerful, relevant, important","A towering classic of American cinematic power. Martin Scorsese teams up with one of the most intense actors of that time to create a masterpiece of urban alienation. Paul Schrader's magnificent script paints a portrait of loneliness in the largest city of the world. Travis never once enters into a meaningful relationship with any character anywhere in the film. He is the most hopelessly alone person I've ever encountered on film. He is alone with his thoughts, and his thoughts are dark ones. The film fools you on a first viewing. Is Travis an endearing eccentric? Sure, he's odd, but he's so polite, and he's got a quirky sense of humor. His affection for Betsy is actually rather endearing. But on a second view, you see it for what it is. The audience comes to see Travis's psychosis gradually, but there's actually far less development than one might think. When he talks about cleaning up the city, the repeat viewer knows he doesn't mean some sort of Giuliani-facelift. This is less a film about a character in development as it is a kind of snapshot. To be sure, it takes the stimulus to provoke the response, but does that imply some kind of central change in the character? Tremendous supporting roles are brought to life through vivid performances by Keitel and Foster especially. Shepard's character, Betsy, is little more than a foil to highlight Travis's utter alienation from society, but she is still impeccably portrayed. With only two scenes that don't center on Travis, it is unavoidably De Niro's show. The life with which the supporting cast imbues their characters is a credit to themselves, and to the director's willingness to let the film develop from the intersection of diverse ideas and approaches. What would the plot lose by eliminating the Albert Brooks character (Tom)? Nothing at all. He makes almost no impact on Travis's life, which is where the plot lives. But his inclusion makes the film as a whole much richer and fuller. As a piece of American cinema history, this film will live forever. But far more important than that, this film will survive as a universal, ever-relevant examination of the workings of the alienated mind. The story doesn't end when the credits roll. We know Travis will snap again. But the story doesn't end with Travis either. It continues today in the cities and in the schools. The film is about the brutal power of the disaffected mind. This film didn't cause the incidents in Colombine, or Hawaii, or Seattle, or wherever you care to look, even with all of its disturbing images of violence. It didn't cause those things. It predicted them.",10.0,andrew7,1999/11/17,661,580
766,Detachment,Hopefully. people will see this with Vide On Demand,"I became curious about this film because I read where this film was Same Gayle's feature debut. I didn't know anything about this person other than her role on Blue Blood and that show limits her acting strength after seeing Detachment. Here was a film that Tony Kaye directed with an understatement that disguises the powerful argument for sterilization. The students have dissolved into disrespectful future parole violators and the parents, some of them, are the source of these problem children. And trying to ride that ship in turbulent waters in the Adrian Brody character. His attempts to settle those waters is a force of nature one man cannot do alone. But I don't know if he calms those waters following a tragedy or if all hell hits the place and that was a dream? I don't know how old Sami Gayle was when this role was filmed but her corrupt innocence is washed over as an abused prostitute. Her first time encounter with the Adrian Brody character isn't Pretty Woman, a film I hated for it's depiction of the happily ever after prostitute. Sami Gayle's prostitute had more realism to it. The only misgivings I had was that the audience never got to know the results from her medical test. Perhaps it was edited out for time. And the teachers were excellent. I saw where Adrian Brody was the producer for this project. He pulled some top notched actors that made this work. James Caan , Lucy Lui, Marsha Gay Harden, Christine Hendricks, the other guy who held on to the chain link fence, all were good. And while watching this, you had the feeling that some student might go off on the deep end and that was predictable and not unexpected but it was done with the right tempo and uniqueness, no gun play. And I saw where it didn't do well at the box office. Well, with video on demand, I hope this avenue will work out for them so that more eyes can watch this exceptionally independent film.",9.0,twotrybe,2015/03/20,2,2

It lacks the character development in the first one, doesn't have the same life as the first one and the premise is not as entertaining. Horrible bosses 2 has some laughs, it is an entertaining movie but it is just average, nothing special. By no means it is a bad movie, it will keep you entertained and bring some laughter but nothing else.

768,Crash,"This movies shows that we are not born with prejudices, we learn them","People are born with good hearts, but they grow up and learn prejudices. ""Crash"" is a movie that brings out bigotry and racial stereotypes. The movie is set in Los Angeles, a city with a cultural mix of every nationality. The story begins when several people are involved in a multi-car accident. From that point, we are taken back to the day before the crash, seeing the lives of several characters, and the problems each encounters during that day. An LAPD cop (Matt Dillon) is trying to get medical help for his father, but he is having problems with a black HMO clerk who won't give his father permission to see another doctor. He in turn takes out his frustration on a black couple during a traffic stop. A socialite (Sandra Bullock) and District Attorney (Brandon Fraser) are carjacked at gunpoint by two black teenagers. Sandra takes out her anger on a Mexican locksmith who is changing the door locks to their home. Later that night, the locksmith is again robbed of his dignity by a Persian store-owner. Many of the characters switch from being bad-person-to-hero in ways that may surprise you. This is one movie you must see for yourself, but you can't go to the movie thinking that you will escape life for 2 hours. ""Crash"" forces the viewer to confront racism in the real world. You may take a look at yourself and examine your own preconceptions about race, and see if you are prejudiced. The depth of the performances by all the actors was brilliant. I think the movie will receive several Academy Award nominations. (Lions Gate Film, Run time 1:40, Rated R) (10/10)",10.0,the-movie-guy,2005/05/05,229,119

771,Ferris Bueller's Day Off,"Take the ""Day Off""...","Before all the slapstick, before re-writing ""Home Alone"" umpteen times and before selling his soul to ""Disney Pictures Inc."", John Hughes was believed to be THE scribe for teen angst. He wrote eloquently of it in ""Sixteen Candles"", ""The Breakfast Club"" and ""Pretty in Pink"". And with ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"", he creates a person and a time in life that just about anyone who's ever been a teenager can relate to. Who hasn't known someone like Ferris Bueller (Broderick)? Someone who always has a plan, someone who made loafing off an art form, someone who could fall in a barrel of you-know-what and come out smelling like a rose? All he wants to do is take a day off from school and enjoy the day in Chicago - simple enough, but he must also try and convince his best friend Cameron (Ruck) and his best girl (Sara) to join him and, in the process, learn to enjoy what life has to offer. Naturally, there is a tyrannical school dean (Jones) who is determined to catch Ferris in the act of hookey and Ferris' own sister (Grey, pre-nose job) who has it in for her brother, the ""trouser-snake"". There are funny situations throughout the movie, and the characters are ones that grow on you, especially Ruck's worry-wart portrayal of Cameron Frye, constantly fretting about his dystalic, cursing his father and nearly drowning in a pool, all in the name of friendship. Sara has less to do, but she plays the object of desire well, and Ferris' passion for her is understandable. At least he thinks about the right things, like what their lives would be like after high school. All the way from beginning to end, this movie is a great trip in search of fun, relaxation, not taking life too seriously and how to sing Wayne Newton songs in the middle of a parade. You want to catch vintage John Hughes and classic '80s teendom at its best? Seize this ""Day""! Ten stars for ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"".",10.0,Mister-6,2000/09/06,258,210
772,Primal Fear,"Part Brilliant Mind Game, Part Courtroom Antics","Primal Fear (1996) Part Mind Game, Part Courtroom Antics A fast paced film with Richard Gere in the kind of role he does best (an arrogant lawyer) and with Edward Norton in a startling performance as a potential criminal worth the admission alone. That there are familiar tricks and tropes and a subplot of almost no significance might be expected--it's not a great film by any measure--but it's packaged well and never flags. There are some secondary characters who don't quite click into the film, mainly the opposing lawyer played by Laura Linney, who can be really good. The law office sidekick (Andre Braugher) is thin, the psychologist (Frances McDormand) is strong enough but has a canned role, and the tough and predictably evil politician (John Mahoney) all keep the film in the box. These are talented people, so maybe we can shift to the direction by Gregory Hoblit, as able as it is, failing to make the movie first rate, depending on surface effects and following a plot line that is just a variant on other plot lines. In fact, Hoblit's creds to this point are a few high quality television episodes, and there is a feel of an overblown NYPD Blue or something to this movie. But there remains one main twist, pulled off brilliantly, brilliantly, by Norton, Gere in tow. It's a completely enjoyable trip, if your expectations are in line.",7.0,secondtake,2009/07/26,4,4
773,Crash,Crash DID NOT deserve to EVEN BE NOMINATED FOR BEST PICTURE!,"Okay, it was very good...but Best Picture? Please, not even close. Munich was better, Capote was much better, Good Night and Good Luck was much better...Brokeback Mountain - well, that should have won! The Academy voters seem to act like the current day Democrats - please just a little of everyone, but don't dare take any concrete positions. That's why we have a complete moron in office in the US. This has been the WORST AA presentation ... and forget 1987 ... since way before that. Hollywood is so afraid of it's bottom line, that it can't be set ""straight"". Many voters apparently didn't even see Brokeback Mountain. Get real and get with it. This was the most pathetic year since I have been watching in the mid- 60's and I was only two. Wake up, whoever you are. Hollywood IS mainstream, and that's what happened to the Box Office in 2005. King Kong, the last Star Wars film, another Batman film, a re-make or whatever of Charlie and The Chocolate Factory, and much more to come in 2006. At least there were original best pictures, i.e. Munich, but heard that one before, Capote - great; Katherine Keener should have won, even though now we know Reese can sing like a Cash/Carter, etc., Syriana was a much better picture than Crash. That film has been done, since the early 1960's and we have to make that the best film? What a horrible Oscar night and a horrible year to end with in 2005 and another boring year in 2006. At least the BAFTA for best picture went to Brokeback, and what about the horrible song that won? Pathetic. I think we only have about 20 years left as America or the USA, before someone comes in and changes up things a bit. Maybe it will be China since they own so much of this country ... or India, because they have all the high-tech jobs and are the largest democratic country in the entire world. America has become the land of the fat, the pathetic, and the stupid. Trash can be found in more places than Florida, West Virgina, South Dakota, and in the mid-West.

774,The Chorus,We're back to Europe;France: Music,"I had some kind of a movie lesson after watching ""Les Choristes"". One person was telling me what I should always know when I'm going to write about a movie, what I should care about, what I should investigate and other things. She was right, in mostly everything she said, but she was harsh on me. Of the people I know, I'm the only one I know who stays watching film credits; but I don't write all of the credits in a piece of paper instantly, you see? ""Les Choristes"" is a film with great spirit, carefully written, directed, composed and edited, that only fails to be great itself because of its trashed argument and its predictable plot line. Taken from the story of an old film written by various screenwriters, director Christophe Barratier and partner Philippe Lopes-Curval adapted the story about a teacher who arrives at a school and somehow changes the students' lives. Professor Clément Mathieu must be a very well known character in France. It has been the main element of some movies and it is a peculiar person. He is portrayed here by Gérard Jugnot, probably as respectable now as any other actor who played the character before. Jugnot directed ""Monsieur Batignole"", a movie I never saw but many people talk about. I have explained my little culture about European cinema before, but I'm reading and writer Lopes-Curval has worked in a lot of the films Jugnot has directed. So I figure that the latter one knows the words and the way of writing of the first one by heart, and he speaks with the right tone and look that translate that to the viewer. Jugnot and his professor are the film's attraction; so was Robin Williams in ""Dead Poets Society"" and more recently Kevin Kline in ""The Emperor's Club"" or Julia Roberts in the very feminine ""Mona Lisa Smile"". But Of the movies mentioned, two were about learning poetry and human qualities, the other one about learning art; ""Les Choristes"" is about learning music. It's just a matter of time before the students who don't like the principal Rachin (a flawless François Berléand), become fond of Mathieu, the new teacher. And it's also a matter of time before Mathieu discovers that his kids can sing and decides to train them to form a choir (I was watching ""Sister Act 2"" the other day and I recalled the situation). Mathieu used to be a songwriter, so the choir becomes good and they make a presentation in the school, and although the director doesn't approve it, they achieve their goal. However, they don't go to a competition where they can win or loose, because this is a more personal story, and its resolution is personal. The environment is practically one and Barratier makes it beautiful and ugly when he wants to. It's a remarkable fact that Barratier himself also wrote the music and lyrics of the beautiful songs, and that the child actors are members of an existent and, as I heard, very respected choir (probably the best). It's a must see, because of the music mainly, and the rest is up to each individual.",7.0,jpschapira,2006/06/04,2,1
775,The Chorus,A Choral Music Teacher's review (with SPOILERS - be forewarned!),"As a certified choral music teacher, I want to add my $.02 regarding this film. I, personally, very much enjoyed it. It illustrated extremely well the positive effects of music in students' lives (discipline problems minimizing, self-confidence rising, and just making a child happy to find an activity they enjoy pursuing). Watching Mathieu conduct the first set of choral warm-ups as well as teaching Morhange proper posture made me smile, as these are familiar teaching tools to choral directors. What made this different from a film like ""Mr. Holland's Opus"" is that the movie didn't end with a large concert attended by an audience of supportive,crying parents/students in honor of Mr. Mathieu. In ""The Chorus,"" Mr. Mathieu was fired from his job and went on to teach music privately for the remainder of his life. The cheesy, typical American style which would have the film end with a swelling orchestral score as the aforementioned concert audience stand to cheer/cry with joy would certainly evoke an immediate emotional response. However, this is an example of Hollywood being Hollywood. It's impossible to NOT get emotional when Mr. Holland hears his orchestral composition performed for the first time at a retirement concert in his honor. Hell, I got verklempt seeing that. But, sadly, it simply doesn't happen that way. ""The Chorus"" illustrates this well with it's unpretentious take on the life of a struggling musician trying to make it as a teacher. The following is what happens to a large majority of vocal music professionals with big aspirations - they end up teaching full/part-time in a college/university setting, a school system, or give private lessons in a very humble manner, occasionally finding a chance to compose a small work for a local event and/or sing in a local opera/choir/musical/etc., without any fanfare. Those who DO go on to perform professionally almost ALWAYS say, ""Well, I wouldn't be able to do this without working as a teacher/professor. That's where all professional singers start."" These people teach for years, often touching the lives of students in countless numbers of ways, then retire to live a simple, quiet life. He/she will get a 'Thank You' from a few students and maybe some parents, but beyond that, not much else. For most, as they look back on their careers, they are generally happy to have had opportunities to teach young people the magic of music as well as feel that magic themselves as the occasional performer/composer. Music teachers can also identify with some situations in this film. Who could forget when Mondain was hauled away and Mathieu leans out the window and says, ""...but he was my only baritone."" As much as Mathieu despised this ill-behaved hellion, he was, in fact, his only baritone for the choir, leaving Mathieu somewhat disappointed when he left. Also, the attitude regarding music in the eyes of some school administrators (i.e. Mr. Rachin in the case of the film) should not be foreign to many music educators. The music program is deemed completely unimportant and unnecessary UNTIL it is noticed as a success and a delight - only then does the administrator praise and announce his 100% support for the music program - and, of course, claim the program as his brainchild. I wish I could show this in a classroom. There are, however, a few crude scenes which make this impossible. The only reason why I gave this a 9 out of 10 is that the 'action' began to slow a bit towards the last 1/3 of the film. I found myself losing focus as the month of May rolled around in the film. To comment on what another member said regarding the music skills coming about too fast. Do remember that this film takes place over several months, with progress not seen until the Spring. This is not atypical and not unusual at all. With an inspiring, determined teacher, and daily rehearsals with implementations/consistent enforcing of 'good singing habits' (all of which the boys had in the film), true quality can be seen over a span of a few months. The progress of the boys singing skills in the film was, therefore NOT so unrealistic. In my opinion, every music educator should see this film - especially if one is in the choral music field. It is inspirational without being pretentious and, well shmaltzy. It's a much more true-to-life portrayal of the ups and downs of a music teacher with hopes of something bigger. Those not in the music field who are perhaps used to over-the-top portrayals such as ""Mr. Holland's Opus"" may not find themselves giving the film a standing ovation.",9.0,jg178200,2005/09/06,18,16

It's not a big thought provoking masterpiece made on a shoestring nor is it an ensemble piece featuring the best of the worlds acting talent. It's just an 80's teen movie featuring a cast of 'B'-list talent and a good idea. What would you do if you had one day in which anything was possible. In which ignoring the rules and regulations that bind the rest of us poor mortals was all part of the fun. It's one of those movies you see when you're a kid and you wish so much that you could do the same thing, take a Ferrari, your girlfriend, best mate and a wad of cash and enjoy all the guilty pursuits you can in one day. It's the perfect fantasy movie and demands constant screenings in order to fully appreciate its brilliance, its glorious simplicity. And the characters are a joy to behold, the carefree Ferris, uptight Principal, tightly wound sister and friend and completely ignorant parents. After seeing it you'll wish your school days were so much fun and the ending is surprisingly touching.

779,The Green Mile,"Fell asleep towards the end, and I don't think it was an accident.","There are some times when I can say that I must have seen a truly different film than the vast majority of other people in the world. This time is one of them. For this film to be rated so highly, is completely bewildering to me. Let me just say that I am by no means some kind of American working class slob who can only sit through a 90 minute action-packed popcorn film loaded special fx and t&a. I can easily sit through films like Barry Lyndon and 2001 without even getting up for a snack. If a film is truly great, it will hold my attention. If it isn't, then I may just doze off. At least I was interested enough to rewind it when I woke up to see what I missed. It wasn't worth the effort. This film failed on almost every level to connect or convey any true emotion to me. The only character I liked was Michael Clarke Duncan as a Christ-like figure who has exceptional healing powers, but is put to death for a crime he didn't commit. The film is slow, talky, and not very well-acted. This was truly surprising since the cast members of this film are usually quite good. Tom Hanks stars as a guard in charge of the death row wing of on old southern prison. Through most of the film, we see him and the other guards interacting with the prisoners and carrying out an execution here and there. Tom Hanks gives one of the worst performances I've ever seen him give. The only emotion he shows at all is agony while trying to pass a stone through his urethra! Yes, a major plot point in this film is that Hanks is having trouble urinating! Whatever. As far as the other characters go, nobody does that well in the acting department. David Morse, Barry Pepper, and James Cromwell have boring characters. The individuals who play the bad guard and the psychotic prisoner over-act badly. Michael Jeter's character is so annoying that I couldn't wait to see him executed. His execution scene is perhaps the most memorable scene in the film. And the part with the little mouse! Way too cutesy for words. I thought I was watching Stuart Little for a moment. And not to spoil the conclusion or anything, but there is absolutely no payoff for anything we've learned throughout the film. I at least was hoping the ending would tie everything up in a thoughtful manner that would somehow make the whole experience rewarding. Nope! Overall, this film is a dud. I really can't see where all the hype came from. Do yourself a favor and stick with Shawshank instead.

It does have all the right ingredients for a fantastic movie (funny characters, nice animation etc.), but somehow it does not quite seem to work.

On the contrary, it's a very depressing movie but its message is clear: proper education and helping the others without asking for much in return is the only way to make sure we are going to have a good future. The story is about a substitute teacher who ends up at a school with difficult students (similar to Dangerous Minds) but he connects with the students by showing them that he is broken and helpless just like that. There is also another plot line with a young prostitute and how their relationship develops and begin to trust each other. I highly recommend this movie but keep in mind that it is not a happy film.

This is just a movie, but in real life the press has also the power to turn a good man in ""the bad guy"". The other thing that I loved in the movie was the combination of the psychological with the physical aspects, where the first ones overcome the second, like regular people. The mind will always defeat the body and super heroes are no exception. The end couldn't be better, super hero or not, he has also his needs that can't be ignored.

783,Blackfish,Well it's definitely eye-opening,"No matter where you stand on the subject of captivity, you won't be happy with SeaWorld after seeing ""Blackfish"". I'm not against captivity in general, but there were some serious blunders on behalf of the organization, and the problem still hasn't been resolved. One of the trainers in the film gave the obvious reason as to why Tilikum (the killer whale at the heart of this thing) is still performing: he's a very profitable breeder. But that definitely doesn't hold water (no pun intended) after he killed a trainer and made cable news stardom four years ago. I would've thought the fervor and backlash since this documentary's release would finally make something happen, but apparently that wasn't enough. We're talking about an animal who was abused by the other penned whales in his formative years, and harbors a great deal of aggression as a result. And he's still performing? Some of the material shown here is genuinely sad: a mother orca crying out for her separated young; Tilikum's abuse from other penned orcas; and some of the footage of the incidents (some of which - deeply unsettling - is amateur park visitor footage). The one thing I really wanted to see is an interview with Ken Peters, the trainer who was dragged down into the water by an overzealous whale. He's still alive after the scary incident, and I'd love to know his views on this. As for how ""Blackfish"" stands on its own, it's a polished, well-produced documentary that remains highly watchable. But it seems wholly absorbed in its ""anti-captivity"" argument, and that can be somewhat of a turn-off. Regardless, it expertly plays on the emotions of its audience, and it does invite the wary eye towards SeaWorld's animal maintenance procedures. No matter where you stand on this, ""Blackfish"" is one bummer of a movie. 7/10",7.0,Mr-Fusion,2014/03/24,3,3

It's not that I don't respect those who like fine art. I do. But personally, I lack the sophistication or training to appreciate the makeup or sets or choreography if the plot is awful and the characters unlikeable. That's what gets in my way when I watch Goodfellas, which I've seen twice now but couldn't get through it the 2nd time. The protagonists are nasty and I couldn't identify with them. This is the same thing that turned me off watching ""Pulp Fiction"". Superb acting, story, some real drama -- but how ugly and why would I want to watch this? Who should see this film: -- art types / drama lovers: a must-see -- action movie types who don't mind when the protagonist is violent and awful Sorry, but at least I've stated some real reasons for giving Goodfellas only a 4 out of 10.",4.0,johnnymonsarrat,2002/05/27,32,14

It starred Robert De Niro as the lonely and insomniac Travis Bickle, who is sick of his surroundings. He takes a job as a taxi driver due to always being up during the night and it leads to many interesting events. Robert De Niro did an excellent job as Travis Bickle isn't an easy character to play. I really felt that Travis was a real person and that everyone can relate to him when it comes to loneliness. Jodie Foster (Iris) and Harvey Keitel (Sport) did a good job considering the characters they portrayed were not easy to play as well. Wizard, played by Peter Boyle was a cool guy and I would've liked to have seen more of him. The cinematography was awesome as there were some great shots of the city. I especially loved the overhead shot when Travis was on the phone. The music score was terrific and I liked how it started off jazzy and romantic but when Travis gets rejected by Betsy it becomes dark and violent. Great way for the music to set the tone of the film as it was split up into two different moods. I loved the line ""you talkin' to me"" and the impact it's had. Very iconic line! Overall, I'll give ""Taxi Driver"" a 9/10. Terrific movie! Only reason I'm not giving it a 10 is because of the ending. I felt it to be a bit flat but other than that everything was perfect.",9.0,Ryan_9,2020/06/01,7,5

792,Pulp Fiction,"Always has been, and always will be a personal favourite","Perhaps before I start talking about why I think Pulp Fiction works on so many levels, I should mention briefly how I came to watch the film. Pulp Fiction was a film I had heard of at a very young age, and I'm not quite sure why. I had also wanted to see it for a very long time- again, I'm not quite sure why. Maybe the mere fact that it was R-rated and notorious for its violence perked the interest of my 14-year-old self. Nevertheless, I got round to watching it about a month before my 15th birthday- incredibly late at night on an occasion where I found myself home alone. I recall being blown away by the film, but also somewhat overwhelmed and confused. I had never seen anything like it before, and walked away from it being kinda sure I'd enjoyed it. I couldn't say for sure though. Still feeling curious about the film, and the many mysteries relating to it that I'd failed to determine on my first viewing, I re-watched the film just a couple of months later. And something just clicked for me- I fell in love with the film. Everything about the movie suddenly worked for me, and I found the second viewing to be perhaps the shortest two and a half hours of my life I've ever experienced. My own sense of time was warped and bended to the extent that it was in the film itself. That very night it somehow became one of the greatest things I had ever watched; one of the only films I'd seen that I barely hesitated to call a masterpiece. Since then I've watched it another six or seven times- almost once a year- and I continue to feel motivated to watch it because I honestly feel like I get something new out of it each time I watch it. Spoilers ahead, by the way. I plan to get fairly in-depth with my review of this movie, so just a warning for those that haven't seen it. One of the great things about Pulp Fiction is its refusal to fall under any particular genre or category of movies. It feels like a comedy when Jules and Vince discuss fast food and foot massages for nearly ten minutes It feels like a thriller during several segments, notably the scene where Mia overdoses on heroin and the climactic Mexican stand-off in the restaurant- two sequences that would have even Alfred Hitchcock on the edge of his seat. The crime genre is represented through the character's actions- most of the cast are criminals in one way or another, whether they murder, steal, or take generous helpings of class-A drugs. The infamous gimp scene feels straight out of a horror movie. This collage of various movie genres is one of the things that makes the movie stand out- by themselves, certain scenes may feel familiar, but when they're all blended together so well like they are in Pulp Fiction, the end product ends up feeling unique. This is true for most of Quentin Tarantino's films- he borrows elements from different genres, and homages/ references dozens of older movies in order to create something that feels unique, even if most of the individual elements themselves aren't too original. I can see why some people may not be a fan of the fact Tarantino essentially steals from the lesser known works of those who came before him, but for me, I love it- I think he just makes it work due to the fact that his encyclopaedic knowledge of film allows him to borrow from so many sources. If he simply referenced about a half dozen or less films for each one of his movies, then I think that would start to feel like plagiarism. Now, I could go on about the acting, the screenplay, the direction, and the glorious soundtrack, but really, what's there to say about these elements of the film that haven't already been said? Tarantino's screenplay is one of the most acclaimed and quoted from the past couple of decades, and deservedly won him his first Oscar. His direction has been similarly praised, and the soundtrack has become iconic- most impressive of all is that Tarantino chose music that goes so well with the images they accompany. And yes, the acting is phenomenal- the film features what is almost certainly Samuel L. Jackson's best performance, one of Bruce Willis' most interesting performances of his long and successful career, and some great work from Uma Thurman. Even the supporting actors are memorable, including Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, and Ving Rhames as Marsellus Wallace (who's arguably the film's main character- think about it; without him, none of the three main stories would exist- Butch ripped off Marsellus Wallace, Vince took out Wallace's girlfriend on a date that eventually went horribly wrong, and Vince and Jules were assigned to retrieve the mysterious briefcase for Wallace). And of course, who can forget that Pulp Fiction single-handedly made John Travolta cool again- an absolutely monumental achievement. Of course Travolta did eventually succeed in making himself a joke again a few years later when he made Battlefield Earth, but that's another story (or perhaps better left for another review)? As I said, I could indulge in commenting on these areas of the film, but if you've seen the movie you probably already know how good they are. Pulp Fiction is also one of the most discussed film's of the past 20 years, so you've likely already come across reviews or rabid Tarantino fans who've gushed about why the film works so well, and how fantastic all the various components of the film are. So instead, I'm going to backtrack back to my point about seeing something new in the film upon every new viewing, and explain what I took away from the movie on my most recent viewing. Pulp Fiction was always controversial for its violence, with some criticising its depiction of assaults, shootings, beatings, and exploding heads. But for me, I found the film to have an almost anti-violence message of sorts, and I only realised this on my most recent viewing. Now bear with me, because I know that sounds like a somewhat ridiculous claim, but I have my reasons. Pulp Fiction may be violent, but it doesn't promote violence. Sure, the violence may be somewhat stylised and at times over the top, but that doesn't mean the film is saying that violence is something trivial. Violent acts in the film are often shown to have consequences for those that commit them. Vince's carelessness with his gun- an instrument of violence- causes Marvin's head to be blown off in the backseat of Jules' car, which leads to a near twenty minute detour in which they must take the car to Jimmy's house and consult ""The Wolf"" to assist them in cleaning the car and disposing of the gory evidence. Marsellus' desire to get revenge on Butch by presumably killing him leads them both to the basement of the rednecks- indeed, they are both fighting each other in the redneck's store when they are taken captive. But in the climax of the film, where guns are being pointed at several characters in the middle of a tense Mexican stand-off, not a single bullet is fired. One would expect the tension to be eventually broken and the bullets to start flying, especially if one has seen some of Taratino's other movies that end in explosive and violent climaxes (see Reservoir Dogs, Inglorious Basterds, Death Proof, Django Unchained, and Kill Bill Volume 1). But instead, Jules, who we've seen to be ruthless and unafraid to kill earlier in the movie, believes himself to be a changed man after miraculously surviving a hail-storm of bullets from a criminal that looks a little like Jerry Seinfeld and so instead decides to defuse the situation peacefully. He talks down Pumpkin and Honey-Bunny from killing or robbing anyone, and insists that his dim-witted associate Vince refrain from hurting anyone too. He delivers an absolutely stunning monologue where he ponders the bible reading he quoted so confidently earlier in the movie, and it's damn-near poetic. It sends a shiver up my spine every time I watch that scene, and indeed, Jules' speech works. The two robbers get up after Jules gives them some money from his famous wallet, and then leave. Jules and Vince do the same a few moments later. Not a shot is fired. No one is killed. It's an absolutely beautiful scene. It may have been tempting for Tarantino to give the film a ""Wild Bunch-esque"" ending, but instead he refrained, and I'm glad he did so. The climax to Pulp Fiction is absolutely stunning- fifteen minutes of tension, almost poetic dialogue, and brilliant acting, especially from Samuel L. Jackson. And it took me seven viewings just to notice how beautifully peaceful the ending of the film was. And that's why it's my favourite film of all time- I get new meaning from it, or appreciate different areas of it every-time I watch it. If you've never seen Pulp Fiction before, I implore you to go watch it. And if you have seen Pulp Fiction before, I implore you to go watch it again.",10.0,Jeremy_Urquhart,2020/04/20,8,7
793,Taxi Driver,Let's taxi to the Dark Side of Life,"Essential film to watch. Director Martin Scorsese, and Screenwriter Paul Schrader shows a life full of private fear, emptiness, and loneliness in 'Taxi Driver'. Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) is that Taxi Driver, a Vietnam Vet whom seldom speak whom drifts in and out of 1970's New York City wicked night life. He witness a lot of wrongs and faults in civilization by how the people act around him. Robert De Niro character is similar to Don Quixote and Dostoyevsky's ''Idiot''. He is a good man trapped in an evil and sick world ,the difference with Travis is that he gets through it by becoming even more vicious than the world of slime, he inhabits whereas Quixote remains delusional and dies and the 'idiot' goes insane. He slowly growing tired of it, and losing hope and looks for a way out. These supporting cast ''way out' are Betsie and Iris. (Cybil Sheppard & Jolie Foster). Both being symbolic of Travis having a madonna/whore complex somewhat. Betsie is a campaign volunteer for Sentaor Charles Palantine (Leonard Harris) who is running for President.. Iris is a 12-year-old child prostitute who is attempting to escape her pimp Matthew 'Sport' (Harvey Keitel) who he becomes obsessed with helping her return to her parents' home, sending her money to do so and a letter in which he states he will soon be dead. Disgusted by the street crime, politics and prostitution that he witnesses through the city, Travis finds a focus for his frustration and begins a program of intense physical training and shaving his head into a mohawk as he become a weapon for violence. The scary underlying concept in the movie that many overlook is that Travis Bickle is the manifestation of America of the 1970s. A confused society recovering from the failed war in Vietnam, from poverty of the working-class, from racism towards blacks, from drug addiction, and from mental illness. Bickle has adopted the confused mix of the military values of militancy, honor, and chivalry (his initial modest courtship of Betsy) with sexual perversion, racism, and disillusionment with society. The ending of the movie can be interpreted in many ways. Was Travis a hero or villain? Did he die or live? Some people might not like the movie, due to the sexual and racist undertones in the film, the violence, and the cursing. Taxi Driver is and will always be a disturbing film, however it's thought provoking and now there is a lot of depth to be seen in this very critical film. It's an experiment, NOT entertainment, only vaguely art. It presents no solutions, promotes despair, and really is a glorification of violence, and of the filmmakers own self conscious congratulations of himself on his own daring. It's a experiment of the mind.",8.0,ironhorse_iv,2012/11/17,4,3
794,The Wailing,Impressive build up to...,"I'm not going to mention any specifics about the plot or characters at all, but I do discuss the general orientation of the ending. (ie. Stop reading if you think general might still be spoiling). I so much want to give this movie an 8 or 9 out of 10. The acting was strong (especially from the child actor); the scenery and both overall setting and specific settings for particular scenes helped set just the right mood at the right time; there was a good dip into traditional local customs; and running alongside the plot were several themes related to important social and moral concerns (racism being the biggest one). A powerful combination. But, what really caught me and held me throughout the movie was the mystery. Multiple characters and events would lead you to suspect the antagonist was a particular person or thing, just before something lead you in a different direction. At many points, you have two or more suspicions and are just waiting to confirm which is right. Thoroughly engaging despite the length of the movie. And then, in the last 5-10 minutes, when you are waiting for all the strings to pull together... waiting for that 'aha' moment... waiting for the climax... Nothing really happens. You're left with a vague ending; half your suspicions thrown to the wind, rather than tidied up; and some extra strings (most of which don't fit with the rest of the plot) tossed on top just to keep you more confused. What was 95% a highly intriguing thriller/mystery of a horror story, died a horrible death in the 5% art-house that was the ending. Ultimately, a terrible movie that I could not recommend to anyone.",4.0,heath-jeffrey,2016/07/30,183,98
795,Hotel Transylvania,Hotel Transylvania Review,"Dracula (voiced by Adam Sandler) is the owner and creator of Hotel Transylvania, a five-star resort where the world's monsters can be safe from human civilization. Dracula invites some of the most famous monsters like Frankenstein's Monster (Kevin James) and his wife Eunice (Fran Drescher), Murray the Mummy (Cee Lo Green), Wayne and Wanda Werewolf (Steve Buscemi and Molly Shannon), Griffin the Invisible Man (David Spade), Bigfoot, The Blob, and other monsters to celebrate the 118th birthday of his daughter Mavis (voiced by Selena Gomez). However, Mavis prefers to explore the outside world with her father's permission, but the village he directs her to is actually an elaborate deception to convince her of the threat of humans enough to coax her back. However, this charade inadvertently attracts the attention of an ordinary young traveler named Jonathan (voiced by Andy Samberg) who was exploring the surrounding forest and he follows the staff to the hotel. Once Jonathon enters the hotel, Dracula frantically attempts to hide him from the patrons such as disguising him as a Flesh Golem named Johhny-stein with the later hasty cover story of being a relative of one of Frank's body parts. Eventually, Jonathan is discovered by Mavis and company, forcing Dracula to claim he is going to arrange Mavis' birthday party with a young perspective. In doing so, Jonathan manages to liven up the staid activities at the hotel, charming everyone, especially Mavis. Eventually, even Dracula begins to like the human, taking him into his confidence about his family's traumatic past after the vampire notices the young man knows something about them in a respectful manner. Unfortunately, Chef Quasimodo (Jon Lovitz) realizes Jonathan is human and captures him to cook him, forcing Dracula to directly intervene by magically paralyzing the chef. Eventually, the birthday party happens and it is a raucous success until Dracula overreacts to Mavis and Jonathan's innocent kiss. Things get worse when Chef Quasimodo interrupts the party and reveals Jonathan's true nature. Even as the clientèle are revolted, Dracula, in his ranting, lets it slip that he tricked Mavis at the fake village and Mavis is outraged at being so manipulated by her own father. For his part, Jonathan feels obliged to reject Mavis for her father's sake and leaves the hotel. Afterward, Dracula realizes that in his efforts to protect Mavis, he has broken her heart and now she tearfully wants to stay at the hotel forever. Wishing to undo his mistake, Dracula persuades his friends to help him find Jonathan and even risks his destruction by venturing out in the daylight to do so. Learning that Jonathan is about to board a flight out of Transylvania Airport shortly, they race on and enter a town en route. At that town, Dracula and company are stunned to see the humans celebrating a monster holiday with many humans costumed as the monsters in tribute. To clear a path, Frankenstein tries to scare them, but finds the humans are cheerfully welcoming them instead and even provide a shaded route through the town for Dracula to proceed at maximum speed. However, Dracula finds that he is too late with Jonathan's plane taking off. With no alternative, Dracula desperately flies after it in broad daylight without knowing he is being burned. With maximum effort, Dracula manages to reach the plane and resorts to mind-controlling one of the pilots to tell Jonathan that he wants him to return to be with his daughter and manipulates the plane back to the airport. Later, Dracula returns Jonathan to Mavis and gives his blessing to their relationship and the hotel has another party to celebrate his daughter's liberating coming of age before setting off on their travels. This movie was just decent nothing to write home about i do not however like the reviews this movie is getting the ending song was just awkward the techno style they were going with for it just didn't sound right it toke the film a while to really start the twilight bashing part was very much needed! the backstory of monsters seeing humans as the villains was actually really creative there are a few bathroom jokes that you can get past but there's not that much adult jokes all in all the movie was decent it had fun characters,great visuals,brilliant voice actors but it felt to much like a Saturday morning cartoon with its soundtrack and score and visuals but i guess thats what director Genndy Tartovosky is used to having created Dexter's Laboratory and such overall it wasn't what i was expecting but it was a OK movie",7.0,jimmygarnhum,2012/09/29,3,2

800,October Sky,One of the best movies I've ever seen.,"OCTOBER SKY is a great, great movie. I would consider it to be one of the best dramas ever made. Perhaps even one of the best movies ever made in any genre. This is the true story of four boys in a coal mining town that, instead of growing up to become coal miners like their fathers, they want to do something more. They want to make something of themselves. Inspired by the launch of the first Sputnik, the four boys set out to create their own rocket and win the county science fair to win themselves scholarships. OCTOBER SKY wins on every level. Humor, drama, a little action, some romance (not very much). I really enjoy movies of this caliber. While it wasn't a very big hit in theaters, it was still one of the best movies that I have ever seen so far in my life. I saw this movie in science class, because we are learning about the creation of rockets ourselves, but I didn't really pay much attention to the building of the rocket, it was more the feel and sadness of the film. It is truely a great movie to watch with or without your family. It is good either way. After I am done writing this, I am going to watch it again. I just thought it best to write my review before I see it in friggen wide-screen format on my DVD. I seriously cannot see how people can enjoy watching movies on wide-screen. It takes away half of the screen! What the hell is up with that? And people say its better? Some people are just really stupid. But, here's hoping that the great feel of the movie will keep me happy and keep me from not moaning about it. If you like this movie, I also recommend THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, THE GREEN MILE, STAND BY ME, THE MAJESTIC, THE LEGEND OF BAGGER VANCE,and HEARTS IN ATLANTIS. 5/5 for all of those including OCTOBER SKY.",10.0,Jack the Ripper1888,2002/04/27,20,14

Would that every person allowed into the space where the minds of young people are cultivated were screened and tested for the 'right stuff'. I think the most horrific, terrifying documentary about the tragedy of wasted school lives should be shown to every young person who sets foot in the classroom - because nothing else seems to get through to them. Every single person alive needs a sense of worth and hope and destination. I thank God that I found this before I became another teenage suicide statistic. My own children have seen the value of this and have adopted it for themselves.

All performances are wonderful (especially those of Matthew Broderick and Edie McClurg as Grace and my personal favorite, Jennifer Grey). Ferris contains some truly unforgettable one-liners (most of which are spoken by Grey). The facial and physical actions of all the different characters are also a riot. From the sick in bed scene, to the boring teachers, to the snooty restaurant, FBDO, never loses it's comic momentum. John Hughes has truly capture the spirit of every coming of age teenager, in this film, which I've seen dozens of times. It's one of those classics which just never gets old.

805,Goodfellas,"As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster...","To be frank, ""Goodfellas"" is probably the best crime movie ever made. It is more than just a movie; it tells a captivating tale; it is perfectly cast; Scorsese's direction is at its utmost brilliance. In fact, I'd venture to say that ""Goodfellas"" far surpasses what Francis Ford Coppola's much-loved ""The Godfather"" has to offer. In the first place, the entire sympathy for the characters of ""The Godfather"" depended on portraying them more as a dysfunctional family. This is not what a crime film should be. A crime film should be about *crime*, not men in tight suits pledging loyalty to each other. The characters of ""Goodfellas"" are, above all, gangsters. As a matter of fact, one of the very first lines is ""As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster"". At the same time, however, Martin Scorsese does not glorify violence. He does not overemphasize blood spattering or disturbing death sequences. The violence here is realistic, precisely because it's cold, cruel, and emotionless. As a result, this film is one of the more realistic, plausible, and believable crime films out there. Another thing that is better about ""Goodfellas"" is its length, 146 minutes compared to ""The Godfather""'s 175. That might not seem like much at first, but think about it. That's just short of a half-hour. ""The Godfather"", as is, could've easily been trimmed down by an hour. That can't be said about ""Goodfellas"". Things just happen in the film; it's interesting all the way, even during its more contemplative parts. Additionally, the characters of ""Goodfellas"" are really compelling, but I will avoid going in-depth here. Martin Scorsese is, as I've mentioned, at the top of his game when directing ""Goodfellas"". One particular shot near the end stands out. Scorsese makes use of the (as I like to call it) ""Vertigo effect"" (ie zooming in while tracking backwards; the characters in the foreground remain approx. the same size while there is a significant shift in the background). This shot has been overused to the point of becoming cliché, yet it works effectively here. This is just one instance of Scorsese's fantastic work on this film. He constantly keeps the audience engaged in the film and the characters. In the blink of an eye, a scene can shift from comedic to horrific. Yet such transitions never seem jarring or awkwardly paced. One more thought about the film: the upbeat soundtrack that accompanies ""Goodfellas"" is actually really well pulled off. Whenever a song plays, it fits in perfectly with the action, both in melody and lyrics. The Verdict: This is what a crime film should be all about: realistic, entertaining, gripping. ""Goodfellas"" is just about flawless. Overall Rating: 10/10",10.0,tml_pohlak_13,2009/06/30,13,8
806,The Chorus,Troubled youths find inspiration in music--familiar turf but beautifully rendered,"The Chorus (2004) How many French movies will there be that are about boyhood and innocence lost? (Including great films, like Truffaut's ""Pocket Change"" and ""400 Blows"" and Louis Malle's ""Au Revoir Les Enfants."") Out of this national necessity (and the admission of the first-time director) comes this rather nice if not quite great movie, building on the same foundations. A teacher is newly assigned to a country private school for troubled boys. He is secretly a composer, and finds a way to write choral music for the boys, who learn to sing extremely well. And so in the barest most touching way we see the vulnerability and possibility of the boys and the teacher, too. And of course the meanness of the schoolmaster. It's classic great stuff so well done you don't mind the familiar ways it works on you. Well, I have to now say that this movie is a kind of remake of a 1945 French original, ""La cage aux rossignols."" Even the title (The Cage of Nightengales) shows a poetic brilliance that is somehow just lacking here, but in the 2004 version the production values are higher, and the slightly deadpan quality of the lead (Gerard Jugnot) is compelling. Either way the story, and the simple truth of it, is worth seeing. (By the way, ""The Chorus"" is easily found streaming and on Youtube whereas the 1945 version is hard to find.) Beyond the charming idea of delinquents becoming choirboys (and one of them later a famous conductor, which you learn in the first scene), the movie has a kind of warm confirmation that people can be good, and that appreciation of love, and love itself, always abounds. The last scenes will prove this, if you give this a go. What finally holds this film down to earth is not the acting or the music or the wonderful setting in post-war provincial France. It's the story, which we've seen before, and which oddly takes no new turn at all here. It doesn't mean it's not a good story or a well made movie, not one bit. But you'll know when it starts pretty who the good guys are and the bad, and how it will more or less turn out. In that one way, the original at least is, well original.",7.0,secondtake,2015/06/18,1,1

Sorry, but if I had to choose a friend I would choose his buddy, the likable and put upon Cameron, rather than the egotistical jackass that is Ferris.

808,The Chorus,A great movie and even more so if you love choral music,"I found this a really touching movie. The beginning shows Gerard Jugnot as the new teacher who tries a new method with the difficult kids instead of the ""Action - Reaction"" motto of the board director Rachin. Not surprisingly this earns him some trust from the kids paving the way for his musical experiment. It's when the choral music starts when this movie really hit me. The music and the singing in this movie are absolutely wonderful with Jean-Baptiste Mauniers singing as a great enhancement to the already beautiful choir. I can't wait to get my hands on the soundtrack of this one. If you love choral music, especially boys choirs, this movie is an absolute ""must see""!",9.0,martdj,2005/07/14,3,2
809,Detachment,This is about Courage,"This film was beyond great. I firmly believe that not a known award is equal to the film's greatness. These characters seemed to be made by the hardest stone. So deep, emotional and strong. I could see them from my screen and right away, I was able to feel them, to hear them in real life. Their pain, misery, the feeling of lack of security, their crying, their laugh...Got into my soul. That's the main reason which the movie was made: to come into you. And it has succeeded as hell. It didn't show life at its best, neither life at its worst; only life as it is. We didn't see our characters actually heal, we didn't see them being truly happy. We saw their improvement, how the got an actual help. Eventually, that's life. To finish your time helping yourself, helping others. this is the way to true happiness. And, as the movie says, for all of this you need courage, bravery, strong attitude. Letting down is sure easily than trying hard to be better. Yes, true. But that is something that gets you into spiritual trouble. Thus, the main character was the key to give, not solutions to others problems, but to give them inspiration. There was a great accomplishment in that. Camera was awesome, as so editing. The colors were as I best like them. Music fitted nice. 10/10. Detached gave me chills.",10.0,kkokkolatos,2017/07/20,3,2

811,Spider-Man 2,With great power comes...........poetry ?,"Peter Parker is finding his life real tough, conflicted with his feelings for Mary Jane, he's also struggling at school. Add to that that his best friend is thirsting for revenge against his alter ego, and that a new breed of bad guy has been birthed, well it's a mightily challenging time. Spider-Man 2002 was a roaring success, director Sam Raimi excellently bringing the iconic web slinger to the big screen. That Spider-Man 2 met expectations is something of a stunning achievement, following on two years later from the first film, Raimi has wisely kept the same formula that made his first film so joyous. The same cast all return to cement this as a character driven franchise, so just add a new quality villain into the mix and it's all good really. Here the story is very strong, driving the picture on is Peter's struggle with his dual identity, Raimi merrily leads us along the path of his struggle whilst often hinting at what is to come, and sure enough once Doctor Octopus is born, all hell breaks loose, but because of our familiarity with all the characters, the film has gained our trust and thus the impetus hits splendidly. Raimi benefits here from having more money available and so we as the viewers get to see him weave his FX tricks, whilst great fight sequences and a more grounded bad guy both are great improvements over the first films offerings. There are also nudges aplenty to some of Raimi's other films, and fans of the Spider-Man legacy will enjoy all manner of nods in their direction. Alfred Molina is the big new addition as Dr. Otto Octavius/Doctor Octopus, he brings a sharp bit of intensity to the villain side of the persona, and although the character is never fully formed, Molina puts credible gusto into the role as we enter the final third. Fine story that is dazzlingly surrounded by quality, hell yes this is a truly great sequel. 8/10",8.0,hitchcockthelegend,2008/07/19,8,6

The movie is listed as a comedy yet I did not laugh one time. The plot was predictable. I think Hollywood needs to stop churning out cheap movies to make money on unsuspecting customers. It cost 42 mill to make & took in 46 the first month.They laugh all the way to the bank.They seriously ought to be ashamed of themselves for the poor writing & waste of good actors.Shame on the actors who let them churn out this garbage.The stars lose credibility.No wonder people are no longer so willing to go & spend $20 or more to see a movie that I would not rent from Redbox.Avoid it till its on TV for free!,,schurr64,2014/12/21,22,9
813,Intermission,demanding but rewarding offbeat comedy,"You may develop a slight case of whiplash while watching ""Intermission,"" but it will be a small enough price to pay for the pleasure of the experience. This is a fascinating film that ingeniously weaves together a myriad of overlapping stories whose common thread is life among the Irish working class. The screenplay focuses on a group of seemingly unrelated people whose lives crisscross and intersect in so well crafted a way that, as the story develops, a fully connected narrative soon emerges. Through a carefully thought-out structure and pattern, writer Mark O'Rowe and director John Crowley create order out of seeming disorder, and the overlaps never feel pre-fabricated or contrived - until the end that is, and then the contrivance is used for comic effect. The overarching theme of the piece is an examination of the subtleties and complexities that make up human interactions and human relationships. There are people here from all walks of life, yet they are basically united in their desire for love, commitment and acceptance from their fellow man. A few of them veer towards the criminal and/or violent side of life but most are just ordinary Joes (and Janes) trying to make the best of the lives they've been handed. This is one of those films in which the good people triumph over their failings, the not-so-good ones get the chance to make things right, and the irredeemable ones get their richly deserved comeuppance in the end. Colin Farrell, playing a violent, two-bit hoodlum, is the only ""name"" member of the cast, but the film boasts a whole gallery of fine actors and actresses who deliver heartfelt, winning performances. The film is filled with humor and sentiment and just enough action and violence to keep the whole thing contemporary and cutting edge (with the usual nod to ""Pulp Fiction,"" of course). The real joy of the film lies in putting yourself in the hands of the filmmakers and letting them take you wherever it is they want you to go. The trip, I promise you, will be a rewarding one. And you'll barely feel that whiplash.",8.0,Buddy-51,2005/03/13,75,59
814,The Chorus,"A man with a mission, saving the lives of children in need","Awesome!! The movie's got a great punch!! The music is spectacular! The actors did a super job, especially the kids (who actually are singing in the movie), for sure the director, who embodies like I've seen before an era of strict schooling in France,and of course the main actor, the poor supervisor who has great trouble getting himself respected by the kids(who are criminals and outcasts). The point of this movie is to show the power of music in capturing the souls and minds of children, and the miracles that can be made. Before I went to this movie, I really didn't want to see it. I was wrong. The ending is the best part; really unexpected, beautiful. it's awesome!!",10.0,brendy_5,2005/05/09,2,2
815,Hotel Transylvania,"Sandler-heavy, otherwise fine","First off, there are quite a few very good things in this movie. The wolf-man having too many kids is awesome, Callaway (Cee Lo) somehow fits perfectly as a mummy, just like Gomez in her role of the teen vampire girl. Other details, like Quasimodo as a chef, and his pet rat, are very well-worked out. Some scenes, like the rooftop sunrise scene and Dracula chasing the plane, work out perfectly. Character interaction is mostly fine, just as some of the gags and references (like Fran as Frankensteins wife). The story is highly predictable, and while the final feel-good scene is ridiculous, it is quite enjoyable overall. Overall, the movie would get a 7.5 or maybe even an 8 from me, were it not for one small detail; Adam Sandler. The guy is hilarious, but only under a very specific set of circumstances. Pull him out of his natural habitat, and he's annoying, full of stupid jokes, and way to prominent to let other actors shine. A large number of gags seem directly out of his play-book, and that's not a good thing: it contributes to the idea that he was initially cast for a smaller role, demanded a bigger one, started making changes no-one wanted, and eventually messed up the whole movie in an attempt of self- gratification and ego-massaging. So, fun movie, too bad about Sandler.",5.0,caspervanheck,2013/01/20,3,2
816,Moon,The Man in The Moon,"Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) is the man in the moon. Sam is the lone astronaut on a moonbase on the far side of the moon. He's there to mine helium that is then transported back to Earth. The mining is done remotely, huge machines roam the lunar landscape vacuuming up rocks and dust, extracting the helium. It is Sam's job to retrieve the canisters of helium and ship them off to Earth for consumption. Sam's only companion on the moonbase is Gerty (voiced by Kevin Spacey) which oversees most of the base's operations. Sam is on the last 2 weeks of his three year contract and eagerly awaits his return to see his wife and daughter. Sam is starting to feel the effects of his solitude, he's starting to hallucinate. On one of his runs to retrieve a helium canister and he starts hallucinating causing a collision with the mining machine. Sam awakes to find himself in the medical bay of the moonbase, unable to remember how he got there. He fakes a hull breach to get Gerty to let him outside the moonbase. He returns to the crash site and rescues an astronaut that looks exactly like him. Is Sam hallucinating again? Is he a clone? Is the rescued astronaut a clone? Can he even be sure of what is real? Or what is human? These are the questions Moon's director Duncan Jones presents his audience. While there are no overt references there are echoes of 2001: A Space Odyssey and maybe Alien. While Gerty isn't as malevolent as HAL in 2001 it is a distant cousin to HAL, and perhaps less duplicitous than MOTHER in Alien. Some of the sets seem a little reminiscent of 2001 maybe that's because Jones has been influenced by it. Jones has made an excellent, thought provoking alternative to the more vapid summer blockbuster movies. Go see this before Jones is swallowed up by Hollywood for Transformers 3.",10.0,jymwrite-1,2009/10/09,10,6
817,Primal Fear,Endings,"This is a very well plotted movie and fantastically acted, especially per Edward Norton's performance. I think he pulled it of so very well, and yet, at the same time I think it was an actor proof role so long as they chose a substantial actor. I think one of the most important parts of this movie to make mention of, or any movie in general, it how an effective script is such a rare gem. If you take movies like Primal Fear, Fight Club, The Usual Suspects, and Seven for example, they were all exceptionally well written scripts that all delivered the knockout punch at the ending. One should never underestimate the importance of a good twist. A great writer, director, and actor will have you leaning one way during the entire movie only to sweep you off your feet at the very last minute. It's a great talent and this movie holds true to that formula.",8.0,Babylon652,2010/05/17,2,2
818,Detachment,A must see film that deals with the very real and very hard problems we see in the education system and our lives.,"Detachment is a very real and very hard hitting film about a number of hard truths seen today in the education system, how teachers struggle to teach their kids when they do not want to learn, they don't even want to be in the building, how they are put down day in and day out for just trying to give these kids a chance at a better life, it is also about feeling very alone in this world, like you don't have a chance or that no one is really giving you one. It is a tough film to watch in some cases because it really does hit some nerves with the truths it deals with, it makes you empathise and truly feel for the characters and their inner struggle with day to day life. I feel as if every one should watch this film, not just for entertainment purposes. There is a huge reason it is my favourite film of the year, it just frames so many of the very real problems we see in, not only the education system but in our lives also. Adrian Brody, in fact everyone in this film gives a phenomenal performance and makes you truly believe they are struggling with the raw emotion they deliver. Tony Kaye has made an unsung masterpiece here I feel since I know there just isn't going to be many people who will actually sit down and watch it, to those that do, they will very likely walk away from it with a new perspective.",10.0,EnterDansMind,2012/08/25,7,5
819,Blackfish,the documentary you've heard a lot about,"t's the documentary you've heard a lot about, and if you haven't seen it, it really is an educating blast of reality. Blackfish seeks to explore the treatment of killer whales in captivity. They do this by interviewing former trainers, marine experts, and showing you actual footage of these whales in their environments. The orcas are mistreated, definitely. One sea park admitted that they kept their whales in a space that was way too small, and they all feel bad about it now. The film doesn't just go after Sea World, which is an important fact to remember. Sea World just happens to be the biggest sea park, with multiple locations. It explores problems at other parks. Blackfish does spend a great deal of time focusing specifically on Tilikum, the orca that killed its trainer, Dawn, in 2010. You will actually feel bad for Tilikum, even though he killed his trainer. The treatment that Tilikum had was unacceptable. He was bullied constantly by other whales, spent most of his time alone because of that, and clearly had exhibited behavioral issues that should have kept trainers out of Tilikum's reach. The argument is that Sea World was negligent, and knew Tilikum was a risk, and still did nothing. It's not a hard to watch documentary, like The Cove, but it is still an important one. Sea World definitely has done a lot of things wrong, and should be forced to completely reevaluate their trainer situation. The fact that they blamed Dawn for her death is deplorable. Definitely a must watch documentary.",9.0,MacTheMovieguy,2014/07/23,12,10
820,Spider-Man 2,"""I believe there's a hero in all of us.""","Being Spider-Man is wrecking poor Peter Parker's life. He's had to give up his chance at love with Mary Jane, he can't hold a job because he's always late, his grades are suffering at college, his Aunt May is struggling with the loss of beloved Uncle Ben, and his best friend Harry blames Spider-Man for the death of his father. All of this leads to Peter deciding to give up being a superhero. But a new threat rises in the form of mad physicist Otto Octavius, dubbed Dr. Octopus by the press, that may force Peter out of retirement. Sam Raimi's direction is much improved from the first film. This one he seems completely at home with the big budget blockbuster and creates many memorable scenes and images, as he often does in his lower budget work. Comic fans should appreciate the homages to the works of Lee, Ditko, and Romita, The CGI improves from the first film. There's still a little bit of the rubbery animated look of the CGI humans but not as distracting as before. The action is also more impressive. The fight scenes between Spider-Man and Dr. Octopus are well-done. The scene where Spidey saves an elevated train is arguably the movie's highlight. Danny Elfman's music is good but, as with the first film, not in the same league as his iconic Batman work. The cast knocks it out of the park. Tobey Maguire perfectly captures the essence of Peter Parker, even more so than the first movie. His inherent nerdiness, awkwardness, and struggle to do what's right even at the cost of his own happiness. Kirsten Dunst and James Franco build upon their performances from the last movie. Dunst rises above the damsel-in-distress role she's saddled with quite nicely and by the end finally feels like the iconic Mary Jane (""Go get 'em, Tiger.""). Rosemary Harris gets far more to do as Aunt May this time around and she's amazing. She steals every scene she's in. The supporting cast (J.K. Simmons and the rest) are all great. Alfred Molina brings Dr. Octopus to life and treats the character seriously, which is miles above the hammy performance given by Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin in the first film. When this came out, it was the best superhero movie since Superman '78. I walked out of the theater beaming from ear to ear and feeling like a kid again. It was one of the rare summer blockbusters I went to see more than once. It still holds up and is a high water-mark for Marvel movies, in my opinion. It's followed by a terrible third film and then a reboot series that, while good, misses a lot of what makes this film work so well. This is the definitive Spider-Man movie. Lots of humor, heart, romance, and action all told in a bright, colorful fashion. Everything a Spider-Man film should be.",9.0,utgard14,2014/05/29,18,14

822,Detachment,Detachment — Strange Simple Drama,"Detachment starts in confusion. It's difficult to get a grip on the movie's MO at first. It has a documentary feel, yet it has acting which clashes strongly in the beginning because of the over strong feelings the characters go through of which we have no clue. The poetic/philosophic vibe seems out of place, the characters too sketchy, but eventually, a symphony emerge, and tragedy ensues. It is harsh, it is realistic, it is undiplomatic, but at the same time, carries strong moral values, basic ones, not made up religious nonsense. Excellent acting, good editing, nice soundtrack, and great visual. You'll love the characters, all of them, even flawed, by the end.

Most of the last hour or so of the movie is the characters screaming at each other until Willy starts hallucinating, sending his life downhill and further out of control until he takes his car and kills himself. It was a chore to watch this movie, and it was very disappointing. The only things that lighten it up are John Malkovich's acting and the occasional funny scene.

At two and a half hours, it may well be TOO involving for most Couch Potatoes, whose attention span(s) these days tend toward the Attention Deficit Disorder variety, thanks in no small part to prolonged exposure to Commercial programs (with their non-stop, constant interruptions, which undermine the Mood the better Fright Films tend toward) and, of course, video games.

825,Crash,Poorly constructed morality tale,"The film tells several extraordinary stories happening over the scope of a few days and connects them using implausible coincidences. This makes it difficult to suspend disbelief during the entire film. All the stories share the same motif: There is good and bad in all of us, and racism has complex causes. There is little variation and little originality in the presentation of this theme. I think the makers of the film were aware of this, and tried to make the film more interesting by arranging it chronologically in such a way that the process of the different pieces of the puzzle coming together is meant to be interesting. Both the film title and the introductory dialogue allude to this, but to me it seemed like a poor excuse not to tell rich, conclusive and well-developed stories. I do appreciate movies that do not follow a simplistic good/evil pattern; I would have liked to see a more developed and refined story of Officer Ryan (Matt Dillon) and his interaction with Shaniqua and his father, for example. But there are too many plot lines to make any single one stand out, and as a consequence, the characters seem artificial rather than realistic. (As a European, I cannot judge whether the individual subcultures portrayed at all resemble reality.) The movie is not ""trash"" as some reviewers have called it, but it is forgettable and certainly not deserving of an Academy Award. As opposed to ""Brokeback Mountain"", I doubt anyone will talk much about ""Crash"" in 20 years.",6.0,xirzon,2006/03/14,44,27
826,Crash,This movie was complete junk.,"The film opens with two young black guys who are walking down the street and remarking about how America stereotypes them as criminals and how unfair it is that the world operates that way but just as you are starting to see their point of view they steal an SUV at gunpoint. So now you think the whole speech was satire and if Haggis had written it that way I might have enjoyed the movie a slight bit but instead he manages to make their feelings a constant righteous theme and they are portrayed as the victims. Matt Dillon is, of course, a racist L.A. cop who dabbles in rape- cause all cops are like that, right? And it's important for Hollywood to perpetuate this image for some reason. Dillon's character has a rookie partner who is not a racist at the start but rather an idealist who doesn't want to be a racist but finds that he cant fight his inherent white programming and, in a bigoted misunderstanding, shoots a black hitchhiker (who is actually the gun-toting carjacker- or ""victim of oppressive white America"" and the kid brother of Don Cheadles character). Fraser plays the idiotic DA whose character apparently just learned black people were on the planet and asks stupid questions to his adviser referring to them as ""those people""; Bullock is a pill-popping débutante who lords over her Mexican servants like a slave owner and plays the racist to the locksmith who can't understand her fear even though he is dressed and tattooed like a prison inmate and she just got robbed at gunpoint. Of course she still isn't meant to have any sympathy felt for her because she's apparently evil and deserved it, as the movie later reminds you when a fall down the stairs teaches her that racism is wrong. (Huh? You gotta be kidding me, people paid to see this tripe?) The only other white people in the movie are bumbling, heartless cops and a gun store owner who is (of course) a faucet of racist epitaphs. The last character of note is the gun-mad Arab store owner who is stereotypically nuts and tries to shoot the Mexican locksmith for no other reason than Haggis needed to further vilify another race du jour and with the war going on why not pick the Arabs? Now, at this point you are wondering who the hero of the movie is. It could be the black Hollywood director who gets pulled over and his wife raped by the racist LAPD or the black HMO representative who gets to enjoy her revenge on all white people by making the Dillon characters father suffer at the hands of prostate cancer- she is also made to be vindicated by the mood of the movie. I expected better by producer Don Cheadle, a representative of Hollywood I had great respect for but am not surprised by Haggis' inability to capitalize on an opportunity to succeed with a well assembled cast. That is his signature. My Final Verdict: Don't watch this movie, don't rent it, don't use it to prop your window open. Its crash all right- crash and burn.",1.0,gridwerk-1,2005/11/14,43,27

828,Spider-Man 2,Spidey Spins his Web,"Spider-Man 2 is a rare thing, a sequel that improves on the original in almost every way. Sequels tend to jump straight into the action; the characters after all, have already been developed in the original movie. Spider-Man 2 smartly eschews this rule, allowing for almost as much character development as in the first film. The result is a truly beautiful motion picture. Spider-Man 2 begins some time after the first movie. Spider-Man's real life persona, Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is a wreck. Fired from his job, falling behind in school, unable to pay his rent and out of touch with his friends Peter struggles with the duality of being Spider-Man. Meanwhile, the brilliant Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) is working feverishly to complete his latest project: a fusion reaction meant to provide a perpetual energy source. He conducts his project under the Oscorp Corporation, now led by Peter's best friend Harry Osborne (James Franco), who unbeknownst to Harry himself, is the son of deceased Spider-Man villain The Green Goblin. To complete the fusion, Octavius fits a set of artificially intelligent mechanical tentacles into his spine; these tentacles are prevented from controlling Octavius because of a tiny chip he has implanted into his neck. The fusion of course, goes awry, turning the respectable Octavius into the evil ""Doc Ock"". This sequence sets up the remainder of the movie, as Spider-Man must stop the villain from terrorizing the city, while he battles his own demons. This is where director Sam Raimi succeeds. The battles are fast-paced and shot from neat angles, with bright colours abound. An over-reliance on CGI for certain scenes can give the movie a 'cartoonish' feel, but more times than not it works well. Those scenes that further Peter's plight and his relationships with others takes up a significant amount of the movie's running time, but they never feel too long or verbose. Tobey Maguire is of course, the perfect Peter Parker. With his forlorn look and oft crackling voice, he evokes a genuine sense of pity for Peter. While I still feel that Kirsten Dunst is miscast as Mary Jane, she performs her role quite creditably. Alfred Molina is certainly quite enjoyable as the villain. Molina's Doc Ock presents a more interesting and dangerous villain than the Goblin. Making real progress since the first film is James Franco. Now freed of a peripheral role he steps nicely into the spotlight for the sequel. Further credit must be given to J.K. Simmons who plays J. Jonah Jameson. Simmons steals every scene he is in, not only because of his accurate portrayal of Jameson, but also because of his loud, unapologetic delivery of dialogue. Spider-Man 2 successfully pulls off what the Hulk tried, but was unable to do: to create a superhero film whose characters are just as exciting as the action.",8.0,ed_metal_head,2008/08/14,3,3

First of all Edgar Allen Po can learn a lesson here, never has there been something which fortifies my nihilistic views quite like the American public school system. The movie takes place in Queens/ maybe a little Brooklyn Ny. I don't mind the late night bus rides on queens blvd with underage prostitutes, cause that was the real common case pre 2000 NY. Though I believe the movie was early 1990's. Makes sense for that time. The Top tier cast playing these roles most likely as homage to their own teachers and teachers everywhere adding to their overall delivery and simply put my respect for them as actors and people. Brody is stellar playing at home on queens blvd, probably took that bus as a kid himself. James Caan offers the only much needed comedic relief, making it all the more memorable.

This is one slop of a film, and I'm disgusted to know that it has so many high reviews. It was a confusing ball of goo that amounted to nothing. I didn't care for the characters and never will. What a hopeless bunch of freaks. I don't jump on the ""freak bandwagon"" unless they're natural ones, not arrogant embodiments of deranged entertainment. The glorification of smut is worse than the smut, and that is exactly what this movie is. The sad thing is, I don't believe that some of these actors were acting at all. They were just being themselves. Travolta and Jackson in wigs??? That was scary! The only interesting thing about the movie was the sequence of events. I like the way that it started at one point and ended in the same, but dislike everything in between. The problem with this film is that it tricks the audience into giving it great reviews. It uses the ""peer pressure"" method. You know, ""this movie is for intelligent and cool people"" CRAP!! Well, I'll gladly stand among those who know that this was nothing more than a ""shock flick"". It was produced to see if the letter could be pushed a little further. Unfortunately, it drags what little respect that Hollywood has with it. I'm afraid that this is one of the major stepping stones to a pathetic industry that only produces films for vulgar lust. There's my two pennies, don't spend them all in one place!",1.0,cojosh,2006/09/09,470,193
833,Moon,Good science fiction does not grow on trees,"Good, serious science fiction is not really something we are fed up with. Looking back at the history of American sci-fi cinema we see a pretty meager landscape. Over the years there have been one or two signs of life. But no organism big enough to have a body, the genre is very much still an embryo. It's like the ape in Kubrick's 2001 threw the bone in the air, but nobody was there to pick it up. Therefore, this feature debut from British writer-director Duncan Jones is a movie pretty alone in it's kind, which would seem fitting given it's plot involving one man alone on the moon. Sure, we can find some hints and homages here and there. Suffice to say, if you were at all fascinated by Solaris, Alien, 2001 or Blade Runner, you will enjoy this movie. But that's also as far as it goes. One could say, if you enjoyed those movies then hurry up to catch this one because they don't come along very often. As far as movies go, quantum wise, it's lonely in space. Any admirer of this genre will approve the setup of the movie. In some close or parallel, would-be future, we energize the planet with solar energy, taken and generated from the sun to Earth, from generators located on the moon. There is one job vacancy for an administrator up there. Thus, within the large facilities we meet Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) who has been up there for three years and now has but two weeks left of his contract. He is beyond homesick, talking to himself and several plants and gazing at loved ones through video messages through cold machines. His loneliness has even driven his health to a shaky state. What was that? Am I alone in here? Probably just imagining things. Right, exactly. His only company is that of Gerty, a friendly computer moving by the ceiling, expressing his mood in smileys and carries the voice of Kevin Spacey. Gerty seems to be a very sweet and innocent baby brother of HAL 9000s but geez, everybody knows you can't trust any kind of artificial intelligence in space. The movie, exceptionally well paced from start to finish, gives you the morning (and evening) routines of Sam's and then we start the plot mechanisms when Sam has a little accident, is knocked unconscious and wakes up at the medical ward. ""How long have I been gone?"" he asks Gerty's happy smiley. ""Oh, not very long"" is the reply. But it looks like Sam has got some initial problems moving his legs and if you've seen Kill Bill you know enough to get suspicious. The story that follows is pretty much impossible not to follow with interest and excitement. This is a movie you can't really make much of a review of, since so much of what happens in it is for the viewer alone to find out about. But there are certain things worth mentioning. Much of the content in Moon are things that have been the subject of many science fiction movies, even campier ones, and I guess if anything holds it away from being truly great and ""merely"" enjoyable it's that it moves within it's own comfort zone, not breaking any significant new grounds, specially in contrast to the perplexing heights at which real sci-fi masterpieces have gone. Perhaps this is a beginner's trade. In any case, it's a highly notable first feature. What probably struck me as the very most impressing thing in the movie though, was Sam Rockwell's one man show (or, ""one"" man show if you will... or maybe one ""man"" show.. nevermind, you'll get it later). It's been clear to me since a while back that he is a quality actor - variating his roles to that of alcoholic looser/hair-trigger in Snow Angels to Zaphod Beeblebrox in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy - but this time he really holds up much of the entire movie on his shoulders. Without spoiling anything, I can say he gets to use body language, psychological presence and provide action from his character facing intense and unimaginable emotional situations. I hope he feels proud of his work in it, because it certainly comes off as hard work. It's difficult not to recommend a movie like Moon. It is rare we see movies of it's kind, and for any fan of the genre it's definitely worthwhile. It's a well made, adequately thought provoking, proper science-fiction movie, it's only actual flaw being that it's not better than Solaris.",7.0,revival05,2009/09/20,16,8
834,Ferris Bueller's Day Off,The craftiest skip day ever!,"What can I say about high school? The separation between diligent students and lazy students couldn't be more obvious. It's also funny how breaking all the rules is a desperate longing for rebellion and following all the rules is a desperate longing for acceptance. Highschool was surely a funny time. Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick) was an interesting young chap who wanted to enjoy his life as a youth whilst living in a suburban Illinois neighbourhood. I must say, it is typical behaviour in places where there is no action. Suburbia is a 'manufactured' lifestyle where there is no activity of any sort. Children often feel bored and as a result, they misbehave more often. Ferris is in his senior year and he longs to have fun before he graduates. It may not seem so, but he means well when he drags his scrupulously-natured best friend, Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck) and his sweetly-natured girlfriend, Sloan Peterson (Mia Sara) to 'dance' the day away (so to say). They play along with it and as a result, they unexpectedly had an unforgettable day and a thrill of a lifetime (the ball game, fancy lunch prank, cruising downtown Chicago in a red Ferrari). He cunningly fakes sick in the most technological of ways (even with our advanced 21st century technology, I must say this is more advanced than I could have ever imagined; he must have really planned this). Life is short. We should live every second as if it were our last. Mr Rooney was a successful, suburban secondary school principal who obviously has nothing better to do than to 'catch' Ferris in the act. He was so determined to do so that he went well out of his way to the point where he was only fooling himself. To reinforce authority is one thing, but to 'chase' someone is another. This movie really gets one thinking about how things could have been if he or she followed or broke the rules. Out of all the skip days I have seen, I must say that this is one that could never be easily executed (for those of whom I knew thought they were 'bad' by skipping school by writing false parental notes; that is rather asinine). I rate this film 5* for its originality and creativity.",10.0,Ninsen,2006/05/19,7,4
835,Pulp Fiction,the most over valued film of the '90s,"Pulp Fiction is one of those movies you feel uncomfortable to talk about in negative terms since mainstream loves it. The real killer of this movie are the dialogs supposedly so cool but instead being silly and irritating, from the very first scene when endless minutes are waisted talking about a frivolous argument. The violence in this film, rather strong, is very often disturbing but never fun or entertaining. Tarantino takes himself a little too seriously making the movie lose most of its ironical aspect. Unless you are a fan that goes wild for the overweight Travolta, you will find his so-called cult scenes dull and of no interest. All the characters in this movie are exaggerated, and that wouldn't be a bad thing, but they also are not fun. There are some good action scenes, very few, which anyhow will not save from failure a movie that lasts 2hrs 40min!",2.0,cfcpg,2005/11/18,161,71
836,Taxi Driver,A classic example of great acting without necessarily focused story.,"The movie goes on quite unclear about the main conflict that the main character has to settle. It seems like there is nothing that he is fighting for. This thing went on for almost the entire movie. The finale's result thus comes as a surprise. This lack of clarity and confusion also reflects in the scoring, changing back and forth between being romantic and being mysterious. I see the inspiration of some later works in this movie, which may include Al Pacino's Insomnia, The acting side, on the other hand, is very nice. We get to see Robert DeNiro's totality in plating his character here. Jodie Foster, despite her rather short duration time, manages to give her role a significant meaning. Albert Brooks and Harvey Keitel's presence bring more color to this movie.",6.0,Seraphion,2014/10/03,8,5
837,The Fault in Our Stars,"Some good acting, insincere, infantile script.","I've created an account for the sole cause of writing a review for this film, as I'm stunned by the fact that very few people seem to notice the flimsiness of the script. Although this is obviously a teen movie, it starts OK with a good level of irony to balance out the profound underlying subject, not to make it too sentimental. This balance is totally lost after about 45 minutes. Anne Frank comes in out of nowhere, just to stir up the emotions a little more. This (along with some other plot twists) came across so insincere, that I decided to leave the theater half an hour before the film ended. The fact that tear jerking seems to be a higher priority than offering solace and a good movie leaves a bad taste in my mouth.",3.0,eldituk,2014/07/03,29,13

What could have become a cliché of a film: boys (including the outcast 'geek') make good and are eventually acknowledged against all odds, becomes a fine study in human and social relationships. In particular, the actors playing the family of (Jake Gyellenhaal) are very good indeed, Chris Cooper (as the father)reflecting in particular the dynamics of a father-son relationship so typical of the '50's and '6o's. Laura Dern, as Miss Reilly, the teacher who believes in, inspires and stands up for the boys, is excellent. The music is good, conveying the period well.

840,The Chorus,A Wonderful Warm Life Affirming Film That Only The French Can Make,"England used to make good films, still copied today but not as well (THE LADYKILLERS), but now all it makes is two types of shows: those with shotguns, seedy tattoo parlours, graffiti inner city streets, junkies and fighting and the second about toffs in period costume. Alas there is nothing in between. Only 25 miles away, is England's neighbour, France, which makes regular masterpieces, of which this is a prime example. It is set in the recent past, the late 40's, and concerns the redemption of a failed musician posted to a rural boy's school for rough kids and orphans. Gradually, and you know he will, he forms a choir from these no-hopers, transforming their lives and his own. It is full of charm, warmth, in the best classical way of film-making. A splendid effort, and rightly belongs in your DVD library. Excellent acting,art direction, confident and intelligent direction (surely big projects will now come his way). The music CD is on the best seller charts throughout Europe and understandably so. The music is different by juxtaposition: you see these poorly dressed scruffy boys, living under a repressive regime, yet singing ditties by Rameau like angels about dreams, oceans, and zephyrs. A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT, released at the same time, is a big slick version of quirky Gallic charm, and also excellent, full of crane moves, great cameraman's set ups, and a big-scale version of personal versus macro scale ( a fiancée searching for her missing soldier who did not return from the WW1 trenches ) yet between the two, THE CHORUS lingers in the mind with a fondness and a smile.",9.0,nicniewart,2005/07/25,3,2
841,The Wailing,The Death Stranding of Korean horror,"I don't understand the remarkable amount of praise being heaped on this movie. One of the problems that I have found with Korean movies in general, and specifically Korean horror over the last decade or so, is the prevalence of slapsticky characters. I'm not even sure if this is deliberate on the part of the filmmakers, or if it is just part of how the general Korean acting style has evolved over decades. The protagonist is this chubby cop who is constantly falling down and shooting goofy looks directly at the camera. He also cries in every other scene, and by the end of the movie, I was thoroughly annoyed and couldn't care less about what he was going through. And he goes through some REALLY bad s-t at the end. This is subjective though, as some people won't have a problem with this. Some people won't care about crying and falling over. But I think MOST people WILL care about the fact that this movie is almost 2 1/2 hours, and almost 90 minutes of this runtime is a red herring. Without spoiling anything, there is also a very familiar horror trope that pops up in the second half of the movie; one that I'm pretty sure no one is impressed by, much less scared by. The movie does look really nice, the cinematography and scenery are beautiful, and it has generally good performances, the one caveat being the lead actor.",5.0,Magnotta43,2019/12/28,12,6
842,Blackfish,Truth(spoilers),"While for the public its easy to pick a side, free the animals or keep them captive to show us what they are what they do and so on... As a person who loves animals and has a knowledge base of behavior captivity as well as a dip and degree in Animal care and management I can honestly say its hard claiming whats right or wrong for many of our animals however marine animals should not be captive. I agree to some extent about zoo breeding to make sure genes are crossed and animals kept from going extinct. Orca's however are doing well in the wild, the only thing killing them is our stupidity. The only thing taking them from their homes is out need for entertainment. They are a highly intelligent mammal like dolphins and need to be left alone. It's easy for people to claim they don't see anything wrong but if you have watched this you know whats wrong. These giants live for 100years in the wild or max 30 in captivity.... how can anyone state they are in better care in captivity! 1percent of wild have collapsed dorsal fins while 100% of captive males have it? this is our fault, worse off we continue to breed from animals who have been used and abused and tormented! They even start to fight and kill each other which is sad as they create family pods in the wild but in captivity they are forced into groupings. This film is amazing, it shows how little knowledge the trainers have how they did in fact love the animals and once they understood they where not helping but hindering the animals they do love so much they stepped back. A must see by anyone thinking of ever going to a show that contains an orca (in fact a must see for anyone who think animals are our entertainment).",10.0,KoalaDays,2013/09/10,17,14
843,October Sky,The first great film of 1999. *** out of ****.,"There is an old saying that relates to the rousing new film by Joe Johnston that goes something like this: ""The man who thinks he can and the man who thinks he can't are both right."" That is a highly presumptuous statement referring to self motivating and belief in an individual, which, in this movie, stand true even after road blocks and family trouble stand in the way. ""October Sky"" is about a young man who believes in himself named Homer Hickam, growing up in a strict, traditional family in the 1950's. Homer loves in a small coal mining town where nearly every man grows up to be a miner. All of his friends, Quentin, Roy, and O'Dell all think that their life after high school will be like everyone else's. Homer is not exited about that future. One night, while everyone stares at the sky, a Russian space craft called Sputnik passes overhead. This is something new for Homer, and he finds it spectacular and overwhelming. From this point on, his look at life will never be the same. First, he tells everyone that he wants to work in the rocket scientist area for an occupation. Flabbergasted at what he says, his family passes that idea over their heads and continues with life as usual His friends, however, think that this idea may have some potential. After all, Quentin is a very smart individual when it comes to this kind of thing. When the four friends start to test model rockets, and blow a white picket fence to smithereens, then what seems to be a forest fire is scared by them, they're forced to end their progresses. The performances in this movie are absolutely riveting from start to finish. All of the actors give performances as if this is the real mumbo jumbo here. Standing out in all of the glory: Laura Dern as Miss Riley. This very well may be Academy award material if the judges can remember back to the beginning of the year when this film is released. The characters are also extremely well developed. Not only to the filmmakers give clear, apparent reason why Homer is interested in the subject, but they also explain to the audience how they are succeeding in their studding of rocketry. We clearly understand all of the characters' motives and beliefs, especially the father, who is bent over on everlasting tradition. The film, unfortunately, loses some of its momentum at mid-point because of a silly, recycled romantic sub-plot involving Homer's love interest and how his brother stole her from him. This type of this is becoming so awfully common in high-school movies, not that this film is aimed at high-schoolers. The actors stare at each other mindlessly, like the are in a trance. I put up with it without complaining in 1997's ""Inventing the Abbots,"" but I have had just about enough this. But that is just a minor complaint. With an authentic looking time period, cinematography worth an Oscar and clips of the real life Homer and friends at the end, whom all hit it big with their dreams, especially Homer, this is the first great film of 1999.",8.0,Movie-12,1999/02/24,56,44

Putting aside the fact that I heard and read about the big sacrifices that Norton did for the filming of ""Fight Club"" (losing 20 kilos and gaining the fit and full of muscles body in just 40 days) I wouldn't bee so amazed of the Aaron/Roy performance in ""Primal Fear"".

850,Blackfish,Incisor,"""Humans have a penchant for pretending that animals do not feel pain. Spurious beliefs like these are essential if we are to bend them to our will, make them work for us, wear them, eat them, without any disquieting tinges of guilt or regret."" - Carl Sagan Fascinating, and a little bit sad, ""Blackfish"" is a documentary by Gabriela Cowperthwaite. It focuses on captive killer whales - also known as 'orcas' - and the deaths and injuries incurred by their trainers at various marine parks around the world. On its most conventional level, ""Blackfish"" dazzles us with the majesty, intelligence and peculiarities of wild orcas. The film then becomes a sermon about the cruelty of keeping whales captive for entertainment purposes. Along these lines, Cowperthwaite accuses marine parks (most notably SeaWorld) of abusing whales, misleading the public and manipulating their own trainers. The film then becomes a more specific anti-corporate screed, portraying marine parks as ideological bodies which essentially brainwash audiences, trainers, customers and engage in various forms of propaganda and deception. More sinisterly, Cowperthwaite accuses marine parks of covering up the dangers of killer whales, so as to win court cases, avoid settlements and help push down wages. ""Blackfish"" then dips into philosophy. Here we watch as trainers anthropomorphise orcas, imbuing the bulky creatures with human qualities, emotions and behavioural traits. For their trainers, orcas are essentially ""human"", with identifiable qualities, emotions and emotional attachments. These naive projections are overturned when the orcas begin maiming and devouring trainers. From this point onwards, the whales are deemed ""alien"", ""unknowable"", such that their trainers are forced to reconsider their previous assumptions. Do whales really ""love"" their trainers? Are whales obedient simply because they are subjected to games of reward and torture? Is orca ""affection"" based on a human misreading of signals? Are these orcas really happy? As Cowperthwaite begins critiquing these anthropomorphic views, she also does the opposite. By its second half, ""Blackfish"" might as well be a treatise on crime, terrorism and spree-killing. Here Cowperthwaite clashes various world-views. On one hand, the whales are subjected to old fashioned ""essentialism"" - the notion that their behavioural traits are fixed and that they have a ""natural"" set of dangerous, murderous attributes. On the other hand, the behaviour of the whales are seen to be a product of external or social forces – the notion that they kill because of abuse, neglect, the destruction of their families, captivity, violence etc. Cowperthwaite uses both world-views to push the same agenda: get orcas out of marine parks. ""Blackfish"" is alleged to have led to a severe dip in ""SeaWorld"" attendance. It has also led to the company implementing several reforms, though the company's policies still irk animal rights activists. In the future, when we're all synthetic food-paste eating vegetarians who visit virtual marine parks via the neural implants in our brains, the politics of ""Blackfish"" might look quaint. 8.9/10 - Worth one viewing.",,tieman64,2015/02/26,3,3
851,October Sky,Satisfying upbeat drama of dreams fulfilled,"Joe Johnston's fine drama tells the story of 4 young high school students who get caught up in the days after Sputnik's launch. Their dream is to win the state science fair with a rocket of their own. The film has a remarkable sense of time and place using music of the period and the superb production design of Barry Robinson. It's hard to believe that the film was filmed entirely on sets. The mining town is grittily realistic. Jake Gyllehaal gives a fine performance as the leader of the quartet of youthful scientists. Chris Cooper portrays his father, foreman of the coal mine. Their scenes together are moving and emotionally satisfying. Although the outcome is predictable, the finale has that lump-in-the-throat upbeat climax. This is a fine film for teenagers and young people. It's a shame they would probably rather see something like ""The Waterboy"". It shows a lovely film can be made for only 23 million dollars.",8.0,cinemel,1999/02/09,1,1
852,Detachment,'Some people expend tremendous energy merely to be normal',"Tony Kaye, the elusive director of the hard-hitting 'American History X', directs a glittering all-star cast in this existential tour de force. 'Detachment' may have been released a few months short of Oscar season, and given a limited run, but nominations for best director, best lead actor (Adrien Brody) and best original screenplay (first-timer Carl Lund) are the very least this five-star film deserves. Adrien Brody, a great actor despite many dubious roles, delivers his finest performance since 2002's 'The Pianist'. Here he plays Henry Barthes, a substitute teacher whose back-story is more tumultuous than those of the inner-city kids he teaches. Their problems are self-evident. They come from broken homes, are largely ethnic, indigent and have few opportunities to escape their genetic misfortune. Henry's neglect began as young boy when his father left home, causing his mother to fatally overdose, leaving him to care for his Alzheimer's-stricken grandfather. Kaye brilliantly manages to develop a long list of peripheral characters whilst never removing the focus from Henry. Marcia Gay Harden's principal knows she heads a failed school, but forlornly clings on despite her impending extinction. Lucy Liu, the school shrink, reveals in a violent outburst that she is more vulnerable than the kids. James Caan (outstanding in his supporting role) consoles her, as he plays the only teacher who seems to be able to cope, though only with the aid of happy pills. He relates to the students by coming down to their level, which is a very low level indeed. Christina Hendricks, Tim Blake Nelson and William Peterson fill in as other teachers; the sort who would have said they came into this hellhole to 'make a difference'. The story pays homage to 'Taxi Driver' when Henry befriends underage prostitute, Erica (Sami Gayle in her film debut). At first he has no intention of sheltering her, and is content to allow her to continue prostituting herself. But just as Iris was De Niro's saviour in the other film, Erica unwittingly becomes Henry's saviour. Drawing inspiration from existentialist novelist Albert Camus, the other key character in this story is Meredith (Tony Kaye's daughter, Betty). She plays Henry's only capable student, but has serious self-confidence issues because she is overweight and – the film's recurring theme – has wretched parents. Henry reassures her with his philosophical insights, but her confidence is crushed when he refuses to embrace her, causing a tragic and irreversible conclusion. I appreciate this film because it courageously illuminates a dark side of life. It drew me in and blew me away. It has so much heart and emotional integrity that I sat in the back row, quietly sobbing my eyes out as I remembered related events in my own life. [URL]",9.0,dharmendrasingh,2012/08/26,6,4
853,Pulp Fiction,Like a nightmare that never ends.,"Well, I finally saw 'Pulp Fiction'. Hadn't after all this time, but I've heard *so* much ta-doo over it, so I rented it. UGH. I guess I must not be film critic material, because I didn't appreciate the 'art' of this film, or its 'brilliance', or any 'statement' it might have made. It was unpleasant, filled with scumbag people I cared nothing about, doing godawful things to each other with horrendously graphic visuals and appalling dialogue. It jumped around in time, circling back to where it opened, but from another viewpoint, and while that may be some sort of artsy crafting in editing or storytelling, it doesn't save it from the fact that it was just plain revolting. When the characters could get away for a second from m-f-ing all over the place, there *was* some interesting verbal exchange... bright and witty and even vaguely profound, but Kafka it ain't. I have to say, I thought all the performances were incredible, esp Samuel Jackson, but can't Quentin Tarantino stay OUT of any of his own films?! Even playing a 'nicer' guy, he comes off as a borderline psycho. I thought it was *very* interesting, tho, to see Chicago Hope's Eric Stoltz in there as a drug dealer. I worry about people's minds, if this is what they think of as a great movie. EEK! A movie about redemption? Gee... I didn't see any of that. If perhaps a character got out of the violent melee alive, I'd hardly call that 'redemption', if they are hardly anyone worth caring about being redeemed in the first place. An earthquake fault could have opened up and swallowed the lot of 'em, and I would have applauded. People think it's really cool or trendy to give accolades to trash nowadays.

855,Detachment,One of the best films I've seen in while,"Although the story is rather ""dark"", that does not merit a low score for this beautiful film, if the tone wasn't so somber it would ruin the intent of the production. Adrien Brody's performance was absolutely stellar, his characterization was phenomenal, and produced such demanding emotions effortlessly on camera. This isn't all that surprising looking back on his performance in The Pianist. Tony Kaye's directing style was refreshingly unique and subtle, which we don't see in many films in this day, and in my opinion makes this film ever more so impacting.",10.0,farzansewani23,2012/04/07,14,10
856,Spider-Man 2,Bravo Sam Raimi & Sony,"This by far one of Sony's best work om the character of Spider-Man alongside Spider-Verse. A great interpretation of Spider-Man. It is a film that focuses on what matters. The character. Sam Raimi took everything that worked about the first Spider-Man movie and made it so much better. We see a Peter Parker with relatable problems. We see a man that never loses his will and never gives up ACTUALLY give up. He literally can't catch a break. And when he does catch a break and has his confidence boosted it feels so satisfying. This Peter Parker is probably one of the best if not the best character in the whole CB Genre. Doctor Octavius is man which Peter idolizes not only on his work in making the world a better place but also in his love life. Think about it Otto and his wife are a shadow reflection of what Peter wants. When Otto's wife dies and Otto goes insane all he wants is to rebuild the machine that made him proud, that made his wife proud. Harry's development in this movie is completely amazing he goes from being a best friend to absolutely hating Peter and being completely broken from the loss of his father who he so much wanted to impress. Bravo Sony. Bravo Sam. Thank you for giving us this masterpiece. Thank you for giving your soul into making this movie amazing. Thank you for making our childhood and adulthood amazing with this classic.",10.0,amazingkick,2019/07/15,50,47
857,October Sky,We can also be the next Homer Hickam.,"** This is my homework** October Sky, a film woven by the odds between father and son, and the dream of living oneself's life. Homer Hickam, the protagonist of the film, had an 'impossible' dream since he witnessed the launch of the first man-made satellite. Because of this dream, he befriended with the weird yet smart geek Quentin, and started the journey of rocket making with Quentin, Roy Lee and O'Dell. In Coalwood, high school graduates usually could not further their study in college, the only opportunity going to college is getting the football scholarship. But Homer did not surrender to his fate of being a coal miner. Of course,Homer's father, who was the leader of the coal miner and expected his son will be a coal miner, did not support him making rockets. There were many obstacles on the road of Homer's goal, he and his friends was accused as arsonists as they could not find all their rockets back, therefore, he was suspended. During that period, his father was injured as he tried to save the miners in an accident. The family could not afford the charge of surgery, so that Homer decided to work as a coal miner to provide for his family instead of his brother, who got the football scholarship, and would not be able to go to college if he dropped out at that moment. I think it is very responsible of Homer to prioritize his family , yet, it is upset to see him giving up his dream. There is a scene where they ignited the gasoline bomb and hurled it into the hut on there experiment site, it symbolizes the end of their dream. 'Sometimes you really can't listen to what anybody else says, you just gotta listen inside.' The words of Miss Riley evoked Home's enthusiasm of rocketry and the passion buried deep inside the heart of the audience as well. I as an audience member, instantly asked my self, ' what's my inside voice's telling me? What do I want to achieve?' Similar to Homer, my school does not produce many graduates who can go to university, but I will not be tied and I know I will and have to outshine others so that I will have the chance to further my study in University and that I can fight against the fate I should supposedly live. Homer was determined to devote in rocketry after being inspired by Miss Riley. He studied very advance Mathematics twenty-four-seven, at lunch time in coal mine, at night on bed. He eventually figured out that the fire was not started by their rockets, they were not related to the arson! This is the twist I love most, as when I was watching the movie, I felt like I was walking in Homer's shoes. It gives me strength to move on. Finally, the Rocket Boys got the champion of the county science fair, both four of them got the scholarships to go to college. Still, they are proving nothing to others, they are just being themselves, whom they knew do not belong here or work in coal mines. Along the plot of Homer chasing his dream, there is another line of plot of the father-and-son odds. 'Father love the mines more than Jim, even more than you!' Homer groaned to his mother. Because of the pride of his father, he did not want his son to see coal miner as a not so classy job and expected his second son to be like him, a coal miner. 'Coal mine is your life, it's not mine. I'm never going down there again.' Homer confronted his dad, I believe his dad must be broken hearted at that time. It was harsh for Homer to say things like that, but I figure telling the true feeling would be better. After Homer came back from the science fair, there is a scene where Homer showing his medal while his father going down the mine elevator, we can see the eyes of Homer's father, the way he looked at his son, he was proud of his son. Homer was also jealous of his brother, as his dad never missed a game of his brother, but he had never come to watch him launching the rockets. In the very end, Homer's father was there to launch the rockets, the smile on Homer was sweeter than you have ever seen. This also credits to the actors, they did an incredible job on playing the roles. I have already expressed my appreciation to this superb film, another fact that impressed me most is that this film is base on a true story. I do not see why you and I cannot be the next Homer Hickam! What's your inside voice telling you?",10.0,chanpolam,2011/08/16,1,1
858,Ferris Bueller's Day Off,The Best (Early) Beatles Movie,"Spoilers herein. John Hughes had made a few `straight' teen movies before this: that's where the world of the movie -- though abstract -- is to be taken at face value. The actors actually try to play their characters, in fact Hughes generally tries to find actors that already are those characters. But he tried something else with Molly Ringwald starting with `Breakfast Club' where he cast her `against type.' Much of that film depended on a notion of acting to be someone else. Here he takes the next step, this time with Broderick. And this time, he gets a seasoned, self-aware actor. This time, the story is not about teen angst associated with self-identity, but about the joy of the con. The pleasures of being someone else (which is all most kids have anyway). Broderick's stage experience before this was all in roles where he winked at the audience: `See what I do.' A couple years later, Bruce Willis would reintroduce this style of acting to the big picture, but here we have it early. The tip-off is those moments when Ferris -- or is it Broderick? -- looks straight at you and tells you about the role he is playing: Broderick playing a role of a kid who is playing a role. We have the `Mr Peterson' bit; the `sausage king' bit; the performance in the parade; the fake-in-the-bed bit (shades of `Home Alone'), the sick six year old bit; and finally the actor telling us to just go home. Its all acting about acting: a teen's life is all about adopting a persona. Today, this seems normal, but in its time, it was pretty revolutionary film for a mainstream product. Its the reason this is remembered so fondly, because for many youngsters -- those who never learn to read intelligently -- it was the first encounter with reflexive art. (The previous generation got their's from the Beatles and Dylan.) I'm not sure what teen film predecessors there could be, but this may be where the whole explosion of non-ironic irony in teen films comes from. That redhead Stephanie Blake character is important. Look for her. Ted's Evaluation: 3 of 4 -- Worth watching.",,tedg,2002/12/07,19,11
859,Blackfish,"Breathtaking, emotional documentary you can't stop watching!","Distressed 911 calls saying that a whale has eaten one of the trainers while we see underwater footage of Orcas and trainers opens up for this documentary made by Gabriela Cowperthwaite. These are the calls from the day when Dawn Brancheau was killed in February 24, 2010 in SeaWorld of Florida. How could this happen? What went wrong? What is to blame? The structure of the film is superb, beginning with the recent attack in SeaWorld and then going back 4 decades to see where it all began from the capture of the whales, following how they were treated, investigating attacks from the past, eventually leading to an understanding why this could happen. It is explained to the viewer that Orcas in captivity suffer from psychological and emotional stress. The people in the film contradicting this mean that Orcas have a better life and live longer in captivity, because they get access to medical care and always have food and shelter available. This is obviously false. It is the same old arguments used by people in favor of animal captivity. Apparently killer whales in the wild have double the life span. It is also explained by an expert that after scanning their brains, it shows that Orcas have parts of the brain that humans do not. And especially when it comes to emotions, the Orca's brain seem to be more advanced. The best part of this documentary is how emotionally gripping it is, presented in interviews with former trainers, Orca researchers, killer whale hunters among others and with footage of the Orcas. Scary scenes where trainers are being attacked and emotional ones showing heartbreak both from the whales in form of cries when they are separated from their families and from people that have lost family members in the attacks. This film really moves you. Other than being well-produced and containing animations presented beautifully it is also an important eye-opener to the fact that it might not be OK, morally to keep smart animals (or any beings) in captivity. Both times I was watching this film my eyes were fixed on the screen. This documentary is golden!",9.0,AlexanderHiden,2015/12/23,3,3

861,Blackfish,A Heartfelt Documentary That Leaves an Indelible Mark on Your Psyche,"Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK) Rating: 5/5 stars Anybody who loves animals, or even cares for them moderately, or even those who just have a shred of humanity in them, simply have to watch the documentary film - ""Blackfish"" - that released a few months ago. You'll be disgusted at the heinous acts perpetrated on the innocent, sentient, and supremely intelligent whales by the most ruthless creature to ever walk this planet - ""Man""! It's an emotional, sad journey, which is sure to make a morally conscious person question the sanctity of the human race, and perhaps be appalled at the absolute apathy and callousness with which so many humans lead their lives. One last thing, whatever you do, if you ever visit America, or plan to settle there, or are currently residing in the country; please never buy a ticket to that despicable cesspool masquerading as an aquatic themed marine-entertainment park - ""Sea World"".",10.0,DareDevilKid,2013/11/10,11,9
862,Blackfish,A powerful and heartbreaking documentary!,"Blackfish is a very effective and heartbreaking documentary from Gabriela Cowperthwaite that portrays the psychological effects captivity has on the killer whale, a creature known for it's exceptional intelligence and a surprisingly wide array of emotions. While a predator, the killer whale also has never been known to harm a human being in the wild yet, Blackfish reveals that the effects of their treatment in captivity may have changed that as a number of injuries and deaths have been attributed to these normally majestic and human friendly animals. The documentary uses the story of Tilikum, a SeaWorld resident and one of the largest killer whales in captivity who has been involved in not one but, three deaths including two trainers and one individual who chose to sneak into the park at night and was found dead draped over the animals back the following morning. While SeaWorld has attributed these deaths to trainer error or in the case of the park intruder, accidental drowning, the condition of the bodies revealed by autopsies indicate otherwise. We are painted a picture that depicts an organization that keeps these large animals in small dark tanks for hours, takes babies away from their mothers at only a few months old and puts the very family oriented animals in with unfamiliar members of it's species resulting in bullying and aggressive behavior. We get interviews with former trainers who describe the sad and sometimes cruel way these majestic beasts are treated and how SeaWorld likes to paint a far different, almost fairy tale like picture of the animals' life there. The footage we see and the trainer testimony is organized in a very effective profile of an intelligent animal that is normally gentle and friendly towards humans whose life in captivity frustrates and twists them till they become violent and aggressive to not only each other but, towards their keepers as well. And to be honest it is not only heartbreaking but, aggravating to watch. Not only for the whales treatment but, at the audacity of SeaWorld to blame the injuries and tragic deaths on the trainers themselves and not the emotional scarring of the animals they work with. The recent death of trainer Dawn Brancheau is especially focused on here and you watched with clenched fists as this woman who obviously loved her job and the animals she worked with was brutally killed by an emotional outburst by Tilikum only to have SeaWorld blame her death solely on her. If this documentary sounds bias, to a degree it has a point to make and in it's defense SeaWorld was offered a chance to appear on camera and tell their side and refused, only now issuing a statement refuting the film now that it has been shown and gotten attention. So, while the film does give a very negative view of theme parks like this and it's effects on the animals that are captive there, it wasn't like the theme parks weren't given an opportunity to have their say. And by letting Cowperthwaite paint her emotional and heartbreaking story with actual footage and testimony unchallenged, we get a powerful and moving indictment of a business that seems to turn a blind eye to it's treatment of animal and trainer alike and the sometimes fatal repercussions it has, as long as those turnstiles keep turning and the money keeps rolling in. A very effective documentary and more of an emotional impact then most films you're likely to see.",8.0,jaguiar313,2013/11/13,8,7
863,Spider-Man 2,A powerful and memorable sequel,"I have never been much of a Spiderman fan, as a matter of fact I am not really a comic book fan overall. However I enjoyed Raimi's first Spiderman film very much and was more than happy to check out the second instalment when it was first released in cinema. My hopes before entering the cinema were not too high to be honest, I expected it to be one of those sequels which were simply out just to make money. However by the time I was leaving the cinema my thoughts were completely different to my expectations. Everything about this film in my personal opinion is an improvement from the first. The acting is a lot better and you can tell that the actors really do understand and care for the characters that they are playing. Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst have some outstanding chemistry in this film and of course not to forget the fantastic performance from Alfred Morlina who plays the menacing Dr Otto Octavius. Also the action in this film is a large improvement along with the special effects, each action sequence is directed well and is executed in a fast and exciting pace, making the film a real roller-coaster ride. Finally one thing that made this film so memorable for me is how much deeper and personal it is compared to the first film. As the original shows Peter Parker becoming Spiderman, this instalment shows the problems that Peter faces actually being Spiderman and what he must sacrifice. I do not usually like to compare sequels to original films as in my opinion every film whether it is sequel or remake should be given a chance on its own. However Spiderman 2 is one of those sequels which shines well above the first instalment and in my opinion has so far been the best in the series. 8 out of 10",10.0,film_lover2008,2008/04/03,8,6
864,Crash,"Worst movie of the year. Please, do not waste your time.","Crash is supposed to be a film about racism in Los Angeles. But in fact, it's just a bunch of coincidences between several characters that connect each other during one day in one of the biggest cities of the world. Who the hell is going to believe that? There are unrealistic situations, one after the other. On the other hand, this film pretends to show racism between Asians, Iranians, Latinos, Blacks, and Whites. But the big error relies on a pre-establish racism coming from the writer. Mainly because the White characters in this movie are usually portrait as people with a better social-economical status than the rest of the other races. Iranians are poor, just like the Asians. And Latinos, as always, are portrait as Housekeepers, police officers, or with a very low profile job like a locksmith. Jesus!!! Don't you guys think it's about time to change these stereotypes? Same with blacks, portrait as gang members, with the exception of a Black TV Director, who was the only fresh character for me. This movie sucks so hard, that makes me so disappointed about the kind of cinema coming out from Hollywood these days. Always with stereotype characters. No realism whatsoever. Nothing to identify with. It's simply a big waste because this could have been a great opportunity to show Latinos, Koreans, Iranians, and blacks, from a different perspective.",1.0,rh2positivo,2005/07/16,75,44

The cast is brilliant and all played their roles incredibly well. I personally thought Joe Pesci was the star of the show, he was just crazy and funny as well, a really likable character. Lorraine Bracco was also deserving of a mention. The action is extremely good and the set looks fantastic. Martin Scorsese really has done a brilliant job with this film. The soundtrack was also great and went perfectly with the film. I also liked how some characters narrated parts of the film, this really helped in parts.

This is one of the most infuriating movies i've ever watched in my life. i don't know why everyone loves it, and i was in high school when i first saw this, so i was at the perfect age. and i STILL hated this movie. Besides not liking Matthew Brod (except in lion king) the main thing that frustrated me in this movie is that ferris decides that he deserves to have a day off. This confused me because he'd already had 8 days off and he couldn't have another one off. Now correct me if i'm wrong, but doesn't that mean he's already done this EIGHT times? so WHY does he deserve a day off? he doesn't and should be in school. Maybe it's because my mom rocked, but when i didn't feel like going to school because i had a test i didn't study for or something, she let me stay home. however, that's because there was TRUST and i never broke it. This movie spits all over parental/son trust and just everyone in general. I did not find this movie enjoyable in the least. it's the second most overrated movie next to godfather and it's boring and stupid. I felt REALLY bad for the principal and thought Ferris needed to be expelled. then he could have had all the days off he wanted. i saw this for the first time when i was 15 and now i'm 22 and i STILL despise this.

869,Moon,"Has ""Existential Angst"" truly ever hit you hard?","This film is certainly going to affect different people very differently. My review is going to go down badly with many or most people no doubt. Because I like to avoid spoilers, my reviews tend to concentrate on how they affect me emotionally rather than go into a lot of plot detail. This is, in particular, a ""feelings"" review. There's a punch line, but it's a little bit of a walk first. I suffer from a serious genetic disease and am in the middle of cleaning up after an awful family tragedy. I emphatically do not believe that there is a ""Big Man in the Sky"" (or even, for that matter, a ""Flying Spaghetti Monster"") looking out for me or any other living thing. There exists no ""Grand Plan"" that we simply can't comprehend. After all, in my case, I'd have to conclude that God really had it in for me. That's pretty much the definition of a no-win situation. I have a degree in biology (honestly a minor--just a few classes short of another major--should have just finished it, since I was always at the top of the class), and I continue to read extensively in the field. The world makes sense to me. Unfortunately, it fundamentally isn't nice. (Yes, it's not quite that simple, since human beings are highly social creatures, but I'm talking about the most basic biological level--when we're nice, it's for a reason). As a blatant example of our worst, look no further than our current alpha male President. (Admittedly a very simple evolutionary analysis, but it seems appropriate for a very simple-minded primate who does not appear capable of introspection beyond that of a nonhuman great ape. Frankly, it's an open question whether or not he even actually feels any form of personal pain, although we've got the matter of empathy fully resolved.) ""Mother Nature"" is a mean old b--ch. (No misogyny intended, only playing off of an ancient, intellectually-juvenile, anthropomorphic interpretation of how the natural world operates.) We don't have to wait for ""all to be revealed"". Darwin did that quite a while back, and all we've been doing since is tidying up. If you have my biological problems and my outlook on existence, this movie might really hit you in the gut. If you've ever curled up in a ball contemplating what a brutal and lonely universe we're born into and soon pass out of, you'll totally get this film. On the other hand, if you're confident that there's some great scheme at work behind the scenes that's going to make all of the apparent human and nonhuman suffering ultimately somehow worthwhile, and you have never truly had any significant doubts about that shatter your psyche, then this film might instead seem slow and mostly hit you like water off of a duck. Who knows, as is currently popular to theorize, maybe I'm (the rest of you don't actually exist) living in some incomprehensibly-deep simulation and somebody or something is pulling strings (writing code?) and there really is some kind of plan. Or, on the other hand, my life is all some kind of cruel or meaningless entertainment. Or, on the third hand (on the internet, nobody knows you're an octopus), maybe it's really as straightforward terrible as it outright appears to be. These are the kinds of thoughts that this film reawakens, if you've ever had them. Obviously these aren't pleasant thoughts, but once you've had them, they never really leave you. That's how this film made me feel.",10.0,carbuff,2019/06/30,5,3
870,October Sky,"Review of ""October Sky""","Hmm. . .well that was refreshing. I can honestly say that after watching Joe Johnston's ""October Sky"" I feel a whole lot better about everything. Truly just an overwhelmingly inspiring and uplifting film. I mean you could take the most cynical, mysanthropic soul on this planet, have him watch ""October Sky"", and he'd have a healthier outlook on his life. I swear, during the last 10 minutes of this movie, I had the biggest grin on my face - one of those endings you just can't help but get caught up in. The film features an abundant amount of fine performances. Namely, Jake Gyllenhaal's portrayal of Homer Hickam, and Chris Cooper's compelling turn as his father, John. Other great performances came from Laura Dern, Chris Owen, William Lee Scott, and Chad Lindberg. The movie is shot to a magnificent degree. For instance, Cinematographer Fred Murphy really uses dismal lighting to magnify the miserable atmosphere within Coalwood, West Virginia. The movie is also edited to a tee. ""October Sky"" also possesses a brilliantly written screenplay that effectively tells the story with emotion as well as convey the narratives heartwarming themes. Overall, I feel that ""October Sky"" is an awe-inspiring coming-of-age tale of perseverance, respect, and hope. It's a movie that everyone can learn something from – I know I did.",10.0,compi24,2011/06/22,1,1
871,Intermission,"Fun movie, great acting and characters","Overall I thought this movie was great. A good spirit to it with some subtle humor, great intertwining storyline with a good steady pace, also some great acting and characters. Highly recommend 9 / 10. I'll be watching this one again; hell I may even buy it. Great ending too! I understand there's extra goodies on the DVD, so check that out too. Not appropriate for young kids as there's a fare bit of foul language and adult content I was impressed with all the acting in this movie, every actor was convincing and played there character well. It's based in Dublin, so heavy / authentic Irish accents throughout. I had the subtitles on the whole time, otherwise I would understand about half of what was being said (especially from Colin Farrel) and probably get lost midway through. The story jumps around between the various stories going on and how they intertwine with each other as well. It kind of reminded me of Snatch in that aspect, as well as being an English / Irish movie. This Film had an entirely different story though and I have to point out that I was impressed with overall story or should I say stories. Well thought out in that it gave you interesting events about believable people and the difficult times they are living in. It's by no means a complicated story and it more or less leads you rather keeping you guessing, but it builds off itself such that if you miss 10 minutes in the middle, it might derail you later on. I'm glad there wasn't really an emphasis on drugs but rather just focused on the events of these peoples lives as they were developing / unfolding. It's hard to comment on any specific acting by any of the actors as they were all good and very believable as the characters they portrayed. But it was a combination between great acting and great characters with some development. It had too many characters to really develop them all, but I thought the acting was so good and believable that it really sucked me into the movie. It was interesting to see Colm Meaney (chief O'Brian from Star Trek) in such a different character as the oldschool cop. The movie did have a few dry spots in the middle and if you're purely an action buff then this may not hold your interest. But as the story started to play out towards the end is when it really got good. As the climax approached I was eagerly awaiting what was coming next. I won't give anything away as I don't want to ruin it. I loved the ending and yeah, it may have been a bit foreseen and Hollywood, but I thought it was very appropriate and fulfilling. Definitely leaves you feeling good.",10.0,dcobbimdb,2004/10/22,5,0
872,October Sky,October Sky flies high,"When the Russians launched Sputnik in 1957, it was something the world viewed with great trepidation. If they had the ability to put something man-made into space, it didn't bode well for the future of the free world. The Cold War was still very much in effect, and most people thought of Sputnik as something to cast a shadow over their freedom. But Homer Hickam saw something different. He saw Sputnik not as an end in itself. But a beginning. A whole new chapter in human history was being written right before our very eyes. The people just couldn't see beyond their own fears. October Sky is one of those surprisingly charming films that even when you sense the film is tugging on the heartstrings, it doesn't feel like manipulation. Perhaps because I'm a sucker for films about the space race. Or maybe because October Sky comes from one of my favourite directors, Joe Johnston. Johnston is a filmmaker best known for rousing action/adventure films like Honey, I Shrunk the Kids and The Rocketeer. In fact The Rocketeer could almost be construed as the same film but in a slightly lesser developed form. So OS comes as a nice change of pace. Its more leisurely than Johnston's norm but that's OK. The film has excitement alright. Just of a different sort. When Homer first spots Sputnik gliding through the night sky, it is a sight that will change his life forever. Up until that point, Homer's future was very clearly mapped out for him. Once he graduates from high school, he's supposed to work in the local coal mines. Like everybody else. The mine is the town's main source of income. So its very important they get as many workers down there as they can. And for Homer, the pressure is on him especially because his father happens to be the pit foreman. John Hickam (a flawless Chris Cooper) doesn't want his son wasting his time building rockets. Homer knows his future is tied up in engineering, but John thinks the needs of their town are more important. Homer refuses to accept a life in the mines, and convinces a few other boys at school to join together and build a rocket. But the Rocket Boys (as they come to be known) face stiff opposition from just about everybody. The school principal. Their peers. And especially John. October Sky, based on the manuscript by Homer Hickam Jr is one of the nicest films you'll catch on TV. Its slightly underrated, even if its no classic. But it has a really excellent cast. And it does a surprisingly good job of sidestepping the clichés inherently buried in the narrative. There does seem a slight predictability to the film. Things like the stern, traditionalist father. The idealistic young man who dreams of the future. Opposition from all sides. The helpful teacher who's more enlightened than the rest. But surprisingly, the film succeeds more often than the above paragraph would suggest. Johnston has chosen a fine cast to remedy any possible uncertainties. Although Jake Gyllenhaal didn't make public notice until Donnie Darko, he more than proves his worth as Homer. October Sky was Gyllenhaal's first starring role. And already he shows his budding talent. Gyllenhaal always projects a fierce determination hidden behind an amiable expression. In Donnie Darko it was particularly startling. Homer of course is a complete opposite, but Gyllenhaal channels it into his ambition to prove his worth, and make a life for himself outside of a coal mine. Joe Johnston is always notable for drawing out strong, gracious performances from children, and he seems equally at home directing teenagers as well. Any scene with the Rocket Boys is thankfully devoid of over-sentiment and slush. Sometimes it threatens to. But it never boils over. And in regards to the adult cast, they do their part as well. Laura Dern is always good value and so she is here as Miss Riley, the schoolteacher open to Homer's ambitions. Her terminal illness does seem to emerge too quickly though, given a curious lack of buildup by Johnston. But its Chris Cooper who steals the show as John. He does wonders with the role of a father set in his ways. He never seems a one-dimensional tyrant. There are subtleties in his acting if you look hard enough. He may disapprove of Homer's activities, but I think hidden in his words is a grudging respect for Homer. And Cooper shows all this with a prolonged silence or a casual glance. Don't forget, John never outright stands in the way of Homer. He could have done any number of times and refuses. I think John is concerned Homer may be setting himself up to be disappointed. And wants to spare him that. John may have had ambitions at a young age too, and circumstances robbed him of that dream. Perhaps he wants to save Homer the same fate. Its all very fascinating when you think about it. A quite faultless performance on Cooper's part. There is the inevitable happy ending. And a few inevitable bumps in the road to get there. But October Sky is a fine, unpatronising film well worth your time. Plenty of 50s tunes to enjoy. And a nice consideration for the plight of the working man, and achieving what may seem hopeless dreams.",9.0,DavidSim240183,2008/01/16,1,1
873,Interstellar,"Bloated, Self-Absorbed Nonsense","All of the fanboys and girls must have also been in love with ""The Emperor Has No Clothes"" too. This story is thin, the characters are under developed, the emotional and logical shortcuts are ridiculous, Matt Damon is horribly cast and has become a caricature of himself, the set pieces are not inspiring, the music cues try to be bombastic enough to create emotion that simply doesn't exist and the science is a mess. When a self-important filmmaker reaches a level of success where no one will tell them ""no"" anymore, this is what comes of it.

874,Ferris Bueller's Day Off,When Cameron was in Egypt's land...,"""Not that I condone fascism, or any -ism for that matter. -Ism's in my opinion are not good. A person should not believe in an -ism, he should believe in himself. I quote John Lennon, ""I don't believe in Beatles, I just believe in me."" Good point there. After all, he was the walrus."" – Ferris Bueller After a short monologue on fascism, wisecracking teenager Ferris Bueller dons the hat of a Marxist revolutionary and sets off on his day of adventure. He's conned his principal into letting him stay home from school, conned his parents into thinking he's sick, and, as the day progresses, will have outsmarted a variety of authoritarian figures. Director John Hughes fills the film with discussions on European socialism, voodoo economics and shots of teachers writing the word ""prison"" on blackboards. The point: life is only worth living if you break free of all imposed structures, diverting your time to friends, art, culture, fine food and knowledge. Bueller thus embodies a kind of unconscious libertarianism, metaphorically opposed to all manners of state intervention. The ""state"" initially taking the form of ""Principal Rooney"", a bumbling careerist who exists to keep Ferris on lock-down. ""The last thing I need is fifteen hundred Ferris Bueller disciples running around these halls!"" Rooney yells. ""He jeopardises my ability to effectively govern this student body!"" But the film is really about Ferris Bueller's best friend, Cameron Frye, and his relationship with his authoritarian father, Morris Frye, an Orwellian character who ""sees everything"" despite never actually being seen. In fact, while Ferris Bueller remains a wisecracking trickster throughout the film, it is Cameron who undergoes the Hero's Journey, undergoing a full transformation and slaying his own personal antagonist at the end. Uptight, unhappy and always unwell, Cameron Frye has spent his entire life bottling up his rage and living in fear of his father. His father's house is itself a spotless tomb, everything encased in glass and plastic, nobody allowed to touch anything. Though invisible, Mr Frye's cold and oppressive means of fatherhood are felt throughout the film, weighing down on Cameron like a lead balloon. Mr Frye's presence is symbolized by his prized possession, a red Ferrari GT. The Ferrari, encased in a glass cage, perfectly polished and never used, is representative of everything Mr Frye adores. Mr Frye wants the whole world in glass, imprisoned and always under scrutiny. Ferris, of course, wants to break the Ferrari out of its cage. He wants Cameron to ride the beast. Intentionally or not, the Ferrari also conjures up images of Enzo Ferrari and fascist Italy, its sleek lines, bright red paint and fetishized machinery reminding us of Mussolini, Nazi chic, the SS and their sexy Hugo Boss designer uniforms etc. Fascism's always been aesthetically pleasing; beauty in total control. Regardless, throughout the film various characters spout the line ""Save Ferris!"" They believe Ferris to be ill and so seek to collect donations to help pay his imaginary hospital bills. The irony, though, is that Ferris organises his entire day off from school precisely because he wishes to ""Save Cameron"" from the illness caused by his father. But only Cameron can save himself. And unless he breaks free, unless he crashes that Ferrari out of its cage, he will always be ""sick"", ""nauseous"" and on the verge of suicide. In other words, the illness is not internal, its external. What's great about the film is the way this ""external illness"" is then ""internalised"" by Ferris' sister, Jeanie. Jeanie, because she isn't able to skip school, do as she pleases and con folk like her brother does, resents Ferris and wishes to see him punished. In Lacanian terms, she is the ""divided subject"", mistakenly believing that some external force is barring her from pleasure. But as Jeanie learns, she is opposed to Ferris' libertarianism for the wrong reasons. She wrongly blames her various familial and social problems on Ferris, instead of facing these problems and attempting to figure out why these conditions exist. So while Cameron's ""internal sickness"" is ""imaginary"" and is really the result of external ""social antagonists"" which he ignores, Jeanie's illness is ""internal"" and the result of an imaginary ""social antagonist"" which she invents. Significantly, these complementary characters (who never meet) are the only two people who change or have story arcs in the film. More importantly, their last act realisations are manifested through action, Cameron and Jeanie only ""alligning themselves"" with Ferris' once they slay Mr Frye and Mr Rooney respectively. This is really just a convoluted way of saying don't blame others (Jeanie) or yourself (Cameron), just identify the real target and kick its ass. If you don't, you'll end up like Cameron (suicidal, blaming one's self) or like Jeanie (bitter, blaming some phantom Other). So be strong, baby, slay your demons and be free like Ferris. Of course this then means that the Mr Rooneys and Mr Fryes of the world become unfortunate scapegoats. Principals, politicians, policemen and parents become the targets for misdirected animosity, a common flaw with all these anti-authoritarian films. In real life, the targets aren't people or figureheads. They're more invisible...elusive. 8.5/10 – Though Ferris has a poster of the obscure band ""Cabaret Voltaire"" on his bedroom wall (the French philosopher Voltaire being a sort of proto-libertarian), the film really embodies a kind of ""ignorant libertarianism"", Ferris really not ready to accept the consequences and challenges of true libertarianism. Hughes seems to know this as well, for while Jeanie and Cameron triumph, we get the sad impression that Ferris will head back to school, marry and have a fairly dull life.",,tieman64,2009/12/30,6,4
875,Spider-Man 2,See this one.,"WOW. I had low expectations after Spiderman 1. Spider Guy 2 is a blowout, take no prisoners, roller coaster ride of a film. It's got it all: great story line, edge of your seat action, romance, humor, fine acting, break neck pace, .well, you get the idea. This film is for the whole family. Great chase scenes, crashes, and special effects for the guys. Romance, and a tender love story for the gals. Comic book touches for the kids. It just works so well on every level. McGuire and Dunst have a chemistry that reminded me of Niles and Daphne in ""Frasier."" They loved each other from afar, and could not communicate their feelings to each other. The romantic tension was exquisite. So it is here with McGuire and Dunst. You know they have to get together at some point, but the long and difficult road is a journey we enjoy. The villain is definitely top shelf. Without revealing too much, suffice it to say that he's bad enough, scary enough, and convincing enough to make the film work on the plot level. The special effects are well done, especially where Spiderman has to save passengers on a speeding train. Spiderman has self doubts, begins to lose his powers, and longs to be Peter Parker instead of a superhero. He struggles with his choices in life, as we all do. He makes difficult choices, and learns that truth and integrity are rewarded, even when the results are very painful for the aunt who has replaced his mother. You might see films with a deeper message, but you won't see many films that combine action, romance, and meaning in one slick package. See this one. In fact, you may want to buy this one for your DVD library.",9.0,bilweeler,2005/07/09,181,132
876,The Chorus,Sentimental Treacle for the Eye and the Ear,"""The Chorus (Les Choristes)"" demonstrates that France is just as able to put out sentimental treacle as Hollywood, for those who thought the Gallic sensibility was inherently cynical, philosophical and intellectual or even romantic. There is a long cinematic history of similar movies. The brutal reform school lorded over by sadists genre of the British and Irish movies, such as ""If"" and ""Borstal Boy,"" usually are from the point of view of the rebellious working class inmates, while the American version usually focuses on the inspirational teacher, not necessarily of the downtrodden unless race is also a factor, such as in ""Dangerous Minds."" There's ""To Sir With Love"" which brings in all these elements. And there have been several that use music as the key, from ""Mr. Holland's Opus"" to ""School of Rock"" and ""Music of the Heart,"" some even based on true stories. The marginal originality here is that the focus is on a boys' chorus performing classical music, but I always find those angelic pre-puberty voices more creepily pure than appealing, as they are just so fleeting until their voices change. It is annoying how quickly the sympathetic chorus master molds the kids into perform-ability - there aren't even any rough rehearsals after the amusing scene where the kids reveal the little exposure they've had to any sort of songs. We're even robbed of the impact of the chorus on a key boy because the film is one long flashback. We only get a frisson of an implication of what else may have gone on in such schools as revealed in ""Bad Education (La Mala educación)."" This film is pretty to look at and listen to and saccharinely predictable.",4.0,noralee,2005/02/16,23,7
877,Ferris Bueller's Day Off,"One of a Small Number of Gen X'er Films Which Captured an Era: More Satisfying Than ""The BreakFast Club""","The so-called ""Great Generation"", those who fought in and/or came of age during and just after the Second World War, predominantly born during the First World War (circa 1910 to 1925), have been characterized as doing their duty. The Silent Generation, born circa 1925 to 1945, were known for conforming, hence they were ""silent"" on social matters instead focusing on careers and buying homes. Then came ""the Boomers"" (born circa 1946 to 1960), often associated with not only the social protests of the 1960's but also challenging the status quo. Then came Generation X, born circa 1961 to 1980. Generation X, so-called because they were largely undefinable, were about ""me"", sometimes called ""The Me Generation"". ""I want to do this, and I don't want to do that"" has been the mantra of Generation X. ""Ferris Beuller's Day Off"" is quite possibly the quintessential Generation X film about a kid who skips school to give a repressed friend the time of his life. ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" is certainly a comedy-fantasy, but unlike most comedies of the 1980's, there is an underlying message which spoke to Generation X. Certainly the message is perhaps not as deep as that found in something like ""Rebel Without a Cause"", but it does have a point to make. Through a largely innocent fantasy tale of three high school students who decide to take a day off from school without permission, they learn about life outside the classroom. They have experiences which couldn't be gleaned from text books from within the Purgatory of an American high school. The catalyst of this little adventure is Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick), a relatively intelligent but free-spirited high school-er who is determined to get the better of the school administer. He concocts a plan to fool the school and his family that he's in bed sick, which is one of the best bits in the film. His friend Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck) is in desperate need to ""get out"" and live a little bit. He suffers from hypochondria, obsessed with his health, and repressed resentment against his father. They are joined by Ferris' girlfriend Sloane Peterson (Mia Sara) where they take Cameron's dad's car for a day trip into Chicago. They explore the city by doing among other things visit art galleries, sing in the streets, and attend a Chicago Cubs' baseball game. Meanwhile, school principal Edward R. Rooney, Dean of Students (Jeffrey Jones) believes something is amiss. He's convinced Ferris is up to something and decides to expose the ""cheating"" high school-er by engaging in a chase to trap him. For Generation X'ers of the time, Ferris getting the better of a high school administrator was probably worth the price of admission when it was originally released in the 1980's. But the principal is not the only one. His sister Jeannie Bueller (Jennifer Gray) is also suspicious that Ferris is not really home in bed. She ends up having a conversation at a police station with Garth played by Charlie Sheen in a small role. This is mostly a pure fun film but strangely I found it more satisfying than ""The Breakfast Club"" also directed by John Hughes. In ""Breakfast Club"" the characters talk and talk and talk, and they dance. In ""Ferris Bueller"", the characters actually do stuff. Yes, they do dance and sing, but they do other things too. And of course Ferris, being smart enough to outsmart previous generations, gives the film it's bite. However, it's not him but another character who actually makes the biggest statement through a faux pas action, something ""The Breakfast Club"" characters never do. Sometimes I wonder what if Ferris had burst into the library where the Breakfast Clubbers were being detained and saved them from the angst of 1980's American teenage-hood. I would have paid good money to see that. In a sense, ""Ferris Bueller"" is a kind of send up to ""The Breakfast Club"", demonstrating what happens when Gen X'ers are released from Purgatory. Look out!",9.0,classicalsteve,2017/05/29,1,1
878,The Green Mile,Is the the God-given gift of healing a fitting subject for sentimentality?,"I saw this film recently late one night on television. Just happened to switch it on. I knew nothing about it (I'm not a film(""movie"") buff), didn't who it was by, or whether it was a true story or a piece of fiction. I found it too long; turned it off after about two and a half hours (too late at night/early morning). Nicely paced, though; obviously, the story takes three hours to tell, which is fair enough. I went along with much of the early parts, the death row routines, the bad apple among the little good guys; the likable inmates - bad boys once but harmless old lags now. They bring in the black guy, he's marked down as the worst of the worst: good for dramatic contrast. I assumed he was going to be the healer. He is. Fixes up Hanks, blows - what: ash? evil? corruption? - afterwards. It's then I had my first doubts. Looked like hokey was on the way. And do we get a wagon load of it! Brings the mouse back to life - bright lights please, otherwise no one will be impressed. Then the big miracle, why even the house itself rocks: must be a big big miracle. So I had my fill of hokey: turned off the TV and went to bed. Never read Stephen King. From the comments above I gather that this is a good novel by him. So I never will readStephen King. I daresay some people need this kind of sentimental mush. My main regret (other then to lament the fact that some people are so badly caught in this life that they need this kind of escapism) is that these writers and film (movie) makers should exploit such serious issues for such pathetic ends. What's wrong with romantic comedy for the escapists?. And what's wrong with plain straight-forward religion for those who might want to find some hope in this world? Why offer them this kind of straight-faced slush?",4.0,wideawake-1,2007/07/02,10,5
879,The Chorus,Positively moving,"This film is about how a teacher touched the hearts of a group of young delinquent boys with music from his heart. The plot is formulaic, as evidenced by the typical rough kids in the beginning, the lack of support from the headmaster for the choir in the middle, and the touching scenes at the end. However, I think this plot is effective and conveys the vast amount of love the music teacher has for the children. He does not love anyone less because of the way they behave. He continues to use his music to positively influence the people around him, so that the world can become a better place. The songs are amazing, so serene and touching. The final scene was very moving as well. I like this film a lot and I hope more people watch it as well!",,Gordon-11,2006/09/17,1,1
880,Interstellar,What a Waste of Space,"This truly is a shocking movie and must rank as the worst sci-fi film I have ever had the misfortune to waste 2.5hrs on. The acting is appalling with some quite amateurish edits. The music drowns out a lot of the dialogue, which is probably just as well considering its triteness. The whole premise of the plot seems to have been cobbled together by the writers after they'd endured an overkill of everything from the Lost in Space TV series of the sixties (though at least that show injected some humour into the proceedings), through to 2001 A Space Odyssey, and the innumerable Star Trek programmes and films. Any movie that casts Michael Caine as a scientific boffin must be struggling for starters. He utters, in one excruciatingly and barely decipherable scene, ""I lied"". Well he certainly didn't act! Anne Hathaway struggles to make any sense of the quite ludicrous script and often appears that she'd rather be undergoing root-canal work, whilst Matthew McConaughey mumbles and fumbles his way through lines he can't quite believe he is expected to say. The continuity is confusing and the 'special effects' only reach mediocre, adding absolutely nothing new in this genre for the viewer. I have watched hundreds of sci-fi films and programmes and do realise that we are expected to suspend belief to a greater extent, which is why a little humour would not have gone amiss - but every character in the movie seemed to be so darn miserable and brimming with angst. This film has no redeeming features whatsoever; one develops no empathy for any of the players, and there were a couple I longed would perish within a few minutes of them being introduced into the storyline (the child who portrays the ten-year old Murphy to name but one). Sorry, but this film is not worthy of wasting over two hours of your precious life on. There again, you are quite entitled to think otherwise....",1.0,theguests-southport,2014/11/14,264,120
881,Blackfish,How can anyone be surprised?,"Imagine you are in your natural habitat and you have done nothing wrong and, all of a sudden, you get followed by people on planes and boats, who relentlessly track you down, separate you from your parents and put you in a prison which has the size of an aquarium, or make that the size of a real prison cell, as you are considerably smaller than orcas. Would you develop severe mental problems as the years go by and you realize you'll never get out into freedom again? Would you start attacking your captors when you have the chance? I know, I would. The real surprise is that these Orcas mostly play along during the shows and incidents only happen once in a couple years. One of the ex-trainers interviewed for the film said that the only surprising thing was that it took so long for another fatality (experienced trainer Dawn Brancheau) and I totally agree. Yep, it says ""ex-trainer"" as all attempts from the filmmakers to interview current trainers and Sea World officials remained unsuccessful. ""Blackfish"" is really an impressive documentary. It focuses on the male orca Tilikum and also on a couple other Orcas who lived in captivity in Sealand back in the day and in Seaworld now. The focus of the film is mostly on those moments where something went wrong and people (especially trainers) were pulled underwater by the killer whales. Can you really blame them? They were taken from their world as babies and now they are taking humans from their world deep down into the water. Whenever one of these incidents happened, Sea World was very quick with their response in the form of a statement to the press that it was solely the trainer's fault. In Dawn Brancheau's case, they blamed her ponytail. All for profit and animal abuse, I guess. Just make sure money keeps coming in. The most disgusting thing, however, is that they accused the documentary makers and those who tried to get a deeper insight into her case of them being the ones who have no respect for her family and exploiting her tragedy. I thought this was so shocking and sad. The possibly biggest move away from Seaworld in the film was about an incident on the Canaries. They had a couple orcas as well, but they really weren't prepared or trained to deal with the responsibility of setting up such a show. Consequently, one trainer was killed, according to his friends and colleagues possibly even the most talented trainer they had and this section of the film is a perfect example how it's not only Tilikum, but can always happen. Orcas can not be compared to animals like tigers or sharks as they pose not really much of a danger to men even if you enter their habitat. If you take them and imprison them, it's a whole different story of course. The saddest part of the film was in my opinion when one of the captors (by now, obviously aware of the errors in his ways back then) describes very graphically the way they got the little orcas into captivity and you must be really cold at heart if you don't shed a couple tears there. Later on, there's a similar part where a young orca gets separated from its mother, both already in captivity at this point which is very moving too when we find out about the mother's reaction in the coming days and weeks, especially as scientists have discovered that orcas have a brain very different to those from men that makes them perceive everything much more emotionally and now think of how you would react if somebody took your child from you. The ending, however, was on a much more positive note as we see the former trainers meet and enter wildlife where they encounter orcas that don't live in captivity and don't have that depressingly folded dorsal fin which is so common for Orcas held in captivity and could maybe seen as an equivalent to self-mutilation for humans suffering from depression. ""Blackfish"" is the best documentary I've seen from 2013 so far and one of the five best films as well. It's emotionally investing and it worked so well for me, because I'm always eager about films that tell about animal rights (or the lack thereof). But even, if you're not usually into that as much as I am, you will probably have a ""good"" time watching ""Blackfish"", especially if you enjoyed the Academy-Award winning documentary ""The Cove"". Don't mistake it for a wildlife documentary though, it's frequently very cruel and graphic (just the way it should be with this topic) and I wouldn't recommend taking smaller children to the theater to see this.",10.0,Horst_In_Translation,2013/11/11,13,11

884,October Sky,"Surprisingly refreshing, a film with pure heart and no pretensions...","When I first saw the premise, I thought the movie would be similar to VARSITY BLUES (without the sports, of course)...somewhat cheesy and predictable. However as the story develops, one will notice that Joe Johnston actually had a well-thought out plan for this feature. The story is moving and compelling, and will affect you emotionally in ways movies like these rarely do. The reason? It's a simple movie, with a relatively familiar backdrop, but it's done very straightforwardly with no hint of pretension. At times there is some degree of predictability, but then the story takes rather unexpected turns. Just when you think you know exactly what will happen, the movie will prove your alleged clairvoyance wrong. The standout in this movie for me is the interaction between Jake Gyllenhaal and Chris Cooper. This interaction provides one of the more complex and layered father/son relationships you will see in a movie of this nature. Laura Dern also has a small role but manages it quite effectively. Moreover, much has been done to recreate the 1950s ambiance; from the costumes to the art decoration to the architecture, this movie looks and feels like it is based in the 1950s, adding to the overall viewing experience. I would recommend this for anyone looking to see a (much) better-than-average film about belief in oneself and achieving one's dreams in the face of adversity, although this movie is much more than just that. Not for those who think cheesy special effects and mind-numbingly lewd comedy are prerequisites for a good film. 3.5 stars (out of 4). 8/10.

887,The Wailing,Just When You Think You've Got It All Figured Out...,"A police sergeant is called to the scene of a grizzly murder, where the suspect is in an inexplicable state. And this is only the beginning, as more and more people in this small Korean town start going mad and killing others (and sometimes even themselves) in the process. He, his partner, and the local priest suspect a Japanese man, who has recently moved into the area, is somehow involved. And when they hear a tale told by the local tonic salesman- about a near-naked man eating from a raw deer carcass in the woods- they are driven to investigate further. They trek out towards the Japanese man's woodland haunt, and find that it's complete with skull-laden ritual chamber, and photographs of everyone who went mad, before and after their murder and/or murder/suicide sprees...which only acts to corroborate their suspicions. But, it may already be too late for the Sergeant. He discovers his daughter has been targeted, and fears for her, and his family's, safety- considering the nature of recent events, and all. This fear is justified when his daughter starts going mad: screaming & flailing; telling off her father with all manner of profanities; and threatening to murder them all. Awaking to a goat carcass with it's entrails hanging out at your front gate probably isn't a good sign either. When questioned about his involvement, the Japanese man simply replies, ""You wouldn't believe me if I told you."" So the Sergeant and his family turn to a local Shaman for help. Hoping they can figure out what is really going on, and do what they can to protect themselves. He reveals, to them, that the suspected Japanese man is actually a ghost- or more accurately a demon...and he's out to get the Sergeant for wronging him. What follows is nothing short of an epic battle of dark vs light, as the two shaman's face off, ritualistically, in an attempt to hex each other to death. But, perhaps things are not exactly as they seem...just when you think it is over... As someone who is interested in Shamanism, I really enjoyed this film! It's quite long at over 150 minutes runtime, but it keeps you intrigued by slowly unraveling the mystery, then totally shifting gears once you think you've got it all figured out. Despite being oriented around zombies, ghosts and demonic possession, the storyline comes off as wholly original...which is not such an easy feat in today's saturated horror-market. And that ending had me on the edge of my seat!!! When all you have is faith to go on, which side would you choose...? The Wailing is an intriguing blend of crime, horror, mystery and dark comedy, that plays with dichotomies in interesting ways, and keeps you in the dark up until the very last moment. It is finely constructed and extremely entertaining. Definitely worth a watch. Highly recommended. 7.5 out of 10.",7.0,meddlecore,2016/10/09,18,8
888,October Sky,"you can read ""Rocket Boys"" before or after watching the movie, and they're still both really good","I think that we can now say that Jake Gyllenhaal's troika of great roles are ""October Sky"", ""Donnie Darko"" and ""Brokeback Mountain"" (""The Day After Tomorrow"" was also worth seeing). In the first one, he plays 1950s West Virginia teenager Homer Hickam. In their small town, the men work in the coal mine and it's assumed that all the boys will go into that line of work - or become jocks. Then, in October, 1957, the Soviet satellite Sputnik glides across the sky. Homer realizes that he wants to go into that line of work, so he and his friends start making test rockets. Needless to say, Homer's family is shocked at this, and the local jocks don't like it either. But Homer knows his desire, and he and his friends keep at it. If Jake Gyllenhaal was relatively unknown when this movie came out, then it surely cemented him as a talented presence on the silver screen. Equally great in the movie are Chris Cooper as Homer's coal miner father, who is nervous about his son doing this, and Laura Dern as Homer's teacher, who encourages him. All in all, very well done.",8.0,lee_eisenberg,2006/04/25,1,1
889,Horrible Bosses 2,"Could be worse, but it would be a total disaster","The movie is nothing more than an horrific experiment: is the audiences taste is nonexistent? Are they so simple that they'll like a shallow story and same 'ol jokes for dummies? Horrible Bosses 2 is not dumb, it's dumber. The humor is immature (I guess, that's a standard for nowadays so-called-comedies), plot is flat as an hand-egg field, but the worst part is the yelling and the ""idiocracy"" of the main characters. They yell almost all the time, talking all at once, screaming words and dancing their erratic dance of ""having nothing better to do with themselves cause of that nonexistent quality of the script""*. So they yell, scream and... And they are dumber then Lloyd Christmas and Harry Dunne from ""Dumb and Dumber"". But Lloyd and Dunne are likable - they are just two heavy cases of idiocy, of being dumb - two dumb chumps, funny and sweet in their dumbness, with some characteristics, a soul - one could say. What about Nick, Dale and Kurt? Nothing. They are soulless and mindless, without the spark of life - characters that you'll forget in no time cause they're like thousands more produced by so many. And I guess it's not entirely actors fault, no. It's the script, the director and so on. This movie is almost as bad as Jack and Jill, but less entertaining for sure. *that's the name of the ancient Indian dance",1.0,veritas-deus,2015/02/15,77,40

Whales are huge animals and no matter how much training they receive, they will always be wild animals with an hunting instinct.

891,Intermission,Very funny movie.,"This is probably the funniest Irish movie ever made. The acting and script are both top drawer. I realise it is a movie for people with a certain dry sense of humor. A previous reviewer commented that the actors did well with the Irish accents! I would like to point out that most of the actors in the film are from Ireland. Cillian Murphy, Colm Meaney, Colin Farrell, Deirdre O'Kane are all from Ireland. If you have the ability to laugh at things that would not be possible in normal day life, then this is the film for you. It is set in inner city Dublin and set around the lives of several different characters and their interweaving stories. Colm Meaney portrays a hard as nails detective 'Jerry Lynch' and it is without doubt the stand out performance of the film. It is a comical performance and each line is delivered perfectly. Colin Farrells performance will not disappoint fans. If anyone has ever had first experience with Dublin scumbags, then they will understand how good he is in this. Mind you, it probably comes natural to him! His fascination for woks is hysterical. This movie makes it easy for people not to take their own lives so serious and will have you laughing endlessly from start to finish. It's a comedy, enjoy.",10.0,robdreilly,2009/09/08,3,1
892,October Sky,Inspirational,"I loved this movie. It is one of the few movies that I have consistently recommended to friends to rent and have had all of them thank me for the referral. The film has some powerful themes that are beautifully scripted. The acting is superb all around (Chris Cooper has never turned in a bad acting role in my opinion!) The message of this film is so well delivered, so powerful, that it moved me to tears the first time I saw it. Not sad tears, which are easily solicited by cinema formula, but tears of joy--a rare thing. Although I did not grow up in the 1950's, I believe this film honestly portrays the mood and setting of the time. Given today's harsh world with all its complications, watching this film is a welcome escape to a time of innocence, wonder, and discovery. Highly recommended!",,seagorn,2004/07/31,89,80
893,Ferris Bueller's Day Off,Ferris Was My Hero,"Ferris Bueller had it all, and I wanted to be that for at least one day. Always in control, with the pretty girl, relying on goofy friend only to boss him around and critique him when things do not go my way, having the entire school worshiping me, and watching authority figures fumble all over themselves falling into my ingenious traps. He was everything I wanted to be. As the years roll by, I am content to be the Cameron I am. It's OK to be average. There's nothing wrong with insecurity, fear, and not knowing what the future holds. These truths is what makes the movie great. It takes you places, and hyper-focuses on the character development. Some moments are fast paced and hilarious. Then it slows down and gets very symbolic. The pacing of the movie is simply incredible. As for the story, it is cheesy. I might even go as far as to say it is predictable. All the same, it takes you back to the characters, which turn out some of the most memorable moments in movie history.",8.0,dprkforum,2017/06/13,1,1
894,Death of a Salesman,Hoffman as Loman does it again,"This TV adaptation of Arthur Miller's most successful play benefits from the serious playing of Dustin Hoffman in the lead as failing salesman Willy Loman. Miller's play takes the plight of the common man within the confines of the 'American dream' and then kicks him down. Loman's sons are played by John Malkovich (Biff, memorable) and Stephen Lang (Happy, irritating); while his wife is played with tact and resignation by Kate Reid. The stagey feel of this production comes across in every scene (the famous ones especially with Howard, Loman's boss; and Bernard, the successful son of Loman's colleague; and the final scenes with Linda) although they are handled very well. It would be a temptation to dismiss Willy Loman as loopy and in the throes of a breakdown and to ignore everything he says, but his words strike a chord and stay with you. 'Death of a Salesman' still has something to say to us, and a warning to give, even six decades after it was written.",,didi-5,2004/12/05,16,12
895,Moon,Great Movie If You Want It To Be,"Moon is a philosophical film at heart, examining a variety of complex subjects and dilemmas with a precise and perfect manner, mirroring the voice of its robot servant Gerty and the emptiness of the base itself. This is both the source of its beauty and a few problems. (Spoiler Alert) Although the beginning of the film gives us the usual stark view of the ""astronaut alone,"" common in all well-done space movies and in this case especially derivative of the original Solaris, it is in Sam's discovery that the film really takes flight and becomes something exciting and new. Sam Rockwell gives a stunning performance, playing multiple versions of Sam Bell with great care and delicacy, making each clone new and yet the same; totally different from the often unintentionally comedic performances a role like that can manifest. But the subtlety of Rockwell's performance, when combined with the starkness and quiet of the base, can make the film feel mechanical to the unprepared viewer. Rockwell doesn't force his audience to feel for him. It's something that occurs only when you take time out from the screen to examine just how lonely, terrifying, and unfair Sam's experience is. You have to explore Sam's plight on your own. It is up to you to unravel the multitude of layers and depths swimming beneath the surface of this intricate story or take them at face value, an aspect of the film that can potentially leave many viewers understandably unsatisfied and unmoved. One of the emotional surprises in the film does come from Sam's interaction with Gerty the robot, his only companion. Gerty is the best on screen portrayal of a robot ""friend"" to date. He takes great care of Sam, not because he feels for Sam, but because that is logically the best thing for him to do, and yet he does his job well. He is neither sinister or abnormally compliant, his emoticon ""face"" lending the film an at times eerie and other times emotive component that feels more realistic and effective then his counterparts like HAL or Robbie the Robot. I loved the film, was compelled as I watched it, and unable to easily leave it behind once I left the theater. But I also didn't leave with a strong emotional response, despite my understanding of the broad horrors of that Sam was facing. I'm not sure if that's a bad thing or not; maybe it depends on which version of me was watching.",9.0,blogandsqualor,2009/07/25,33,23
896,October Sky,"Interesting, entertaining and heart-warming","It is October 1957 and the USSR has launched Sputnik 1, the first satellite. In a small town in West Virginia a 17-year-old boy, Homer Hickam, is fascinated by this development and is determined to build and launch his own rocket. He enlists the help of three friends in his endeavour. However, coal mining is all that people know in those parts and they will face stiff opposition, most of all from Homer's own father, the manager of the local mine. Interesting story, based on Homer Hickam's book ""Rocket Boys"". Seems conventional but the plot has enough twists and turns to prevent it from being unoriginal and predictable. Very entertaining at times, as we see the boys' adventures, struggles, failures and successes in building and launching the rocket. There's also a great human element to the drama: Homer's relationship with his father, the teacher's interest in the project succeeding, the constant danger that awaits those that take the town's usual profession - coal mining. This adds a sentimental and emotional element to the movie that ultimately results in some great heart-warming moments. Jake Gyllenhaal, in his first starring role, is great as Homer Hickam. While this movie didn't truly launch his career, his next would: Donnie Darko. Good work by Chris Cooper as his father and Laura Dern as Miss Riley, his teacher. Solid supporting cast.",8.0,grantss,2020/04/25,1,1
897,Primal Fear,Decent thriller that relies heavily on a solid cast.,"Rating: ** 1/2 out of **** Here's a film I remembered being a huge fan of back when I first saw it in theaters in '96. Seeing it again for the third time since, it doesn't quite live up to my fond memories. Aside from Edward Norton's scene-stealing performance as suspect Aaron Stampler, there's really not much about the film that separates it from most of the genre. The plot, concerning the murder of a beloved archbishop at the alleged hands of an innocent-looking altar boy and the eventual high-profile trial, is certainly rife with potential but is never executed beyond the level that's expected of a competent pulp thriller. But credit should be given where it's due, especially the first hour of the film, which does a pretty solid job of setting up the film as an engrossing mix of murder mystery and courtroom drama. The performances are all solid, with Richard Gere providing yet another effective variation of the slick, cocky persona (this time as a ""big-shot attorney"") he's mastered and Laura Linney acting convincingly stressed out and aggravated by the understandably vexing situation her character's been placed in. But with all the pieces in place in the first half, the film never quite results in the tight, suspenseful thriller we expect. The most noticeable problem is excess baggage, with the film too often straying from the case at hand and veering towards less interesting tangents. There's just too much chaff here, with subplots that include the romantic tension between Linney and Gere, the writer doing the article on Vail, and the housing development project that simply takes up too much of the movie's already overlong running time. Equally problematic is a major plot twist halfway through which, while effective in its own right and allows the opportunity for Norton to stretch his considerable acting talent, ultimately lessens the speculative tension that these thrillers usually rely on. From that point on, most of the enjoyment is derived from Norton's performance, and though it's not quite the show-stopper I once considered it to be (probably doesn't help I just saw this flick after his absolutely incredible performance in American History X), it's still one of the better debut performances any actor has ever put forth. It's with some relief that I can at least say the film saves its best scenes for last (the last three minutes are quite memorable), and definitely finishes things off on a high note. Primal Fear was directed by Gregory Hoblit, who's actually proved himself a pretty skillful filmmaker when it comes to crafting thrillers. This one's merely competent, no more and no less.",,Li-1,2006/10/10,63,37
898,Moon,Starring Sam Rockwell... (and also starring)...,"Sam Rockwell. Sam Rockwell is one of the greatest actors we have right now so i was (obviously) impossibly excited for 'Moon' and I went to see it yesterday. In short, the film was so amazing that after it finished, I didn't want to move... ever again. I was also excited to see the film because of the director (Duncan Jones) and the fact that it was filmed in 33 days on a super-low budget. A low-budget space movie like this should have been near impossible, but Moon looks way more amazing than films with way bigger budgets. Sam Rockwell is impossibly good as 'Sam Bell' and watching him fall apart made me pretty emotional. He plays the character(s) like the roll of a dice, switching from angry and manic one minute to helpless and desperate the next. Moon is part 1960's/70's space movie homage, and this was a total throw back to the 'WTF is happening' sci-fi movies that kinda got lost with the new ways of cinema. The film isn't over-complicated but it throws you into the vast unknown and leaves you with unanswered questions, which is the best way to end things. The main question in Moon is 'What would you do if you met yourself?'... and I guess throwing space into the equation makes the whole thing even scarier to think about. You would still be lonely, even if there were more of you. I'd be lonely. Inside, I am completely geeking out over Moon. But I won't write it all on here because I don't want to spoil it for anyone. Even if you're not that into sci-fi... I'd still really urge you to see this film. I'm still on another planet because of it... (pun intended) and Moon is pure space escapism at it's best.

899,Blackfish,Cautionary Tale About Killer Whales Showing the Limitations of Human Understanding,"BLACKFISH tells the story of Tilkum, a killer whale bred in captivity, who ended up taking the lives of several people, most recently trainer Dawn Brancheau. Many reviewers have already commented on the ways in which director Gabriela Cowperthwaite uses the documentary to comment on the ways in which Seaworld exploits the killer whales for financial gain, while claiming to treat them humanely. What perhaps emerges most tangibly from her narrative is the limitations of human understanding surrounding these creatures; they are either perceived as friendly, cuddly creatures or as killer predators. Little attempt has been made to try and construct alternative behavioral models that take into account the fact that killer whales are highly intelligent creatures who think and react in certain ways in the wild. While the documentary includes several interviews with experts in whale behavior, it seems that they are lone voices: many of the former Seaworld trainers - who provide evidence of the ways in which captive whales were treated - come across as well-meaning yet basically ignorant. They were perfectly content to parrot Seaworld's official propaganda to incredulous audiences, but spent little time or energy trying to discover things for themselves. In that sense BLACKFISH comes across as a cautionary tale of how capitalism constructs false dreams that often prove so convincing that no one bothers to try and challenge them. As a result, it is the killer whales that suffer. The fact that such creatures strike back is seldom due to the fact that they are ""angry"" or ""resentful"" of their trainers, but rather borne out of frustration with a life in which they absolutely no power of self-determination. BLACKFISH is an angry documentary, but is no less compelling for being so.",8.0,l_rawjalaurence,2014/04/29,8,7
900,Crash,Simply overrated,"When I heard about this movie I was genuinely excited to see it. The cast seemed solid and the plot outline gripped my attention. The lesson I learned: You can't judge a film by it's cast. I almost didn't get through watching this entire movie. By the time I hit the 1 hour mark, I almost shut it off. It's that bad. I'm stunned at how graciously people have received this movie, labeling it ""electrifying"", ""brilliant"", or some other tired adjective. The characters were all one-dimensional and wooden. I've never seen Fraser deliver dialog with such a constipated effort. I kept looking for the string in his back. And he's just one example of what you'll find throughout this travesty of modern cinema. Bullock's character should have just been cut from the movie entirely as she adds absolutely nothing to this film. The pace of the movie is also distracting. It jumps around far too much and the dialog is ridiculous and labored. You never get a chance to get involved or to really relate to any of the characters. And in a way, they are all so miserable and arrogantly tragic, that you don't even want to. People are praising this movie for the message it sends about racism. The only message I got out of this movie was; avoid miserable, violent people. Racism hardly seems the focus of this movie when you break it down. All of these characters are simply assholes. There is nothing of value to learn from watching this. If you want a true lesson in racism from film, watch American History X. They got it right. This movie gets it completely wrong.",1.0,Rat-4,2005/10/11,130,70

I even can't find right word to give you proper review (partly because English is not my native)and summarization won't give the movie justice. The only thing I regret that I watched it dubbed (though in my country dubbing is really good) I advice t go see the movie alone on yourself as I did and it will pull you in from the first frame to this epic journey!

902,Crash,A quintessence for what a bad movie is like,"In the category of ""let's impress semi-simple minded people"" it's probably the most over-driven movie. Nothing is interesting or thought-provoking, everything is stereotypical, vapid, predictable, spoon-fed, and obtruded, the scenes and dialogs are flat, so there's nothing to highlight about this movie, which is compensated by attitudinizing on such an enormous level that is unequaled, it's horrible!! I apprehend that the characters were meant to be stereotypical, so that each of them would represent a general example of each kind of people, but these characters went rather cliché-kind than realistic or objective, especially the nerve-racking goofy black guy one (this goes off pretty bad for this movie, doesn't it?). You can't even book this movie as constructive, as it focuses on racism so much that it draws away the attention from the presence of hate in general. The message of the movie helps people stay superficial and reinforces their confidence in their immature moral views, because it belongs to those movies that make narrow-minded people think about unimportant banal things, which makes their urge for thinking about what really matters fulfilled. Probably that's why it was projected in one of our main squares, for free. (That's where i saw the movie.) I don't rate 1 star because it's overrated. It's one of the worst movies i remember seeing, a shame that it's in the top 250, this weakens the authenticity of IMDb stats as well. EDIT (12-2009): as far as can i remember, there is actually one nice message, (*spoiler ahead*) when officer John Ryan ""becomes good"", which may suggest that no one can be judged by the surface.",1.0,leafface,2007/07/01,19,13
903,Taxi Driver,Dead end streets...,"Travis Bickle is the sort of person you wouldn't even see if you encountered him on the street -- and if you did take note of him, you would make a point to ignore him. He is a non-entity. In his role as a cabbie, you would be aware of him only in the same way you would notice the color of the upholstery or be aware of a strange smell inside the cab. On the rare occasion that Travis might make his presence felt, you would tolerate his existence -- maybe even graciously acknowledge him with a smile or a noncommittal comment. You would only remember Travis if he said or did something particularly rude or offensive or bizarre; and then only as long as you might remember what you had for lunch or what your horoscope said. There is no reason to remember, or to feel bad about not remembering, a Travis Bickle because he has no real effect on your life. He does a job, he fills a space; just like millions of other anonymous everyday workers. But the sad thing about Travis is that he has no real effect on anyone. Most people have a life -- family, friends, interests, a purpose beyond being part of the machinery. Travis only has a job. You would not notice Travis, but Travis might notice you. And judge you: He might decide that you are part of what makes life worth tolerating, but more likely he might see you as part of what makes the world an unbearable hell. It is the nature of film that when it casts an eye toward the ""little guy,"" the attempt is to show that the ordinary man has something extraordinary about him that society is missing -- even if that is just an everyday niceness. This being a Martin Scorsese film, written by Paul Schrader, filmmakers with a near-suicidal view of mankind, the point of TAXI DRIVER is just the opposite. If Travis Bickle is a remarkable person in any sense, it is in a negative way. Travis is not a good man; he is petty and mean-spirited and bigoted and self-absorbed and judgmental. He views the world with contempt; he has to, he has to have more hate for the world than he has for himself. TAXI DRIVER is the story of a man living the proverbial life of quite desperation. In self-imposed isolation, Travis is mentally unstable, and probably was long before the film starts. The film supposedly is loosely based on THE SEARCHERS, but it has much more in common with PSYCHO. Travis, like Norman Bates hides his insanity behind a facade of banality and nurses it with his loneliness. Insignificant men with a significant amount of pent up anger. The main difference -- and it is a telling difference -- is that we don't see Norman's rage until the end, it takes us by surprise; while we never doubt that Travis has inner demons. What Travis does is a foregone conclusion. Paul Schrader's dark, oppressive script pointedly refers to Travis as a walking contradiction, often at the cost of the story's credibility. He's not particularly bright and at times almost shockingly slow, but his journal entries are surprisingly articulate. He declares a woman to be ""an angel,"" but is dismayed that she is offended by being taken to a porno film. He claims to have an honorable discharge from the marines, yet he seems to have been born yesterday, not even knowing the meaning of a common phrase like ""moonlighting."" Schrader's superficial screenplay is long on obscenities and racial slurs, but short on simple logic. The shortcomings of the script are offset to a great degree by solid performances and Scorsese's stylish direction. As Travis, Robert DeNiro is in virtually every scene and even though the screenplay falters at various times, DeNiro holds the film together with a consistency of tone and insight. Forgoing his usual bombastic method posturing (during most of the film), DeNiro plays Travis with a compassion that makes this otherwise horrid little man pitiable, if not sympathetic. He makes us care for Travis, even though the story offers us no real reason to. Jodie Foster, playing the child prostitute to whom Travis hopes to play savior, still has the youthful freshness and wise innocence that made her a treasure as a child actress. (Though I have trouble respecting Scorsese for casting a 13-year-old child, even one as mature and worldly as Foster, in a part that is so squalid and degrading.) Scorsese sees in Travis' New York City a teeming cesspool, but with cinematographer Michael Chapman, he makes it the most photogenic cesspool imaginable. He doesn't romanticize New York, but he does romanticize Travis' seething hatred of the city. However, he does wisely counterpoint Travis grubby view of the world with a sense of a real world, where friends and coworkers joke and talk and, well, exist. Unlike RAGING BULL, GOODFELLAS and CASINO, Scorsese films where psychotic characters exist in closed worlds where their lunatic behavior seems the norm, TAXI DRIVER underscores Travis' outsider status by giving us a realistic world that he is isolated from. As such, TAXI DRIVER has an honesty that his other violent epics lack. But Scorsese provides us with at least two scenes that ring utterly false. His own gratuitous cameo as a passenger graphically boasting of his plans to murder his wife seems to be Scorsese's way of showing that there are people who are even crazier than Travis. Why? To suggest that Travis is justified in his paranoia? Also the final climatic bloodbath provided only a cheap shock at the time and now seems like a tiresome cliché of special effects gore. Such over the top mayhem doesn't underscore the brutality of the violence, it trivializes the rest of the film. TAXI DRIVER, like DeNiro's performances, is best in its still moments of quiet desperation. The irony of the violence is that it eventually makes Travis famous, though it could have just as easily have made him infamous. The bullets that kill the pimp could have killed the politician. In Travis' mind they are pretty much the same. Unfortunately, I don't think some people get that. Travis, in the end, is not a hero, he is a murder. He is not purged of his demons; they are just temporarily placated. The famed ""you talking' to me?"" scene has reached iconic status, symbolic of tough-guy cool -- not unlike Dirty Harry's ""Make my day."" But both Travis and Harry are dangerous icons; filmgoers delude themselves into accepting their insane displays of violence because the right make-believe characters get killed. They are protected by the fantasy of film; in the real world they would eventually be revealed to be the monsters. To his credit, Scorsese at least suggests that in the end Travis Bickle is still insane, and armed and dangerous. Even so, the ending is uncomfortably ambiguous: I don't think that Scorsese is as afraid of Travis' insanity as he is in awe of it.",8.0,majikstl,2004/06/28,33,16
904,Horrible Bosses 2,Rate this 'R' for Raunchy,"First, I didn't see the original, so I wasn't sure what to expect. i was hoping for a pleasant comedy and expected the what-seems-to-be-prerequisite bathroom humor and some profanity. What we see is another movie that has a decent plot, for this type of comedy, but once again writers with a small vocabulary. It seems as if a third of the dialogue is made up of the f-word. While the sex-addiction sub-plot could be amusing, it went way to far (no pun intended)--with lines suitable for a porn movie. I was never a huge Jennifer Aniston fan, I lost a lot of respect for her with this movie. I believe Hollywood has a responsibility--because we give them so much of our money--to reinforce some levels of decency, if only with language. It seems that nearly every movie is trying to top ""Wolf of Wall Street"" for the raunch-factor, regardless of whether it has anything to do with the plot (and it did in ""Wolf""). Some studios and actors manage to make entertaining movies without lowering themselves--why not all? It adds NOTHING to these films and only serves to send our young people the message that this is an appropriate way to communicate.",3.0,blufrog49,2014/12/09,23,10
905,Moon,"Brilliantly executed, fascinating, and involving","The most important issue we may face in the future is whether rapid advances in science and technology will change human beings into disposable resources, utilitarian subjects manipulated by indifferent centers of corporate power. Moon, the thought provoking and thoroughly engrossing first feature from U.K. director Duncan Jones, son of the pop singer David Bowie, tackles these questions and raises others that have been pondered since man first set foot on this planet – Who are we? Where did we come from? What is our purpose on this planet? Though the answers do not come as easily as the questions, Moon attempts to recapture the science fiction genre from the mindless action-adventure films we have become accustomed to and brings it to a level, perhaps not seen since the classic Kubrick film 2001. Filmed on soundstages in England and set in an unspecified future time, Moon opens with a mock commercial by the Japanese corporation Lunar Industries. The Corporation has developed a technique to use the rocks on the moon to produce Helium-3, a substance that can fulfill mankind's most pressing energy needs. Their mining facility on the far side of the moon is manned only by Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) and a Hal-like robot named Gerty (voice of Kevin Spacey) who communications emotions through a smiley face display while reflecting company programming. Lonely and emotionally at loose ends, Sam is nearing the end of a three-year stint and is looking forward to return home in two weeks to see his wife (Dominique McElligott) and young daughter with whom he is only able to communicate via video recording since direct communication is temporarily out of service. When hallucinations of his lovely wife standing before him cause Sam to crash his Lunar Rover, the film takes a strange turn and never looks back. Sam wakes up in the infirmary and begins his recovery process under strict orders from Gerty not to go outside of the base. Astoundingly, Sam sees a younger version of himself who claims to have arrived to serve the same three-year contract that Sam began many years ago. Raising issues about the nature of identity and the perversion of human life by scientific and corporate power run amok, the film becomes a desperate struggle against the clock to reclaim one's humanity before a so-called rescue operation arrives to set things in order. Moon is not preachy nor does it treat the corporation as the villain incarnate. Without special effects or bombastic battle scenes, this low-budget film simply presents the possibility of what could happen if human consciousness does not keep pace with advances in genetic engineering. As such, it is brilliantly executed, fascinating and involving, and contains an outstanding double role performance by Indie star Sam Rockwell who is completely convincing as the confused and lonely astronaut who plays ping pong with himself. Director Duncan Jones and screenwriter Nathan Parker have combined the intelligence of Solaris with the chilling power of Alien to produce a work that challenges us to reconnect with our souls.",9.0,howard.schumann,2009/07/12,42,27

Dracula is a well-known brand originally from ROMANIA, and speaking of, I'd like to forward a reminder to the producers of this movie that Transylvania is part of Romania and that Budapest(which is the capital of Hungary) is not part of Transylvania but BUCHAREST, hence here's the worst grade possible for this very bad (unwilling) mistake. I was disgusted about this and I'd like to warn all other potential viewers NOT TO WATCH THIS MOVIE unless they'll fix this problem and, once and for all, so everybody will bear in mind this, TRANSYLVANIA = ROMANIA = BUCHAREST(capital of Romania)",1.0,cishmigiu,2012/11/02,30,11

909,Intermission,An Excellent Irish Film,"Ireland's cinema rarely, if ever, swims its way across the Atlantic to find a home in American theaters. Of course, you've got the excellent work of Jim Sheridan, which in addition to its mass appeal traffics to some extent in the depiction of Irish life (in a sense, whether his work is about Ireland or individual Irish men and women - Christy Brown, himself, Gerry Conlon - is debatable, but his work still consistently details life upon that island). You also have Neil Jordan who infrequently works on projects that concern his native land (Michael Collins, though not particularly good, and the Butcher Boy represent the obvious exceptions. There have been many great Irish films, such as Cal or December Bride or Hush-A-Bye-Baby that, though high in quality, have made little impact in America. Intermission, a new and very Irish film, announces John Crowley as, perhaps, the next Irishman to join the ranks of Jordan and Sheridan as a world-renowned director. Deftly weaving the intricate stories of Mark O'Rowe and employing a large, Altman-esque cast, Crowley creates a convincing portrait of contemporary Irish life. What I especially enjoyed about it, though, was its typically Irish flavor. Most notably, the dialogue, though occasionally garbled to American ears, never elevates itself above dialect. O'Rowe and Crowley could have chosen, as Sheridan or Jordan have done, to allow their characters to speak in a more accessible, British manner. They do not. They want the lyricism and violence of the Irish - particularly the Dublin - brogue at the fore-front. Using the cadences of the Dublin accent and typically Irish turns of phrase, O'Rowe and Crowley succeed, through the use of language, in creating a film that never disconnects from its setting. The plot too, with its concerns of love and violence, is typically Irish. Yes, Pulp Fiction with its combination of violence and every-day concerns represents a touchstone for this picture, but, I believe, the literary output of the nation represent a more direct ancestor to this film. Look at the plays of Synge and Shaw, look at Roddy Doyle's work, look at John Banville, look at Heaney's poems... Love and violence have long been the central concerns of Irish literature (and film, too, Cal being an excellent example). That this film centers upon John's love life and criminal escapades and that this film opens with a scene depicting the oppositional forces of love and war owes far less to Quentin Tarantino, I would say, than it does to Doyle in particular but Synge, Shaw, Boucicault, etc. to a lesser extent. Speaking of that opening scene, I would like to dwell upon its brilliance for only a moment. I've read, in regards to this scene, that it bears a resemblance to the opening of Pulp Fiction. Though in a rudimentary way it does, this scene has a far greater impact on the audience. Pulp Fiction does not lull you into a sense of security; the movement towards violence is swift. In Intermission, the scene, happily going along a well-traveled course, quickly changes direction and takes us completely by surprise. It's a terrific piece of editing and directing and acting and it's truly among the greatest opening scenes in recent years. But I've spent much time praising the film for its Irishness and little praising its other qualities. The acting is fantastic. Colm Meaney, Cillian Murphy, and Colin Farrell are talented men and the women - KellY MacDonald and Shirley Henderson in particular - are their equals here. (Shirley Henderson is a wonderful actress, by the way, and should receive higher-profile work). The hand-held digital camera work is an excellent fit as well, capturing the routines of these people's lives in crisp, unflattering detail. All that said, the movie's ending is completely un-satisfactory. It's rushed and formulaic, and, while the rest of the film is more about these people than plot, the ending reverses that. There's also a few moments of Hallmark sentimentality that is at odds with the film's overall tone; there moments also induce cringes. On the whole, though, it's a solid film and an enjoyable one. As a first time feature for both the writer and director, it's a stellar job. I doubt it will disappoint you.",,jay4stein79-1,2004/11/19,12,5
910,Moon,Nothing short of astounding,"This was the best movie I have seen in a very in a very long time and immediately jumps into my favorite movies ever. MOON puts a relatable human touch on an intriguing and deep sci-fi story that, while it originally appears to be taking the path of 2001 Space Odyssey, is a unique adventure. Sam Rockwell puts on a spellbinding performance and Kevin Spacey's GERTY voice-over is eery and excellent. I have never seen a movie that had me so engrossed and intrigued from beginning to end. Some may say the film starts slowly but I found the first half hour to be an important and gripping portrayal of what it would mean to be alone in space, without which the movie would not be as effective. I don't want to ruin the plot so I wont go into further detail. As an avid movie watcher who is not a sci-fi buff I would recommend this movie to anybody who wants to see a movie that will take over their lives for 2 hours and have you leave the theater wanting to do nothing but discuss how beautifully layered it was.",10.0,breaknthrugh,2009/06/24,381,308

I tried, I really tried hard, to watch it to the end but couldn't. I would have more chance of getting a laugh if I caught my private part in a zipper.

It's a hilarious and often jolting crime comedy/romance that has at least 40 different characters intertwining together in Dublin, Ireland. The cast is amazing, Colin Farrell, Colm Meaney, Kelly MacDonald, Cillian Murphy and many other familiar Irish faces that you might recognize if you're not a native Irish person and if you're a huge Cillian fan who has grabbed up everything you can with him in it. There is a badass cop who aspires to be a reality TV star; a dangerous criminal who has no qualms about hitting women in the face; a heartbroken wife who has some pent up rage that leads to very rough sex; a confused and hurt couple who have broken up for a very stupid reason; an unhappy bus driver who gets involved in a dumb scheme; a lonely and traumatized woman who really needs facial waxing, and a very sadistic little boy who seems to be the catalyst for this hullaballooo. If you are a relatively new Cillian fan and have enjoyed him in PERRIER'S BOUNTY, this is very similar. A funny and intense crime comedy. Highly recommended.",10.0,PeachHamBeach,2012/08/26,0,0

916,The Wailing,"Ambitious, but scattered in terms of focus.","The Wailing was an excellent effort and I badly wanted to enjoy it given the way critics have been raving. Instead, it left me frustrated and praying for the end credits repeatedly. I sort of liked the ending and the atmosphere of the film was fantastic, but overall it fell short of being truly enjoyable. I saw it twice in order to understand what spoiled the experience for me, and upon contemplation I think it was because the film, overall, lacked focus. I don't think we needed to sit through two and a half hours of it in order to reach the conclusion that it did, particularly since there are still a number of things in the film which do not add up by the time it ends. I feel like the editing -- in terms of tightening the storyline -- could have been much better. Atmosphere is an important aspect of any horror film, but you don't need two and a half hours to build it and the flow of the story should never be compromised. Moreover, great atmosphere is pointless if you don't actually do anything with it, and this film didn't -- at least not until the last fifteen minutes or so. Another thing that made it difficult to sit through once (and nearly unbearable to sit through a second time) was the lack of a ""good"" character whom I truly liked. I know that it's a thing to be annoyed with some characters in a horror movie (""Too Stupid To Live"" is a trope for a reason), but this is the first film where I actively cheered for the evil side to win before the end. I don't want to give anything away, because I do think that this is a film that should be seen (especially since my opinion of it appears to be an outlier), but do prepare yourself to be completely aggravated by the characters' behavior in this film. If that was what the director was going for, then well done.",1.0,azey13,2016/12/30,107,46
917,Detachment,Detachment (2012) : A Review!,"Detachment is an awesome movie directed by Tony Kaye and another finest role by Adrien Brody. The film is based on modern ironic society where young students are the victims of dystopian world to fulfill the goals that is not easy. Achieving everything is nothing, the truth! It's easy to get spoiled and earn money in a wrong way, but hard to face the truth. In this film there is a lesson that we must try to learn. Bright young souls are getting dark without guidance, motivation, and care. Students are getting frustrated about the outburst society, parents blaming on teachers, teachers blaming on the students, politics is behind! Corruption, power, domination, enchanted like two-faced god! Love is getting very physical. Relationship has no emotion, no feelings. Daily life is getting filled-up with bad slang. Teachers are helpless to educate. Parents are neglecting their own children. This is the present social scenario of advanced educated countries and the future of developing countries. We are ironically educated to hide the truth. We have eyes to see the right, but we act the blind. Shame on whom? Shame is detaching us from us!

919,Moon,Who's the joke on here?,"If there is one set of words that should be banned from usage on this website I'd vote for 'Thought provoking'. A phrase that is once again littered throughout an unfathomable amount of positive reviews this clunky effort at filmmaking has somehow garnered. A film so bereft of ideas worth exploring and executed with such inauthenticity, it really has to be seen to be believed. Let us even forget about the shoddy outfits, the borrowed sets, the stolen characters and the standard Casio Keyboard demo-tunes trying desperately to masquerade as a soundtrack. Let's not even begin to dissect the very premise of the movie which makes as much sense as there being a bar in Saudi Arabia called 'The Shoplifter's Arms'. And let us not ponder the rationale of the first act that wants us to believe that a costly mining operation on the moon would be left in the capable hands of one fully dysfunctional and psychotic human clone with a operational lifespan of apparently 2 years but going on 4. People, it's time to call a spade a spade and this is just turd-fiction, aimed pointblank at the lowest common denominator. People who have never read a science-fiction book, have never watched a star trek episode and to whom 2001 is just a date on a grub-stained calendar still clipped to the fridge. Why is it nowadays, that unoriginality is uniformly praised, blatant theft of ideas is applauded, asinine plot points are gulped like morning coffee and vapidity is so readily mistaken for often the exact opposite?

920,Taxi Driver,Urban Anomi.,"A truly disturbing movie. Travis Bickle (Robert DeNiro), great name, falls into a mood of brooding, amorphous rage and is frustrated in his attempts to murder a politician. So he wipes out a couple of low-life pimps instead. The story tracks him through his descent into insanity. Interesting folks are encountered along the way but have less impact than rubber bumpers have on a pinball. Cybill Shepherd and Peter Boyle, for instance. Boyle is one of a handful of taxi drivers, like DeNiro, who gather at a certain café to shoot the breeze on breaks. He's particularly funny in his working-class disinclination to think things through. ""Them queers"" have to get married and divorced in California, he says wonderingly. I saw this in the Castro Theater in San Francisco and the audience erupted in laughter. When DeNiro asks for advice and gets nonsense in response, Boyle asks, ""What do you want, Bertrand Russell?"" The film is unusual for Martin Scorsese. His most successful work has been with solidary groups, like small time hoods and the Mafia, in which there is an agreed-upon set of rules, and everyone knows everyone else. This one digs into urban anomie. ""Anomi"" is a concept developed by the French sociologist Emile Durkheim and it means, essentially, ""without rules."" It's the kind of thing you experience when you drive into a vast strip mall parking lot and all the yellow lines guiding traffic have been erased. What do I do NOW, Ma? Scorsese is examining a social world that, as an Italian Catholic, he really has had little contact with. The film was written by Paul Schrader who, as an ex-Calvinist, is a little more familiar with this sort of ontological anxiety. It crops up in the production design. When DeNiro makes his unfulfilling meeting with Jody Foster, the twelve-year-old whore, it collapses in misunderstanding but in the background there are a multitude of Catholic candles. The climactic scene has a voice reading a letter to DeNiro from Foster's square Midwestern parents, congratulating him for an act that was ancillary to his own agenda, which was evidently to bring the world down around his ears. A film of the 1970s, it resonates less with audiences today. The racial troubles that were so headline-grabbing at the time show up less often in the news today. Not that the problem of race is solved, but the categorical thinking that divided us into two warring tribes has less relevance. The resentment simmers but has been cut off at the ankles, partly by our recent election of an African-American to the highest office in the nation. At the same time we have to admit that, as a nation, we are pustular with hatred for each other and for other countries that may not behave the way we want them to. Our leading presidential candidate has made it clear that he will go to war with Iran if Iran doesn't give up its nuclear ambitions. These attitudes come from the same place as Travis Bickle's. Most powerful shot in the movie: the camera slowly moves in on a bubbling glass of Alka Seltzer on the table in front of Robert DeNiro. All that fizzing is but one step removed from the explosion that is to follow.",8.0,rmax304823,2009/03/29,17,10
921,Detachment,Classy movie!,"I hope you do not detach yourself from my movie review of the drama ""Detachment"". But if you do, I punderstand I mean understand due to the numerous puns incorporated. ""Detachment"" stars Adrien Brody as Henry Barthes, a longtime substitute teacher who detaches himself from deep emotion due to a troubled past. Oh Henry! What could have happened? I will detach myself from revealing that because it does play a crucial factor in the film's narrative, and I do not want to spoil it for you. When he is transferred to another school, Henry's life begins to change due to the new people in his life. Henry befriends an attractive teacher colleague named Sarah Madison. A bullied female student named Meredith admires Henry due to his willingness to always help students in need. Henry also aids a young prostitute named Erica, and even allows her to stay in his place, with no sexual attachments required. Henry also constantly visits his ailing elderly grandfather. Henry is a good man. But when Meredith wants Henry to be a substitute of a father figure, and when Erica wants Henry to be a substitute of a lover figure, and when Grampa wants Henry to be a substitute of a savior figure, and when Ms. Madison falsely accuses Henry of being a substitute of a child molester figure, it puts Henry into a maximum stress level state. Director Tony Kaye, who also helmed ""American History X"", does more than an O Kaye job in presenting a story of a melancholy man trying to assist others while at the same time holding on to a dark past. Carl Lund's ""Detachment"" screenplay was a bit unorthodox but well-worded. Brody has not been this good in a starring role since his Oscar-winning turn in ""The Pianist"". Brody taught us a lesson that he can still act with his marvelous work as Henry! Yo Adrien, you did it! Christina Hendricks continues her rise to movie stardom with another well-rounded performance as Sarah Madison. Others in the supporting acting faculty that had passing grades included James Caan as veteran teacher Charles Seaboldt, Marcia Gay Harden as Principal Carol Dearden, Tim Blake Nelson as Mr. Wiatt, and Lucy Liu as Assistant Principal Dr. Doris Parker. Young actresses Sami Gayle who played Erica and Betty Kaye who played Meredith did show some promise with their performances, but still have to pass a few more tests to gain acting tenure.

Light travels 186,000 miles per second and yet it takes 100,000 years for a single beam of light to cross the entire Milky Way Galaxy. And our galaxy, to quote Carl Sagan, is only one among billions and billions. The vastness of space truly is stunning. But thanks to a ""worm hole"" the folks in Interstellar leave the Milky Way in a cosmic snap of the fingers. And yet, having just achieved this most amazing of all feats, our heroes are pretty much bored to tears. Instead, everybody is more concerned with some father/daughter relationship that wasn't developed in the first place. Look, if you're going to make a movie that purports to explore the fascinating mysteries of the universe, then do it! Have some wonderment in the story. Dazzle me not only with visuals, but with amazement at the astonishing scope of our universe. And why not produce a script that obeys the laws of astrophysics, or at least some theories thereof?

925,The Fault in Our Stars,I really can't see how this is 8+,"I'm giving this a 3 because I gave Boyhood a 2 and I think this movie deserves slightly better. I gave Boyhood a 2 because I come from China and I know what ""abysmal"" means and I wanted to separate Boyhood from those films that actually deserved absolute trash. But that's it. That's the only reason this film is getting the extra 2 points from me. Honestly I'm losing faith in IMDb and rotten tomatoes and all critics and the general audience. How do people give such high scores for such pretentious and empty films? I'm NOT one of the people who think that visually pleasing films are the best. However, I think people who would back any ""indie"" film and attack the ones disagreeing as shallow and ignorant are equally annoying. I don't think there's any superiority in genre. And concluding ""you must be one of those that love Transformers"" is a pretty weak arguing point. Anyway, rants aside, I think this movie is extremely childish and unrealistic. The story kinda parallels Twilight and 50 Shades, only it made the fantasy ride on a tragedy to seem more deep and mature. It really makes me wonder how much the authors of these books experienced in life to have came up such unrealistic crap. Terminal cancer patients don't behave or look like this. Oh gosh this is so disturbing to me... Couldn't they have picked somebody else for the actors? Cancer patients don't look this healthy. Gus was one that needed to lose a limb, but still had that healthy skin and beefy body, huh? Even the CGI for the prosthesis was so fake. I guess his shin was just too bulky to make it look like it was just a stick underneath the pants. Haley's character was really unlikable. The girl had more negativity and aloofness than Bella from Twilight, plus she liked to get all deep and talk about some philosophy that the pretentious teenagers love. I was totally wondering where Gus got all that stuff he talked about in his final love letter. How did you see this girl as all those good qualities anyway? I had minimal impression of her being smart or caring. Gus was unreal. The philosophy was incredibly naive and pretentious. His way of dealing with things were childish. The way people responded weren't much real either. I mean, you give THAT speech at a middle aged lady and she LETS you throw eggs at her car and house? And all that applauding when they kissed? I'm surprised they even let Haley continue climbing. And yeah, a virgin that's about to die has that much confidence in landing girls who don't even want to talk, huh? Also, even putting the character aside, the actor had very bad acting skills for a lead. This movie makes no sense. Was it written by a 15 year old? I can forgive someone that age for thinking this is good philosophy and realistic love and a good story. Oh wait the movie wasn't all naive and pretentious. The writer was a character with some dimensions, and the writer had a good point. But they made the writer such an asshole that it was impossible to redeem him or explain his reason in the end. In all, just a very naive and unrealistic movie with pretentious philosophies and childish fantasies.",3.0,cathey-127,2014/09/30,10,5
926,Intermission,As enjoyable as putting HP Sauce in your tea,"'Intermission' is one of those films that should have been huge and yet somehow never really achieved its true potential. Many people call it 'the Irish Trainspotting' and I can sort of see where they're coming from. However, it's not quite as bleak as Trainspotting, relying more on everyday folk and the relationship troubles they get into. Plus the odd armed robbery thrown in there for good measure. When I sat my girlfriend down and made her watch it, she said that it was good, but could have been better if it was a little more focused. I guess that's fair criticism. It is a little all over the place here and there. It relies on numerous characters and story lines, all coming together in the end. And, like any story with multiple characters, not all get the screen time they deserve to fully flesh them out. You have your stars like Cillian Murphy and Kelly MacDonald leading the way (and Colin Farrell is kind of there as a marketing ploy as he's featured heavily in the film's marketing, yet only really appears in the form of an extended cameo – not to say he isn't fun and evil all at the same time!). Intermission isn't a family film. Don't be fooled by the cover that makes it look like a rom-com. It's comedy as its blackest. All the humour is derived from 'adult' situations and there are plenty of scenes that you wouldn't want to watch with your mother. I think it's definitely an underrated little gem. Yes, it has a few flaws, but all its jokes seemed to hit their targets where I was concerned and I'll continue to sit everyone I know down and force them to watch it for many years to come.",9.0,bowmanblue,2016/11/03,0,0
927,October Sky,Launching into my Top 10 List for many reasons,"I like how the movie shows some of the (pun?) granularity to the coal business; clearly these men that worked down there were not a pack of mindnumbed dolts. Homer's father John (Chris Cooper) advances quite high in the company as a shift supervisor/foreman, and he loves his work. He's good at it. The film provides enough footage to educate us to a minimal level that working down here wasn't Hell, rather it's a job requiring hard bodies, tougher minds, and constant focus on what the flock one is doing.

928,The Wailing,Mind blowing example ...,"Of what horror movies should strive for! I had put off watching this one for a long while as it was just so long I knew I needed to have a good night to focus and really absorb it. Needless to say that wasn't hard at all. I was hooked within the first 5 mins and didn't look up from the screen until it ended. Between the excellent acting, the well constructed story, the steady flowing suspense and the breathtaking scenery there wasn't a minute that I was not completely enthralled in this story. I love horror movies, all kinds... Even some of the cheesy ones, but its always an exciting moment when I find one that is completely satisfying from start to finish. The only part I had a hard time with was when he killed the Cane Corso, but I'm a mega serious animal lover that has to admit I always have a harder time with the animals demise in horror movies than I do the people's. Even though I know its all fake lol. But that one hit in particular as that Corso looks like it could be my dogs twin... That aside, I absolutely loved the overall take away left after watching this movie and definitely recommend it to anyone that loves really good, well made horror movies.",9.0,Wikkid_Gamez,2019/06/18,11,5
929,Hotel Transylvania,Mondo monster fun!,"Somewhere within haunted woods lays the secret entrance leading under a foggy graveyard and over a lone stone bridge to Hotel Transylvania, perched on its secluded rocky island in the shadows of central Romania's Carpathian Mountains. Human-free since 1898, Dracula's (voiced by Adam Sandler) castle-like vacation destination offers sanctuary to monsters of all kinds seeking refuge and relaxation from the daily grind of damnation. A tireless staff of zombie redcaps, witchy maids and gargoyle waiters lurch at the ready to serve all guests. The hotel is also home to Dracula's daughter Mavis (Selena Gomez), whose upcoming 118th birthday means finally discovering the unknown world beyond her overprotective father's creature comfort inn - until lost young American backpacker Jonathan (Andy Samberg) wanders into the lobby. Wow. What an incredibly entertaining animated feature. Heavily softened and loosely modernized, the primary supporting characters Dracula, Frankenstein (Kevin James), Griffin the Invisible Man (David Spade), Wayne the Werewolf (Steve Buscemi), and Murray the Mummy (CeeLo Green) are delightfully based on some of the most famous Universal Studios monsters to ever haunt the silver screen. It's great seeing them lovingly depicted here for a younger and young-at-heart crowd of moviegoers. If you're so inclined, doing a quick search through Wikipedia brings up a wealth of history regarding each of these legendary creatures of the night, including which famed films were based on stage plays, literary treasures and ancient lore. And, before the ghoul patrol purists start foaming at the ears, yes Wayne isn't really a werewolf. We know he's more an anthropomorphised wolf night and day. Yes, Frankenstein has always ever been the name of the doctor not the monster in the true classics. Relax, it's a fun kids movie. Just roll with it, and enjoy the glib aside at the Twilight movies near the end. Peter Baynham and Robert Smigel's screenplay crackles with boundless energy and clever laughs throughout this 91-minute screening. It's sheer genius that these monsters are actually just as terrified of humans, fearful that we're getting fatter to overpower them and do nasty things such as cut open their heads to fill with candy. Hilarious. The story arc shift from it being about Dracula and his wonderfully motley hotel guest to it being about sheltered Mavis seeing the wider world through Jonathan's gregarious eyes is memorably rich and compelling. Also, keep an eye out for Wayne's daughter Winnie (voiced by Sandler's daughter Sadie), who uproariously steals her one scene opposite the big boys. Top marks also go to Ron Lukas and Noelle Triaureau for their outstanding art direction here. Hotel Transylvania is visually amazing. Amazing still, the official website is absolutely well worth checking out. Before clicking enter at its splash page, checking out the What guests have to say link takes you to a wonderfully imaginative listing on TripAdvisor. Notable highlights of the site itself are the paper toys of Mavis and Murray and the colouring pages of all the main characters available in the free downloads section. You'll also find slightly addictive games including Dracula's Maze, Wayne's Wolf Pup Wrangle, Suitcase Sort, and a What Monster Are You quiz.

930,Detachment,It's better than that,"This film, like Last Temptation of Christ, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, and Donnie Darko, is amongst a very few to have succeeded in isolating the nature and power of humanity when developed in people, like Henry Barthes, as well as the predicament that comes along with the attempt to act on it. This humanity which inspires us to be better people manifests as a rescue and redemption impulse which we can sum up as ""don't let people get stuck in a hole if you can help show them how to get out of it"" – which is a bit like the Golden Rule (""do unto others "" which we all know instinctively to be both right but also, more tragically, far from generally applied), the conjecture is that if you are human enough, like him, to know you are connected to others, albeit at arm's length, then to deserve your own self-respect (the only sort of respect that matters) you have to try to get a ladder to them. This is reason stumbling about in a world that can't see it for what it is, but rather only its bearer who is then put on a pedestal and trapped in the unwanted role of redeemer so that attempted escape can be accounted as treachery and denial of self. The victims do not go for the idea of the ladder being offered so as to climb up and think differently to get out of the hole; that would be true education of course: they grab the man instead and put him on the pedestal rather than his idea. The victims wish to place their burdens into his outstretched hands rather than trying to accept the solutions being proffered by them, thus burdening the potential educator with the role of saviour through bullying use of his own sense of decency against him, instead of releasing themselves by acting on what is actually being offered; which is an inch to them where they decide to go for a yard. This predicament shows that the instinct to help when acted upon can easily rebound because the desperation built up in the victims can blind them to the magical offer of self-redemption - real education - concerning their understanding of themselves and those around them. These outstretched hands of the caring person are trying to offer the victims the ladder to escape but that is not always recognised for what it is and the consequences can be dire because the failures of those outstretched hands are then pointed to by the cynic who gets to prove that trying to help losers is a waste of time, which is all he wants out of the situation; proof of the good sense of hauling the ladder up, because the Golden Rule fails: so the callous powers that are the root cause of the problem can get on instead with the dire work of damaging and unjust appropriations against general humanity with not only a clear conscience, but now as a virtuous act. This is the way that rule has always worked since ancient times so we are actually being shown the cause of the failure of our supposed democracy. Those outstretched hands should amount to the victim's chance to escape from a vicious imaginary trap made real by the inhumanity of others and the lack of any apparent understanding from the controllers of an all-pervasive and overpowering economic governing system as brilliantly illustrated by role of Mr Mathias. The missing step is in the igniting of the necessary self-belief and understanding which would enable the ladder to be accepted at arms-length rather than the impulse of rushing to clutch at the ladder-bearer being yielded to. There are those, understandably and obviously, who can't stop themselves from grabbing at and getting their hooks into what they see as a highly necessary saviour who is interpreted as having shown personal love to them anyway rather than humanity; interpreted as the making of some kind of pass, and towards whom they only have to give devotion to secure obligation, accepting the pass: thus missing the point and wrecking the deeply felt mission of Barthes towards people in general. That would be the hope of spreading education too would it not? It is a remarkable film about education and its true power and meaning and the whole engagement that it can entail. This is so important that it should be taught by educators everywhere because it is what we are like, and why we are not succeeding as we should be in this truer mission. We just bore people and train them in ways that confuse and fail to connect with or ignite their imaginations or any other part of their finer minds. That's a kind of incarceration not release. Oh yes. It's a quite fantastic film. Pete Rogers",10.0,peterogers2,2013/10/19,6,4
931,Horrible Bosses 2,"""The right answer is because you are all morons!""","The chemistry between the main trio is what kept the first film together. It was the reason it was so successful, because of how visible the camaraderie is. The constant banter, Day's squeaky hamster voice and those sociopaths and psychopaths disguised as their bosses were the first film's big draws. This time around Nick, Kurt & Dale become entrepreneurs, start their own business with this shower head device called ""Shower Buddy"" and they are looking for a distributor. In comes Bert Hanson, who offers them a deal and in the end robs them of their company and the ownership of the ""Shower Buddy"" concept. Our three regular Joes are looking for a revenge and a way how to save the company. First time murder didn't work so let's try something else, right? The most noticeable difference about this sequel is the different approach to the humour.What I loved about the first film was the how much present was the black humour, which was a unusual for such a commercial comedy. The balance of the characters have changed instead of dealing with just one idiot in the group, Bateman's Nick now has to deal with two. Sudeikis's Kurt has changed from a sex-obsessed playboy into a sex-obsessed idiot. Nick now knows how to cope with his friends' moronity in order to not get upset. But still the banter between these morons is what makes the first film a great film, only this time they sometimes operate on borderline idiocy where you have to suspend your belief a bit. Revisiting the titular characters from the first film is a great but unnecessary activity - Kevin Spacey nails it once again and he is there for just a cameo, which is the exact time needed. Main problem for me was Aniston's Julia Harris. Her character is shoehorned into the story and creates an unnecessary obstacle for the main trio. Plus she forces Nick into telling one inappropriate story, not offensive, though. There is nothing offensive here. It just feels weird and out of place. Christoph Waltz who has showcased his incredible comedic talent numerous times is severely underused. He pops in for two or three scenes and doesn't really have any lines. Chris Pine, though comes off as a great comedic psychopath, he is that something fresh that every sequel needs. Although if you want to see him in a truly crazy, borderline psychopathic, devilish role then I recommend this year's Strech. Jamie Foxx returns as Motherf-cker Jones, although again unnecessary, his interactions with the main trio are still one of the funniest scenes in the film. Plus his role is quite significant in the third act. The car chase they get involved in has one gag which reminded me of the classic Simpsons humour. This time it is more visible that most of the film is improvised, when not all the jokes come off as funny. But the scripted ones (the imagined pick-up of ransom vs. what goes down afterwards, the car chase and plenty more) hit you hard and you end up laughing in your seat. A bit of a step down from the first (for me a classic) film but still a great a sequel which serves you a great time at the cinema.",8.0,jan_kalina,2014/11/28,24,13
932,Interstellar,One of the best Sci-Fi movie at the moment,"Expect very much from the cast and director. And all expectations fulfilled. The film is almost 3 hours, but they are not feeling. Time flies by. No slack in the story-line. Everywhere where there might be desired drool, snot or lengthy disquisitions - all collected in a couple of phrases and capacious video sequences. Nor any stupid nonsense about the Bible and God. It's Sci-Fi, baby! After viewing the impression left is not even like the movie, and how soundly from the book that you read with pleasure. Lots of thoughts left to think. The film, like a good book revealed to you something new, along with the author allowed to dive into his world. World, so close to ours. Very suggest targeting the film for viewing. Even if you do not like everything in the movie, you will get acquainted with one of the best representatives of the genre on today date.",10.0,obrazcoff,2014/11/13,71,40
933,Goodfellas,The Truth About The Mob,"Martin Scorsese explores the life of organized crime with his gritty, kinetic adaptation of Nicolas Pileggi's best-selling Wiseguy in Goodfellas.It stars Robert De Niro,Joe Pesci and Ray Liotta. This is a true-life account of mobster and FBI informant Henry Hill,who happens to be a small time gangster that takes part in a robbery with Jimmy Conway and Tommy De Vito.His two partners kill off everyone else involved in the robbery, and slowly start to climb up through the hierarchy of the Mob. Henry, however, is badly affected by his partners success and decided to bring about the downfall of his mob partners. Goodfellas has one great achievement about organized crime and the mob.It portrays the benefits of being part of the mob and at the same time puts guilt upon them and never glamorizes them one bit.Also,it narrates man's constant lust for power and greed.Overall,this is one great crime classic.",10.0,Desertman84,2011/10/26,10,6
934,Moon,"Like the Moon itself - big, pretty and largely lifeless.","Moon opens with an advertorial that informs us that the moon has been identified as a huge source of energy for Earth, and that ""friendly"" big corporations are doing their best to provide us with reliable pure energy. It seems one of these energy production centres on the far side of the moon is staffed by a lone maintenance guy named Sam Bell, who is at the tail end of a three year contract. His only companionship is a computer called Gerty who is sorta like the mechanical arms from Iron Man, only he has Kevin Spacey's voice. As Sam is all by his lonesome, he fills his time with hobbies, exercising, TV, tending to his garden and waiting for dispatches from employers and his family on Earth, which are delayed as the far side of the moon gets no live signals due to inaccessibility. His only action is when one of the many ""harvesting"" machines is experiencing malfunctions or needs maintenance. On one of these call outs things don't go according to plan, and Sam wakes up afterwards in an infirmary. And this is where sh*t goes pear-shaped. I'm not sure how SPOILER free people want their movies these days but as some key info is about to be outlined. WARNING! HERE BE POSSIBLE SPOILERS!! Sam is quarantined on base by Gerty, but he gets a bit toey and manages to con his way out with a plausible excuse, at which time he goes to investigate the crash site. The evidence from the accident is all around, and indeed there is still someone in the vehicle that requires urgent medical attention. It is Sam. The remainder of the film revolves around the obvious questions and dilemmas that would arise when one unexpectedly co-habits with an exact replica of themselves.  - Who is the clone?  - Why is there a clone?  - What is real, and what is imagined, (or implanted)?  - Who has caused all of this and why? So Sam(s) ultimately team up to work out just what the hell is going on, and what is really behind this perceived deception. They search high and low, on base and off for clues and evidence, which of course lead to conflict and disagreement between the Sams, and to them putting in place a daring plan I got bored. I didn't care which Sam was real, which wasn't and why. The first plodding hour put paid to that. Other reviews have lauded the technical skills shown in having multiple Sam Rockwells on screen at once, and that is honestly impressive. Also impressive is the on-moon shots that look especially realistic and cool, but the action (if you might call it that, I wouldn't) is so slow that when the plot does advance rapidly near the end I was already out of patience. I have consulted the IMDb boards to make sure I ""got it"" when the movie wrapped up, and I am pretty sure I had most of it right before I went to the internet cheat sheet. That revelation alone was disappointing, as the fact that I did understand what happened and still wasn't blown away was annoying, as I waited 90+ minutes to get to that point. I'll leave it to the individual to decide if the ending gives merit to what came before, and I hope others get more from this film than I did. Ultimately this was a fine acting performance by Sam Rockwell wasted on a lightweight twist that seemed to be only a mild surprise when it finally arrived. Final Rating – 6.5 / 10. I think I am pussing out on this, I want to give a lower score but can't help but feel there must be more than I saw. I won't spend another 100 minutes of my time investigating this though.

935,Interstellar,"Hands down, mind-blowing","This film is just legendary, I do not see why people are hating this film, its unpredictable and well just plain brilliant. A lot of the science in this movie is true (for a science fiction film). I believe this is Nolan's best yet and I believe that its probably the greatest film ever made. Matthew deserves an Oscar for his role (no joke) and Hans Zimmer's soundtrack is a masterpiece in it's own right (completely new and different from his previous work, check the dark knight trilogy and inception). The FX are brilliant and their are no complaints from me. The acting is just great and it really asks questions on who we are and our purpose.

936,Ferris Bueller's Day Off,Maybe I missed something,"But this film never struck me as funny, witty, inspiring or just simply irreverent. The smug smirky Ferris seems to have the entire world and all the adults that populate it figured out, really at 17 I'd like to think I did to, but reality said different. His attitude toward life is to get the most out of it, an admirable quality except that his methodology to achieve his end involves shameless manipulation of his friend Cameron and of course Cameron's father Ferrari California Spider, which he just has to have for his day off, reasoning that if Cameron's dad hadn't wanted the car taken he should have locked it in the garage. The logic here is that I'm not responsible for taking the car your irresponsible for not locking it up, therefore I'm blameless. OK never mind that this car sells for about 2 to 3 million dollars on the auction market when they ever come up, the fact that it gets wrecked at the end of movie is just a crime. Of course there's Ferris, once the deed is done shifting the blame and onus onto his friend for what happened. Is as if to say ""Ok I had my fun, now you take the consequences"" Maybe I love cars too much or was just imbued with a stronger moral code as kid, but I find the whole smarmy Ferris a bit much to take, friends are merely there for his pleasure and the minute that pleasure is done so are they. Look down at the Ferrari for proof of that.",,barrieca,2007/01/18,8,4
937,Pulp Fiction,"Fun cult film, tad overrated","Conflicted on this one. I like a lot of elements of it, the characters are (mostly) really compelling and interesting. I think some of the ""Segments"" are a lot stronger than others. I think that the first part of Bruce Willis's story is just... bland. I didn't find it very interesting or compelling. It gets interesting though. The first and last are by far my favourite, but for the most part it's pretty strong. I do think this film is slightly overrated. That's not to say that it isn't good, but I think a lot of people think it is a whole lot better then it is. The film is acted well and I enjoyed all the action, not to mention the comedy in this film caught me by surprise. I found it really hilarious. I see why everyone had/has a crush on Uma Thurman now, she really is deserving of the main character on the cover. I also remembered how much I like long shots. I think they allow exposition to be delivered in a way that is more pleasing to the audience. Overall, good crime flick with some great comedy and action but a tad overrated. 7-8/10.",8.0,TheHoodOfSwords,2020/04/21,22,16
938,Goodfellas,A great insight into mafia life.,"I recently watched Goodfellas. This movie unlike The Godfather which shows the viewers and critics what mafia life is like higher up the ranks of mafia life. Goodfellas tells the viewers and critics what mafia life is like lower down the mafia food chain. Goodfellas also gives the knowledge that murder and other serious crimes in mafia life happens a lot of the time. When Billy Batts is murdered by a rage of fury from Tommy De Vito (Joe Pesci); and when Paulie (Paul Sorvino) asks Henry Hill (Ray Liotta)did he know what happened to Billy Batts. And Henry replies with numerous incidents. The power expressed in the this movie is an outstanding feature of the brilliance of a Martin Scorsese's directing. Example: When an innocent young man called ""Spider"" is killed by Tommy. Another feature of which I noticed of Martin Scorsese's directing is that he can place the middle of the movie. This skill is also shown in Casino. Not many directors can do that, but Scosese does it perfectly in both Casino and Goodfellas. A sad part of mafia life is shown in Goodfellas, this is the fact that children such as : Henry Hill, Tommy and Jimmy ; when they are young can join the mafia. This movie is basically a biography of Henry Hill that an innocent young school boy is falling deeper into mafia life. He ended up doing a prison sentence for his love of mafia life. Even at the end court scene he still loved the mafia life even thought he nearly got killed for it. Even to this generation of movies getting greedier of special effects. The modern generation can appreciate film such as Goodfellas.",9.0,markocricket-1,2008/03/15,7,4
939,The Chorus,Wonderful and very watchable film about a teacher attempting to bring his own ideas and methods to a worn out establishment.,"From France comes a Christophe Barratier film named Les Choristes; or 'The Choir' as well as 'The Chorus' as it has been transcribed for British and American audiences, it would seem. The film is an uplifting tale, a realistic look at several pretty desperate situations for all parties involved, in a French boarding school a few years after The Second World War. The film looks at the struggles in life for several people of varying ages and roles, be they headmaster attempting to run the school; a male teacher whom arrives and is thus unacquainted and initially nervous before he attempts to bring his own ideas to the curriculum as well as several children themselves, all of whom are varying in their temperament and attitudes The Choir manages to spread its focus around these parties but uses the character of Clément Mathieu (Jugnot) as a central focus or viewpoint as the events and world around him unfolds. The film is, theoretically, one long flashback induced by an elderly man in the present day named Pépinot who went to said school with Pierre Morhange, someone who has since become a conductor of quite some considerable note. The story is unfolded through Mathieu's journal, something Pépinot has come into possession with. It would seem a lot of people complain about the giving away of Morhange being this world famous conductor, quite literally, in the very first few minutes. The idea is, following on from where Mathieu brings musical classes to everyone at the school's attention, we know that he must've done enough to inspire a very young boy to go on and become the conductor he is. I don't think it acts as too much of a bad thing and I think that, once the entering of the man's journal and the flashback proceeds, a different lead has taken the mantle and the film is, essentially, more of a study of one man and his quest to get this choir class set up and how he will overcome diversity as well as the problems he encounters. I will point at Carlito's Way (or most any other neo-noir in which the anti-hero should or would usually 'get' his comeuppance for living the life he did) which shows the lead of that film shot at point blank range in the first thirty seconds or so. What follows is a flashback; a tale about the tribulations and actual journey of how one gets to that point. On this basis, The Choir worked for me. I found Mathieu's story riveting and never overly sentimental or melodramatic as he just tried to inspire, educate and generally do what he wanted to do in the hope others may find it equally as fascinating and/or enjoyable. I am not a teacher myself but is this not what every teacher of any subject at any level just generally tries to do? When Mathieu initially arrives, the film balances its tone of light comedy and effective drama while establishing the sort of character Mathieu is and what lies ahead. There is a scene where a child is guilty of whatever offence and since no one knows who did it, Mathieu must pick a boy at random to be punished as he does not know any of them. He is reluctant but must go through with the situation; regretful when he sees the seemingly harmless boy he's selected for punishment and later apologetic. The school means business, the children can sometimes step out of line but Mathieu will not be moved or change his ways for either. Initially, the children are something to fear. Their shouts and running echoes eerily through the corridors and the nasty results of a practical joke still remain on one member of staff thus preparing our lead for what awaits him but little do any of them know at the time of what changes will occur once initial contact is made. As a character, Mathieu is in a natural position of control as a teacher over the children but is more understanding as a super-egotistical element of the school, offering to introduce his own classes complete with content against the wishes of other staff. He himself answers to the headmaster named Rachin (Berléand), an individual who believes, and consequently has everyone else believe, that 'action, reaction' is the best form of education; a sort of 'solve violence with violence' ideation so that if they step out of line, you give them a good smack and hope they don't do it again. But what Mathieu sees is that they need something to exercise their minds; a common interest he can perhaps implant within them that brings them all together and, somehow, enables everyone to just have something in common with everyone else  that thing is singing. It breeds a common ground between teacher and pupil, something everyone can do in tandem and at once. Despite some snotty reactions, The Choir is worth the time for anyone searching out an engaging film that looks at triumph over incorrect beliefs as an individual tries to bring their own ideas to the plate and construct interests set at a time in which the very nation of France was in a state of disorientation and rebuilding themselves.",8.0,johnnyboyz,2009/03/12,0,0
940,Interstellar,"A familiar journey to the unknown, albeit a grand one","So last night I got the chance to see the early screening of Christopher Nolan's Interstellar. The film I've been waiting so much from the early days of the shooting. How did it fare? Here's my take: To avoid any tl;dr risk, let me get this straight from the very beginning, Interstellar is one goddamnedly good film, it gets you to the edge of your seat, it soars, it warps, it rips your brain senseless. It's that good. Interstellar is a story about the earth dying, with its soil no longer able to sustain crops other than corn, and of course, it will lead to the extinction of humanity. Our hero is an ex-NASA test pilot named Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a typical ordinary-guy-in-an-extraordinary- situation everyman who's also a dedicated family man, especially toward his daughter Murphy (named after the Murphy's Law). In an all-too-Armageddon style our hero gets invited by the (publicly) defunct NASA to become humanity's last hope in finding a new home, for they have found a wormhole near Saturn (2001, anyone?) which will warp the astronauts to another galaxy in quest of a habitable planet. Solid and compact premise, although it's been used before. For seasoned filmgoers, there are many similar elements (although it's understandable) with Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and Robert Zemeckis' Contact (1997). In a sense that this is not a bang-bang-shoot-shoot-blow-em-up sci-fi, but more of a slow-burning, metaphysical sci-fi which gets you to think about your place in the universe and your exact place in time. Similarity with 2001 and Contact is never a bad thing, but it becomes a wee bit too predictable, although Nolan is a smart enough director in providing the final (a very sentimental one, I should say) twist in the story. The visuals in this film is majestic, everything is shot to a meticulously calculated level, Nolan-style. The space scenes are serenely suspenseful just like Cuaron's Gravity, but unlike the documentary feel of Gravity, there's a real gusto and pace to these scenes. You should also be prepared for the (for some, maybe) unexpected third act, it is Nolan's most sentimental and humane moment to date. And this is why Interstellar is more than just a science-fiction, it is a human drama intertwined in space and time loop. One thing that Nolan gets a bit wrong is the narrative. Nolan was never a 'warm' director, his films are filled with brilliant ideas and flair but it feels cold, it maybe suits Memento and The Dark Knight but in Interstellar he seems to have been lost in determining which of the interpersonal drama or the sci-fi that will be Interstellar's forte. The result is a rather incongruous script, intermittently cutting off the excitement of the previous scene and so on. But it is a forgivable sin, for the good is a lot more than the bad in this monumental film. At the end of the day, all I can say is that Interstellar is a grand film. It is monolithic, thoughtful, sentimental, sophisticated, visceral but also with its flaws. I wouldn't say it's Nolan's best work to date, but I daresay that this is one of the best science fiction ever released. After watching Interstellar, do yourself a favor and get lost in space and time and go back in time to see Contact (1997) and 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) to further wonder and wander into the realms of the unknown. Because sometimes it is the unknown that fascinates us, frightens us and brings out the best in us.",9.0,aldamayo,2014/11/04,1093,665
941,Hotel Transylvania,"This movie is about a teenage boy who stumbles upon a hotel run by an over-protective father version of Dracula who wants to protect his daughter, Mavis.","The movie starts out looking like a sweet movie about a vampire father and daughter growing up together. Well, don't let that mislead you. After the first two minutes of the movie, we go from 1895 to present day. It shows Dracula planning for his daughter Mavis's 118th birthday. He has invited all his monster friends to come stay at the hotel and prepare for Mavis's birthday extravaganza. This scene is utter chaos, and just looked like ""bad animated movie"" to me. I mean, when the movie includes the vocal talents of Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Ceelo Green, and Selena Gomez, I didn't have very high expectations. But instead of being a cute animated movie, it turned out to be 90 minutes worth of a random spew of events.

942,Interstellar,A Visually Monumental And Thoughtful Sci-Fi Epic,"I was extremely lucky to get the chance to see this film upon its first day release, before entering the cinema, my expectations were already high, after all, this was a film from the cinematic genius who brought us the likes of 'Inception' and 'The Dark Knight', to summarise the following review in a single sentence: I left the cinema in extreme awe from the visual masterpiece I had just viewed. A film that explores the psychological and emotional state of a man whose life revolves around his family, 'Interstellar' is a thrilling and thought-provoking film that boasts an intellectual story masterfully written by the Nolan brothers. Whilst there seems to have been influence from films like '2001: A Space Odyssey' and 'Apollo 13', 'Interstellar' is unique in its own way. Whilst the subject may be hard to comprehend at times, it can't be denied how visually monumental and thoughtful Christopher Nolan's epic science fiction masterpiece is, and can easily be named the best film of this year and possibly one of the greatest science fiction films to have ever graced the screen. A sheer brilliant feat of cinema.",,CalRhys,2014/11/08,1990,1363
943,Taxi Driver,"This Emperor has an obvious ""wardrobe malfunction.""","So many have told us this is a great movie, if not one of the greatest. Why? At the beginning, we are introduced to a man, Travis Bickle. who is behaving in a kind of infantile way. We have no idea why. Is he new to the city? All we really ever learn is that he was in the Marines, honorably discharged, and he thinks New York City is filthy, disgusting, etc. Why? The cinematography actually makes the city look vibrant and dynamic. I was there, at the time, though not quite an adult yet, and never got the sense that it was a filthy, disgusting place, despite my parents' somewhat paranoid attitudes. Granted, I did not travel all over Manhattan, as a taxi driver might, but that just compels the viewer to ask why he is in New York in the first place, let alone driving a taxi there! When Iris talks about going to a commune in Vermont, he says that it's not the kind of place for him. What is? Yes, we understand he is ""disturbed,"" but we are given no clue as to why, which creates a frustrating quality to this film. We get quite a bit of cozy music (which sometimes goes ""dark"") with the wonderful cinematography, and in general the city appears quite interesting, and not especially dangerous. Why weren't there several scenes of violent crime? Was prostitution only occurring in Manhattan at that time? There is a kind of self-contradictory quality to this film that irritates, and there is not even an attempt to resolve it. A glaring example of this is the long scene with Iris and her pimp; what are we meant to infer from it? It almost seems like Scorsese wants us to think that the ""bad"" New Yorkers aren't really that bad. If so, it contradicts the apparent point of the film. If not, why was it not cut out of the film? We do see some characters that represent the more ""positive"" side of New York, including the politician, Charles Palantine, and one of his campaign workers, Betsy. Does New York appear to them the way it does to Travis? For the most part, if they are concerned with someone who might do them harm, it is Travis, not the people he regards as ""scum."" This is where the movie could have gone, and it would have been consistent with society, especially the ""white flight"" of that era. We would see that less educated, more ""ethnic,"" ""white"" people had become nearly paranoid with stories about fictions, such as the ""black snipers of Newark,"" for example. We could then see the politician character fanning the flames of such fear, perhaps prompting Travis to do something violent. We could get flashbacks and find out that Travis sees Palantine as a surrogate father. Those kinds of scenes could provide some grounding (social and psychological) to this film. It would be a shocking twist for us to think that Palantine is taking Travis under his wing, only to find out that he is trying to use Travis to further his political ambitions, and at that point, with the cozy music turning ""dark,"" an actual drama might just arise ! I like the idea of the world as seen through the eyes of a troubled man, so I don't object to this approach, but the audience needs some idea of why that person is the way he is (and you can't put in scenes that don't include that character, such as the one with Iris and her pimp). As it stands, this is a confused film. It's like the cinematographer went ahead and made his film while the director was making a contrary one. The soundtrack seems like an attempt to bring the two together, but it doesn't work because we haven't been shown enough contrast between ""good"" and ""bad"" New York, and too much is seen from the perspective of a character who seems seriously disturbed and clearly paranoid, for some unknown reason. And astute viewer might assume that it may be about racial strife, if we consider the recent history, circa the mid 1970s. Perhaps Scorsese just took that for granted, but there are ways of making your ideas known with subtlety, and Scorsese was unwilling or unable to do that here, for whatever reason. I think of an unfinished Old Master portrait when I think of this film, only with the background finished rather than the head !",3.0,nazztrader,2012/02/02,39,19
944,Spider-Man 2,"Sequel, Shmequel. This one tops the first in every area.","Sequels. Who needs them? Who wants them? I hate them, most of the time. Most of the time, the sequel ruins what made the first one so great. Take the Superman movies. First one, GREAT! After that, it was all down hill. Batman is another perfect example. The change in actors playing Batman/Bruce Wayne, along with the slide into fantasy instead of realism ruined the Dark Realism of the first two. Along comes Spiderman. It had a top notch story, top notch actors, and top notch plot. Although the Green Goblin costume looked too much like a kid's Halloween costume and Willem Dafoe's dialogue was a bit over the top. Okay, that's an understatement, it was way over the top. The visuals of the first were mediocre at best, to the point where you could tell what was real and fake. Still, I wondered, how could they top it? It was still superb for a comic movie. Then I see the teaser for Spiderman 2....Made me feel all tingly inside. Then the trailer. I must say, I was salivating at the mouth. Then it came. I couldn't get any better than the midnight showing of the premiere! On the Edge of my seat before the movie even began. I know, I know. I am such a dork. The intro was great. I loved the Alex Ross drawings portraying some of the important plot points of the first movie, to remind us of how Spiderman came to be. From beginning to end, this movie had me laughing, crying, cheering, and just about any other emotion you could think of. The story was amazing. For those of you who think it was a rehash of the first stories theme, yes it was, and no it wasn't. First of all, yes it was about great responsibility coming with great power, but it is also so much more. It's about being able to balance his responsibility with his life. To borrow a Christian theme, it's about serving two masters. Either God or Money, and the struggle to decide which of the two to serve. Of course, the best part of the movie is in it's heart. The action is great, but it's the vulnerable parts that really shine, like the scene where Peter reveals a secret long kept hidden to Aunt May. The writers were so much more confident in their abilities when it came to the script dialogue, and except for one instance, everything flows perfectly. The only part that feels forced into the movie is Aunt May's speech about Heroes. The acting was so much better this time around too. You really feel the struggle going on inside of Peter Parker/Tobey Maguire, and I still can't think of anybody who could play the part better. He really makes you see the struggle, the pain going on inside, and he's more sure of his ability as an actor. Kristen Dunst plays the beautiful Mary Jane like no other, still making us love her even more, and ends the movie perfectly with one statement. You can't find a better Doc Ock either. Alfred Molina really brought substance to the part, and since their is no mask to hide behind, you can see the struggle between good and evil within his face. Though, a couple of the bits of dialogue were a bit overacted. The visuals are ten times better than those in the first. Doc Ock's arms move so realistically that you'd never believe they were real puppets and not CG. Spiderman looks even more realistic than ever. His motion is so much more fluid than the in the first movie and he doesn't look all rubbery. Sam Raimi, I tip my hat off to you for perfecting Spiderman. I had my worries about you when the first one hit, but you've got my confidence that you can do it, and do it right. I have only one question for you. How can you top this one? This movie is one of those movies that everybody can enjoy and for those who don't agree with me, here's webbing in your face.",10.0,jlpurvis2001,2004/08/15,4,4
945,Pulp Fiction,"Different,but it does not make it great","Sometimes after seeing a lot of good movies people want to watch something undefined and different,but it does not necessarily mean that the movie is good.When the theme song is the best part of the movie you surely can understand the quality.Sometimes ranking and charts do not show the real picture,this movie does not have a good story,a good screenplay or good dialogues but still it is in the top 10.But believe me this movie can neither give you entertainment nor any sense of understanding.Yeah i agree the movie is not boring,but it is not enjoyable either.Movies like shawshank redemption,godfather or lord of the rings,all of them has a magic-feature.Sometimes it is screenplay(Shawshank redemption) sometimes its dialogue(Godfather) sometimes it is the story (The lord of the rings) .But all of them had the important feature called continuity.I think it is a very important quality of a movie to keep it's continuity.This movie is divided into four parts which actually made the movie look like a comedy-puppet dance just with humans(Because the parts do not define one-another). The most embarrassing thing about this movie is after watching it you will think who is the fool yourself or the writer and directer.Yes this movie is different but not always Difference make something great at least in motion pictures at least.Whatever this is a must see movie for all because you can differentiate the better movies after watching it.",1.0,nibir201199,2012/02/17,265,107
946,The Wailing,"A movie that almost makes sense, but not quite, and this may be the whole point","Some movies have a coherent plot that is told in a non-straightforward fashion, or that is open to several interpretations, or that leaves out some parts requiring the audience to fill-in (e.g. an open end), and possibly this filling-in can be done in more than one way. These movies require several viewings and considerable thought to make sense. After watching The Wailing for the first time, I had the impression that it was this kind of movie. However, after watching it again, pondering it, and then reading and watching attempts by various people to interpret/explain it, I have come to a different conclusion. Namely, this movie does not have a coherent underlying plot. No matter how you shift the pieces of the puzzle in an attempt to recreate a coherent narrative, some pieces will never fit together, and not due to your incompetence, but because the underlying story is - possibly intentionally, possibly not - fundamentally inconsistent. It's like one of those optical illusions or Escher drawings that appear to describe a physical object, but in fact don't make physical sense. Accordingly, whether one enjoys this movie or not boils down to whether one can be content with a movie that is technically well-made (cinematography, acting, costumes, etc.), but (a) its plot makes no sense, and (b) it is told in a deceptive way as to lure you into thinking that the plot would make sense if only you gave the matter sufficient thought, thus leaving you with a lingering, irritating feeling of dissatisfaction and confusion. And maybe this is precisely the point of the movie: rather than telling a story, its purpose is to instill in the audience a feeling of confusion in the face of a sequence of events that almost, but not quite, makes sense. Much like life at times, no?",,oddeveneven,2017/01/10,138,114
947,Hotel Transylvania,"A monster-sized movie about, what else, MONSTERS!","Hotel Transylvania is a very zany combination of classic horror-movie monsters, ancient paranoia combined with modern terminology, fast-paced comedy, and even a strange teenage romance between two ""teenagers"" (one is really 118). So where to begin... The biggest positive is that Adam Sandler finally found a role befitting his voice. He voices Dracula, the iconic vampire of old, who in this movie is a very controlling yet caring father of Mavis (portrayed by Selena Gomez), and is also the creator and manager of Hotel Transylvania, a safe haven for monsters where they can relax and take a vacation. Here we see other iconic monsters such as Frankenstein (and his wife), The Wolfman (with his wife and kids), The Mummy, the Flyman, Quasimodo, and even the Invisible Man. Each of these monsters voices fit so well with their roles, such as Frankenstein played by Kevin James, ""Wayne"" the Wolfman by Steve Buscemi, Ceelo Green as ""Murray"" the Mummy, and even Chris Parnell as the Flyman. Oh, I could go on about the monsters, they're all cleverly portrayed, even if some of them are a bit stereotypical (Fran Drescher as ""Eunice"", or Bride of Frankenstein, while it is hilarious, does get on your nerves the more you hear it...). Even Selena Gomez does a very decent job as being Mavis, this ""teenage"" vampire who (not a big shocker) wants to see the world, yet her father, once again being controlling, scares her to come back to her father's loving arms in the sanctuary of his Hotel. Then enter Jonathan... Jonathan, as played by Andy Samberg, seems more like a typical teenage idiot who is too dumb to be afraid until it is too late; in fact, that's how he got to the castle in the first place! He arrives at the castle after a few townspeople tell him not to go, and his reaction is to simply take a picture with his phone? Who reacts like that when someone tells you your life is in danger? To continue, he later realizes that he has to blend in as a fellow monster, claiming to be a relative of Frankenstein, and has to show Mavis, and eventually Dracula, what they have been missing all their lives...a modern twist to their classical hotel. Jonathan to me seems to be the bigger blemish to an otherwise great film; his character seems to be nothing but the clueless idiot who just stumbles upon the Hotel, yet the other monsters take him seriously enough to consider his opinions? It eventually turns out to be a liar- revealed story where he's revealed NOT TO BE A MONSTER. And so he actually owns up to his lie and decides to head home. Dracula chases after him with his wild band of monsters in tow, and that's when even more humans show up in town at the local festival celebrating these classic monsters. These people seem to fall not too far from the Johnny Tree, as they simply accept them and want to help Dracula reach Jonathan and his plane (which leads to a Twilight Parody that had me laughing out of my seat). Finally, Jonathan and Mavis end up on a beach in Hawaii enjoying a different sort of vacation than Hotel Transylvania. So where are the positives? Again, the casting. A lot of these roles are very well portrayed, even Jonathan. Along with that the humor is great, there are plenty of things that will make both kids and adults laugh. The character development is sensitive too, if not a bit predictable (again the liar-revealed story, but with a twist where there's TWO liars this time). And finally, I have to say the animation is near flawless. Sony Picture Studios did a fantastic job animating this, especially the monsters, they look great! And of course Genndy Tartakovsky (creator of notable Cartoon Network's Dexter's Laboratory, Powerpuff Girls, Samurai Jack, and Symbiotic Titan) is just a gigantic asset to the film. The negatives? It's mostly a fault on the humans, as most if not all of them (especially the ""protagonist"" Jonathan) just don't add much other than to be the thing to hate, directly or indirectly. Thankfully, the only human you see for the majority of the film is just one human in contrast to loads of monsters. Also, the concept of the ""zing"" between Jonathan and Mavis needed a desperate rename (especially since Adam Sandler raps about it, which is something that broke my ears). It's touched on a lot in the film (such as ""You only zing once in your life""), yet couldn't they just call it a connection and get it over with? Do they really have to tone it down for little kids who can't even comprehend past 2 syllables? And finally, it may just be me, but I felt the pacing was very rushed in the whole film, especially when it came to Dracula. I understand that he's a control freak, and that he has to be quick on his feet in case something happens in his hotel, so it almost works for him. But in one scene where he's flying down hallways to catch up to Jonathan (who gets kidnapped for about the 3rd time, big surprise), he nearly runs through her daughter as if he were a train. I could hardly keep up with him! But again, it was something that was bothering me and I felt that it was way too quick. Altogether, this movie was a smart, well thought-out product that proves that once you know where you're meant to be, flaunt it! I felt this was one of Adam Sandler's better roles, and it just feels that he loved every moment of it. It's worth the watch, especially around Halloween time, pick it up when you get the chance!",7.0,RageReviewer,2014/04/21,4,3

949,Hotel Transylvania,"A Traditional Father/Daughter Story, Only Their Vampires!","Every father of a daughter has wished at some point in his life to keep his little girl well protected from the world and the wrong guys in a remote castle in the middle of nowhere for 118 years. ""Hotel Transylvania"" is an animated feature about a father, who happens to be Dracula, voiced by Adam Sandler, who does exactly that to his daughter Mavis, voiced by Selena Gomez. The story begins in the year 1895 where Dracula is unexpectedly forced to be a single father and raise his baby girl Mavis after a tragedy takes his wife's life. He builds a huge castle for Mavis and turns it into a hotel for monsters. His intentions is to make it a refuge for monsters (insects included) where no humans are allowed. Flash forward to the current year, it is the eve of Mavis 118th birthday. It seems to be the equivalent to a human teenager's 18th birthday. Mavis quickly reminds Dracula that his promise to her on her 118th birthday is that she would get to finally explore the world outside of the castle and even travel to a different country. Not wanting to disappoint his little girl, he allows her to visit a small village just outside of the castle that same night. However, it turns out that the village is not real. It is made of multiple facades with Dracula's zombie workers disguised as humans who scare Mavis away by using fire and threatening to kill her. Her curiosity of humans is put to rest by the experience. But, when she meets a mystery young male drifter named Jonathan who stumbles into the hotel claiming the identity of a party planner for her birthday who is Frankenstein's cousin – John Stein, Mavis feels a certain ""zing"" with him that she just can't shake. At the end, his true identity is revealed in the worst way – under the scrutiny of the hotel's monster guests as well as Mavis who is hurt by her Father's betrayal but is fascinated even more by Jonathan. However, upon Dracula's wishes Jonathan exits the hotel to continue his travels. Dracula says, ""I want to kill him. But it would set monsters back hundreds of years"". ""Hotel Transylvania"" is a movie that parents will genuinely enjoy with their children. Though having some plot holes, such as even though Dracula stated early in the movie that he too has kept himself from the outside world away from humans for over 100 years, yet he knows what the word ""nerd"" means and recognizes the movie ""Twilight"" when he sees it. Dracula clears up a few misconceptions about vampires – MORE: [URL] HollywoodJunket.com",7.0,HollywoodJunket,2012/09/27,19,9
950,Blackfish,Review on Blackfish,"Blackfish, a powerful environmental advocacy film, goes deep into the dangers associated with orca captivity, specifically at SeaWorld, detailing the damaging consequences to both the whales and their trainers while exposing corruption at one of the country's most popular theme parks. The film brings animal rights and abuse to center stage in order to raise awareness for the suffering that these majestic whales endure throughout their lives in captivity. At a popular place like SeaWorld, many young families go to view the orcas perform, yet they are naive as to what goes on behind the scenes. Blackfish no longer wants this naivety, setting their true purpose towards advocating for an end to the use of orcas at SeaWorld due to the evidence of its damaging effects. Through the use of powerful interviews from former trainers, scientific research on whale behavior, and shocking archival footage, Blackfish is successful in building an overwhelming case against SeaWorld and for the orcas. The only weakness in the film seems to be the lack of a counterargument from current SeaWorld executives, but Blackfish uses SeaWorld's refusal to cooperate to their advantage, spinning it as evidence that SeaWorld knows they are backed into a corner. The greatest strength Blackfish has is its ability to build such strong evidence against orca captivity, primarily through former trainers recounting traumas they saw the whales face and archival footage to connect the viewer to those traumas visually. This film is especially valuable for any past or present SeaWorld attendees, because for those people, the spectacular show they saw didn't explain what it took for the whales to do such tricks. In the end, I recommend this film as important for everyone to watch, especially those who believe strongly in animal rights and are sympathetic to animal suffering.",9.0,warrenjroth,2015/12/09,3,3

952,Goodfellas,A Masterpiece That Gets Better With Each New Viewing,"Goodfellas (1990) **** (out of 4) Martin Scorsese's masterpiece about Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), a man who grew up hoping to be in the mob and he got his but crime does not pay as the old saying goes. GOODFELLAS has been called one of the greatest mob movies ever made and it's been called the best film of the 90s as well as one of the greatest films ever made. It certainly goes on my list as one of the greatest movies ever made and each time I view the thing I can't help but be amazed at the brilliance on screen. It's really does seem as if this isn't a movie because the thing is so perfect in every way that it's almost hard to believe that it's real. Even though everything in this movie is great there's no doubt that every ounce of credit belongs to Scorsese. There have been wonderful crime pictures going all the way back to the silent days so the director was behind the eight ball but instead of just delivering a great movie he instead goes all out and really creates a film unlike anything we've ever seen before. The way he films the violence, shows the good times and the bad times. Everything is so flawless that you really do forget that you're watching a movie because it comes off like you're a fly on the wall witnessing all of this stuff first hand. There's the now legendary camera shot going through the restaurant, there's the terrific music score and of course the violence that really shakes you. One could argue that we've seen this type of story countless times but it's so fresh here that you can't help but feel as if you're seeing it for the first time. There are so many brilliant moments here but special credit has to go to the final twenty-minutes or so when Hill finally starts to crack due to all the drugs. The fast-paced nature of this sequence is among the most perfect filming you're ever going to see because by the time it's over you're going to think that you too are high on drugs. Another amazing thing that Scorsese does is get you into the events in these people's lives. The good times early on are so much fun that you can see why someone would select to be in the lifestyle. The camera doesn't shy away from capturing these moments including the high times in the nightclubs with the women and the money. However, Scorsese also nails the downside when everything starts to crumble and the violence is so shocking and brutal that you then realize that this lifestyle only ends one way and you're thankful that you're not involved in it. Another major plus are of course the performances. Liotta is perfect in the role of Hill and especially when you consider he must carry the film over the more famous actors. I thought Liotta perfectly nailed not only the young, energetic Hill but he really pulled off the drug-crazed maniac. DeNiro, as usual, is also terrific in his part as he brings so much fire and energy to the character and can cause you to fear him with just a look. Joe Pesci deserves his Best Supporting Actor Oscar as there's no doubt that he delivers one of the finest villain roles in the history of film. Lorraine Bracco and Paul Sorvino are also impressive as are the rest of the supporting players even down to the bit parts. GOODFELLAS is without question one of the greatest films ever made and like all classics it's a movie that keeps getting better each passing year. Scorsese has made many great films in his career and this here is certainly among his best.",,Michael_Elliott,2008/03/07,22,13

957,The Chorus,"One-note performances, familiar refrain","It seems ""The Choir"" (Les Choristes) is a sensation in its native France, doing big box-office as a film and selling like hotcakes as a soundtrack. One imagines that France will hasten to enter it in the race for Best Foreign Film at the Oscars this year (2004). ""The Choir"" is undeniably a well-made film. But it is not a great film, nor is it even a memorable film. And it certainly doesn't deserve the golden statuette. ""The Choir"" is a nice film, a wistful bit of misty-eyed, rose-colored sentimentality. But it is farm from original, creative or imaginative. It is, instead, a rehash and a mishmash of images and ideas cribbed from other films. The conflict between a kindly new teacher and a crusty old headmaster has been done to death. There have been other, more hard-hitting films about the cruelty of life in reform schools for wayward or abandoned boys. And there have even been other films about a motley crew whipped into shape and ennobled by art, music or theater. ""The Choir"" simply follows a recipe, blends all these elements, and serves up a tepid broth that is more comfort food than cuisine. The screenplay and characterization make few demands on the cast. This is the sort of thing French actors can do in their sleep. (Perhaps they do.) Even Jacques Perrin's character, Pierre Morhange, is a throwback to an earlier role in his career. In ""Cinema Paradiso"", Perrin played a middle-aged filmmaker mourning the death of a childhood mentor, and celebrating his legacy -- a collection of film clips spliced together. In ""The Choir"", Perrin is a middle-aged symphony conductor who learns that a father figure has passed away, leaving him a legacy of memories set down in writing. Good grief, couldn't the producers of ""The Choir"" show even a little imagination, and at least cast somebody else as the elder Pierre?",,livewire-6,2004/10/24,15,7

But even if not an art movie, Les Choristes' uplifting story of a teacher arriving at a remote reform school in Auvergne is moving and engaging. The new teacher, taken aback by the rigid disciplinary measures implemented by the director, finds a different way to engage the kids and keep them out of trouble. As it is easy to imagine from the title, the device is the creation of a successful chorale to harvest the undiscovered musical qualities of the troubled youths. Gerard Junot, usually confined to comedy roles is surprisingly very effective in the role of Clément Mathieu, and the Lyon chorale does an excellent job with the soundtrack.",,PAolo-10,2004/08/13,9,4

961,Horrible Bosses 2,Painfully unfunny,"Laughless, often times tasteless waste, its plot centres on a trio of whiny, bickering imbeciles who are ripped off in the course of a business deal (because they are such imbeciles) and they plot kidnapping as revenge. When the film opens with a simulated handjob between two guys in a simulated shower enclosure, and segues into the Nick/ Kurt/ Dale misheard website line, I knew I was in for a long ride, and the filmmakers were digging the deepest depths here. The three leads are unlikeable and so moronic, their goal is a federal crime as bad as was committed against them, and the attempts at humour are so poor that several people in the audience walked out before the ending. A couple walked out when Anniston was using a dildo on Bateman's character, another pair left shortly thereafter, and one more about 15 minutes or so before the end.",2.0,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,2015/02/21,7,4
962,Interstellar,"That's not shinola you see thru that black hole, Grasshopper.","A good friend of mine, the writer Mark Shulman, once pointed out that our standards are being gradually eroded, so that sadly, we are left with less and less in lieu of a threshold of acceptability, finding ourselves not unlike frogs in a pan being brought to a slow, imperceptible boil. Christopher Nolan and some of his cast are telling the press that Interstellar is a love story. I will take them at their word and assume that whatever else I picked up on was left there unwittingly, for the rest of us to parse through. Considering how much pain is involved in traveling to and from a crowded movie theater on a Saturday night, I feel like it's my prerogative, when I have paid good money, to take a film apart if I am still hungry for substance at the end of it; and I WILL get my nourishment from something or other, if not from the movie's plot itself. The first thing that strikes me, when I think back to the experience of Interstellar, is that it leaves me with nothing, emotionally - no takeaway. I did not care about any of its characters, or believe they were real, and I did not really worry about the fate of humanity (any more than the film itself actually does, beyond paying it casual lip-service). I wasn't awed like I may have been by other wondrous space movies that Interstellar measures itself against (or steals from), and I am not compelled to go back and see any part of it ever again. (I suspect most viewers won't either, once the collective neophile contact high has passed.) For starters, I do not like the moral core of the story: Interstellar is a film about ""saving humanity"" but it is unclear who will pay for humanity's failures. The film offers a great debate over where to repopulate, but none about what we have learned from having to leave our home in the first place. There is no therapy, no penance, no sacrifice. In a way, this represents a subconscious confession about our culture's moral failures: when we run out of spaces to consume, and out of fertile ground to slash an burn, we will have to look for new worlds to expand out into, since we cannot show self control and learn to care for what we have... But enough psychobabble. A dysfunctional moral compass is not the worst thing about Interstellar. The worst thing about the film is that, to quote my girlfriend, ""It's OK to for characters to talk in pseudo-scientific gobbledygook when the show is Star Trek, because in Star Trek, they all have pointy ears."" Interstellar may be worth a glance, certainly for the photography and exciting visuals, but it is a buffet of messy ideas that fire in all directions. Clearly the script is not written by career screenwriters, but by a director who has freed himself from gravity and has achieved his own artificial self-sufficiency amid the vast nothingness. The result is an often far-fetched and unintelligible, outlandish tale which takes an awfully long time to suspend the viewer's disbelief (and cringing), to finally arrive at a tepid plot after about an hour or so. In hindsight, it makes perfect sense that Nolan's 'tightest' film is Memento, a dis-cognitive story told from the point of view of a man who is unable to string two events together, or to remember where he started. Interstellar is not an intelligent picture, but a pseudo-intelligent one. It seems designed to appeal to the sort of audience who loves to be flattered with cheap shots - a sort of space odyssey version of ""who wants to be a millionaire?"" Its success resting entirely on the fact that every member of the audience gets to feel superior. To whom? No one knows. This technique seems to be trending within the Nolan's filmography. For the rest, the picture is a narrative mess that trivializes space travel on a galactic scale, (black hole, wormhole, same difference,) and is often plagued by ridiculous star-studded cameos that shatter the viewer's concentration by landing in the middle of tense emotional scenes like a cockroach in your soup. The film is oddly timed with elliptical cuts that compress the action into some often confusing edits, and only leave in lieu of dialog some awful scenes of trite, contrived exposition, filled with emetic pseudo physics, sure to give an immature modern audience raised on Batman a sense that they are building their cultural ego by agreeing with this farce. Worst of all, it feels long and never ending. Sadly, good science fiction is hard to come by, harder than a good ordinary film even, and although this picture is somewhat entertaining, it fades away from the heart and mind, like the flickering green of the traffic light we just passed, as we head home from the cinema, once more.",1.0,sylvain-14,2014/11/09,763,342
963,The Green Mile,Rest in Peace Michael Clarke Duncan,"There's a reason why this Oscar winning tour de force is #67 ranked of all films on IMDb, despite the fact that it's 3 hours long and has some truly grisly scenes (not for the squeamish, children, or a first date.) It's chock full of outstanding performances, not only from Hanks, but also from the many supporting characters, all who are rich and full. It will seem slow to the impatient, but will be richly rewarding for those with the stamina to make it to the end. It will certainly get you thinking about capital punishment and perhaps different shades/degrees of evil. It is either a deeply moving spiritual tale or a wonderfully creepy journey down the rabbit hole of Stephen King's mind; take your pick. Either way, I put it right up there on my desert island list with the likes of Shawshank Redemption. It is definitely required watching.",10.0,epluribusunum2010,2012/09/05,69,63
964,Goodfellas,Tedious cartoon characterizations,"Many people think Scorsese is a great director because he is a skilled craftsman who produces a clear realization of his own weirdly fractured vision. Given the reverence with which some people treat his work, any criticism may be viewed as sacrilege. However, this film is filled with wooden, cartoon characterizations of real people. They do very ugly things to each other, but without any understanding of their motivations. The movie drags on far too long thanks to countless scenes that should have been shortened or cut (e.g., the endlessly long prison kitchen scene). The transitions between different phases of the movie are abrupt and without explanation. For instance, the transition to drug addiction and trafficking comes out of nowhere when the main character pulls pills out of his pocket and swallows them on his way to jail in a limousine. No drug use is shown or even hinted at prior to that scene. While the movie certainly progresses over time, and there is definitely plot development, the cardboard characters don't really change, and every scene seems like a repeat of something we just saw. Unlike ""The Godfather,"" to which this film is sometimes compared because they both depict the ""inner workings"" of the East Coast Mafia, there is no deeper insight into any part of the human condition, and only the shallowest revelations about why the Mafia even exists. The only thing we are given -- explained in clumsy narration at the end of the movie -- is that all the participants are drawn to each other because they enjoy a sense of belonging: of being ""good fellas."" While the irony between that explanation and the extended depiction of these beautifully bonded people eating their own is certainly acknowledged, in the end none of it really makes sense, and we are reminded of that too-frequently quoted Shakespeare line: It is a tale Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury Signifying nothing Macbeth was clearly talking about Goodfellas.",2.0,john_meyer,2013/06/02,72,29
965,The Green Mile,Warning to Teamsters: Bring 5 Hankies,"I went looking for an experience. Something that would take me to the limits of my own existence and remind me that even in the darkest corner of my own life, there was hope. I was reminded, instead that along with the triumph there must also be sacrifice. A part of me died in that theater, but I walked out feeling renewed, refreshed...and a little cursed. I think Paul Edgecomb feels the same way. Tom Hanks has to be the epitome of a Hollywood living legend...and the guy's only in his 40s. He went from scraping his way through sophomoric slap like The 'Burbs, Turner & Hooch, and Bachelor Party to rise up in the 90s as our towering ""everyman."" Anyone who marvels in his ""simple guy in complicated circumstances"" roles such as Forrest Gump and Saving Private Ryan knows that he can deliver the goods...and an Oscar nomination (or win...or two...in a ROW!!!) But Tom does something very interesting in The Green Mile. He lays back. The breakout performance in this film goes to Michael Clark Duncan (right now tied with Sixth Sense's Haley Joel Osment for my Best Supporting Actor vote). Crippled by his size, Mr. Duncan has a limit of the roles he can play. However, given the role of a child-like behemoth with Christ-like powers of healing, Duncan brings to the screen a performance that will transcend the Denzels and the Poitiers of the world. The Green Mile is Cell Block E in a Louisiana State Prison, death row. Paul Edgecomb run this wing with compassion, a startlingly different approach considering the legendary cruelty of southern prisons. He is surrounded by men in him employ who all share his philosophy that these men ultimately await the most devastating punishment. Why make their stay any more troubling. All save one: Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchinson), relative of the Governor and always ready to remind anyone who disagrees his HIS methods just who got him his job. Percy hates everything about The Green Mile; the prisoners, other guards, even a tiny, brave mouse who befriends one of the inmates (Michael Jeter). It isn't until another new inmate is processed, a man they call ""Wild Bill"", that Percy will meet his equal. So where is the common thread? What is a messianic character doing on death row? What role will Tom Hanks play in his redemption? And what's this ""curse"" thing I brought up in the beginning of this review? If I could tell you, you wouldn't slap the money down on the box office and find it for yourself. Let me just tell you that the final blessings bestowed by John Coffey (Duncan) could make optimists and pessimists alike find a common ground. How you perceive the final moments will be up to how you impart on yourself...and the world. If John Coffey guilty of his crime? Are the fates of the characters in this film deserved? Half and half. Evil is punished, bu t goodness must bare witness...and that has a price as well. Will Tom Hanks win another Academy Award? He shouldn't. Is this a good film? No. It's an incredible film. I still weep for Paul Edgecomb.",10.0,bldsimple2,1999/12/11,111,91

967,The Chorus,Same old song,"Good cinematography, and the music integration is rather solid. Some nice staging too. And some nice acting, mainly from the children actually (strange). But this is the same old song, ""Teacher as Messiah"" movie. Been there, seen that. The Dead Poets Society and the recent equally mushy one with Julia Roberts (don't remember the name) were enough for me. I' don't want this kind of stuff anymore, it gets annoying. And this is so manipulative. The screenplay gets rather awkward in many places, too. And as usual with many french movies (before you call me names, I AM french so gimme a break), there is no cohesion at the acting level, each (adult) actor plays in a different movie. The school's manager is very poorly portrayed. Too many conventions, too many formulas. When will these french wannabe directors learn how to work with their actors?! Jeunet, Blier, Chatiliez, Leconte do understand this aspect of movie making. Marshall is promising. Nothing like that here. The director and the actors have a different partition in their hands. Except for the children. Further, there are so many elements coming directly from ""Amelie"" (the music for example is VERY derivative) that it feels like being quite exploitative.... Oh, well, anyway, what was I expecting? I'll keep waiting for the real cool french stuff, Jeunet's next opus.",5.0,Soysoy,2004/10/21,16,4
968,Primal Fear,Dramatic Masterpiece,"From all angles this film is a masterpiece. Outstanding directing, dynamic writing, and calculated acting. Each character plays such a significant role in decisively shaping the storyline, with a display of perfect chemistry centered mostly around Richard Gere and Edward Norton. Every moment of Edward's performance in particular is necessary, present, and intelligent....satisfying the ultimate objective of the script. It leaves the viewer in a constant state of certainty, only to be thrown one calculated left hook after another as you unravel each part of the thriller/mystery in seemingly similar time spans as the character's themselves. In this regard, Richard Gere serves his purpose, supporting the development of our understanding of Roy/Aaron, while enabling a compassionate interest in the relationship that they develop.",9.0,rollingstone58,2010/06/27,2,2

Despite a directorial approach that is heavily reminiscent of Danny Boyle's, John Crowley's film is a breath of fresh air among the disappointments that continue to populate modern cinema. There is realism here, but it's not heavily emphasized upon as it is with so many Hollywood productions. Instead, Crowley lets his excellent cast and smart script do the work. Sporadic but very effective humour successfully intersperses with the drama and thrills to create a very likable concoction. You've got to like the latest fact we never knew, as well. Who would have thought that coffee and brown sauce, together, could actually be very drinkable? The DVD contains a brief ""making of"" featurette, which includes interviews with the crew and selected cast members. Rating: **** (out of *****)",,psi_fla,2004/10/11,5,0
970,Ferris Bueller's Day Off,Imagine Catcher in the Rye if it was from the POV of a teen yuppie,"After liking''Planes, Trains and Automobiles', and having taken into consideration the cult status this film enjoys i was expecting good things. What i got was an irritating little movie where the central conceit leave a bad taste in the mouth. The films message; Take a break from the mundane-take a 'Day off'-escape the banality of everyday life and find adventure. Whats wrong with that you might say? Well privileged little Ferris Bullers life is anything but mundane. He gets to drive around in a ferarri with a supermodel girlfriend in a world where he never has to take responsibility for his own actions, then sits there earnestly telling us about ''life passing him by?'' I wanted to throw things at the screen. Hughes completely misses the point in the same way Ben Stiller did recently with his awful ''Secret Life of Walter Mitty''; these people seeking something more from life already lead perfect lives so its impossible to to relate to them or understand what they have to feel hard done by about. The film is not really a Bildungsroman, it does not really deal with coming of age; its kind of a bastard relative of the baby boomer movies from the 70s but made for the brat pack generation. We are expected to root for a spoiled overachiever who believes the universe revolves around him and, as others have correctly pointed out, seems to demonstrate sociopathic personality traits.

972,Goodfellas,The greatest mob film still today,"Amazing is the one and only word to say for this film. I have always thought that Goodfellas was one of the greatest films ever made and set a landmark in the 90's or even in movie history. I bought Goodfellas last week and I got to watch the film a couple days ago. I really just couldn't lay my eyes off the film and everything about it was just simply worth watching. The acting was excellent, Ray Liotta, Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, Lorraine Bracco, and other actors did great and almost all of the characters they portrayed were 100% accurate. The camera-work also was brilliant and Martin Scorsese does a beautiful job by putting excellent camera shots in his films and I give him high credit for that. The soundtrack too is one of the best soundtracks ever made and the song ""Layla,"" put chills down my spine of how great this song fitted the film. Overall, Martin Scorsese made his best film in my opinion and him and Nicholas Pileggi made an excellent and sharp script that made this, the greatest mob film still today.

973,Horrible Bosses 2,Better than the first.,"I was not a fan of the first Horrible Bosses, so naturally when I heard they were making a lazily named sequel I ignored it. The bad ratings certainly helped with my decision-making as I sat smugly behind my computer congratulating myself on not throwing more money into the Hollywood machine. I was wrong. Horrible Bosses 2 is a funny movie and a HUGE improvement over the first and I think we can thank director Sean Anders for that by focusing more on laughs and less on the lame plot. Charlie Day, Jason Sudeikis & Jason Batman reprise their roles as friends and now business partners who create a bathroom accessory called the ""Bathroom Buddy."" Approached by father/son investors Chris Pine & Christoph Waltz, the three friends think they finally made it until at the last minute it's reviled they have been ripped off. The DVD's bonus features consist of deleted scenes and various featurettes as well as the film itself being an extended cut. The plot is secondary in this sequel and rather boring, but it's made up by the fact it's filled with a lot more laughs than the first. Plus we get the added bonus of hearing Jennifer Aniston talk dirty oh, so dirty.",6.0,Discogodfather9622,2015/02/18,11,5
974,The Chorus,Music of the heart,"The excellent film ""The Choir"" takes us back to a France of the past where the director Christophe Barratier and Philippe Lopes-Curval place their story about a school for problem children. In a way, we have seen similar situations where a good teacher is the catalyst for turning around a group of unruly students into good and productive young men and women. Mathieu Clement, is such a man. His kindness toward the children is returned to him by the students, as they respond to the way he teaches music to motivate and interest them. M. Clement has a keen sense of how to deal with the students; instead of the hard line approach the principal, Rachin, insists in dealing with them, he has other ways to make them change. The music created by the film director, M. Barratier, and Bruno Coulais, gives the film the right tone. We also hear a song by Rameau, ""La Nuit"", which is sung with such sweetness that it disarms us and get us into the right mood for enjoying ""The Choir"" even more. The film owes a great deal to Gerard Jugnot, who plays the kind teacher who sees possibilities among all these kids. His take on Mathiew Clement is the right one, because the children see in him someone that is the opposite of the other teachers and the mean principal. As the director of the school, Francois Berleand does a good job in portraying this egotistical man who can't see what his own cruelty is doing to the young people in his charge. The children are as sweet as one expects them to be. Especially Jean Baptiste Maunier, who plays the young Pierre Morhange. Also an angelic Maxence Perrin enchants the viewer as the young orphan Pepinot. Marie Bunel plays Pierre's mother well. This film is music to the ears of viewers, young and old.",10.0,jotix100,2005/03/03,75,68

One time was immediately after one orca had killed another in the tank so there was basically no show, the orcas just swam around in the tank because the trainers couldn't get in the water with them. Watching this movie is deeply disturbing. It is cruel to see what these highly intelligent animals are forced to endure. The scene where the mother and baby are separated is heart-wrenching.

976,The Chorus,"A moving French drama, well-told and with fine performances (acting and music-wise).","Despite viewing many Japanese Anime, I cannot consider myself a foreign movie fan. I don't mind watching occasional live-action flicks from places other than America, but most of the time it's hit and miss for me. That said I was pleasantly surprised to discover how much I enjoyed LES CHORISTES (or, as the Miramax DVD release calls it, THE CHORUS). Gently told and beautifully photographed, this drama from first-time director Christophe Barratier struck both an emotional and musical chord with this viewer--in fact it was enough to bring back childhood memories for me. But before I get all sappy, onto the movie itself. Set in 1947 France, LES CHORISTES tells the story of Clément Mathieu, a music composer and teacher who finds himself taking a job at Fond de L'Etang, a run-down boarding school consisting of troubled boys who are either orphans or borderline delinquents. Mathieu, a patient, compassionate fellow, eventually turns the entire school upside down when he communicates with the boys through his special talent of music. Before long, the insubordinate wards are transformed into a melodic chorus, much to the chagrin of the school's cruel and abusive headmaster, M. Rachin, who emphasizes corporal punishment as the method for dealing with misbehavior. Mathieu, on the other hand, has a different --or, if you will, kinder-- method for dealing with rowdy boys. For one thing he does not tell on them and instead sentences them to lighter consequences. Over the course of his continual (albeit forbidden) chorus sessions, Mathieu sees potential in one Pierre Morhange, a surly boy with an absolutely stupendous voice and musical gifts which enables him to become the choir's soloist. But first Mathieu must bring the troubled, quick-tempered kid out of his shell. This task is made less easier when Mathieu develops romantic feelings for Morhange's single mother, Violette; it only earns Mathieu Morhange's wrath. Eventually, however, things work out and Pierre eventually finds a career as a highly successful conductor. This is actually displayed at the beginning of the movie, where we see Morhange, as an elderly man, leading his orchestra, and later, reading through the personal journal of his former music teacher. (The whole story, in case you didn't figure out by now, is told entirely in flashback.) As entertainment, LES CHORISTES is heartfelt and uplifting without being too sappy, but as a story it is especially winning. Okay, so it may not be the most original tale --other movies have reprised many of the themes expressed in this movie countless times-- but director Barratier makes this movie ""sing"" by providing both credibility and real emotion to the characters and their situations. Aside from the numerous moments where we see the boys singing songs Mathieu writes for them, some of my favorite sequences in the movie involved Mathieu gently persuading any troubled boy into confessing their misdeed without reporting them. A subplot involving a boy stealing money from the school, in particular, turns out to be a touching episode, especially when we discover the real culprit and learn that his intentions are to free himself from the unloving walls of the school. Personally, however, this movie struck me as a delightful trip down memory lane. I used to attend a musical summer camp for several years, where I've sung in chorus. The scenes where Mathieu and his boys are performing, in particular, were strong enough to recall that special feeling of inclusion for me during the good ol' days. Speaking for the movie itself, LES CHORISTES is handsomely photographed and well-acted--particularly noteworthy are Gérard Jugnot as the kindly music teacher, Jean-Baptiste Maunier as the talented but emotionally troubled Pierre, and Maxence Perrin as a sympathetic orphan in search of his father. Naturally, since music is the subject for this movie, one would expect nothing less than the angelic sound of a boys' choir, and LES CHORISTES delivers this in full. Particularly spectacular is the song during a performance for the French countess. It helps, too, that the boys have excellent voices. (By the way, the singers are none other than the professional boys' choir Les Petits Chanteurs de Saint-Marc Choir.) Some may argue that LES CHORISTES lacks originality, especially for a film that was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film, but for what it is, this is a very moving, touching story, well executed and heartfelt. I recommend it heartily, especially for music lovers and fans of feel-good movies.",9.0,JTurner82,2007/05/06,1,1
977,Hotel Transylvania,"A new and interesting story, No real climax, needs more humour.","Throughout almost all our fairy tales we have always seen big, scary monsters and children hiding under their beds in fear that these monsters would come and eat them up.

No scary humans to come and disturb them, only darkness and peace. But when Jonathan (Samberg) a young human bag packer arrives at the castle, Dracula is petrified. Dracula's young daughter Mavis (Gomez) is eager to explore the world outside but her father refuses to let her go into the destructive and dangerous human world. The movie explores a good storyline which is the exact opposite of the stories we usually hear. The movie is light and entertaining but the movie still lacks a lot of humour.

The director Gabriela Cowperthwaite does a fantastic job with the narrative, the documentary stays neutral at all times, in order to make us analyze all the facts. beautiful cinematography all arround, amazing footage of orcas swimming in open water, we get to see their behavior in open water, they are just wonderful creatures of god. we get to know some Sea World's former trainers and why they became trainers, most of them share the same love for marine biology, ocean, or they are just people who genuine love orcas, they share interesting thoughts on Seaworld's administration. after the documentary, i actually went on youtube to see if i could watch the show, and i did, i have to say that obviously it amazed me how well trained those animals were, however, you get to also analyze their lives in the tank in comparison to their lives in open water. blackfish is a fantastic documentary for everyone who is curious about animal captivity, because in general i think this is what the director was trying to portray, is it good to keep an animal in captivity? you are the one to judge.

979,Taxi Driver,So open to interpretation that the plot falls out...,"The movie starts off with a mystery man walking into a dingy cab company and applying for a job. Something's off about him, he's friendly on the surface but underneath it there's something stiff and cold. He mentioned the Marine Corp, did something in Vietnam break him? Has he seen too many tragedies, and this waxen face is the most he can muster? Does he see the hookers and pimps, the human slime wandering the streets, and question what he was fighting for? And what about those pills he keeps taking â€“ is there some underlying mental condition? Then, driving around in his cab he sees a woman. He stalks her to her job at a Senator's campaign office, and at first we think there's going to be some sort of conflict here, but then the camera pulls in to focus on her â€“ and she's just as waxen and artificial as he is. Both of them speak with bizarre dialogue, just two degrees off of normal. Eventually he walks in, and they start dating. Then, another twist â€“ Senator Palpatine *ahem* Palantine gets into his cab one night. When the Senator asks what he cares about, he tries to explain the human vermin wandering the streets. You see fear in the Senator's eyes... but he responds with a greasy quote about working hard and changing the system. At this point I was intrigued by the movie. I wanted to see how these characters would interact, conflict with each other; I wanted to know why the Taxi Driver was slightly off, and why this woman seemed to mimic him. Was the violence eventually going to be about some political or moral principle? Or will it be an emotional, shattering break down like some sort of Shakespearean tragedy? Unfortunately, none of this came to pass. For some reason he takes the woman on a date to a... porno theatre? In between orgy scenes and Dutch dialogue, there's a microscopic view of sperm fertilizing an egg. Whatever. The girl is initially hesitant, but accedes to watch the film, only to storm out in disgust five minutes later. She then disappears until the ending of the film. When he gives up on calling her, he starts stalking a 12 year old prostitute. They go for coffee, and he tries to convince her to quit. She calls him a square. Then he buys a whole bunch of guns and builds a nifty spring-mounted holster for his arm. Then he talks to a Secret Service agent, then wanders off. There's a long winded conversation between him and another cab driver â€“ okay, I missed this part because I was busy talking about how many unnecessary scenes there were in this 115 minute long movie â€“ but the bits I did catch didn't seem that critical. Then we watch a love scene between the 12 year old prostitute and her pimp. It's romantic, and it goes on forever. We have no idea who his character is â€“ he's just 'the pimp.' Then the Taxi Driver shows up planning to shoot Senator Palpatine, screws up and runs away. After that he goes and shoots the pimp, the hotel owner, and a Mafioso. He then tries to commit suicide (never giving the 12 year old the money he'd set aside for her in an earlier scene), but he's out of bullets. For five long, long minutes we watch the camera pan over the bloody scene. Then we find out that he survived, he's a hero, and the girl went back to his parents. He's back to driving a cab, hanging out with his old cab-driving buddies (who were never fleshed out) then the girlfriend from earlier in the movie asks for a ride. He drives her home, they don't talk, and he doesn't charge her for the fare. Now the movies over. This movie fills me with rage and confusion. None of the characters are fleshed out, most of them are unnecessary to what little story there is, it's completely unrealistic â€“ not in an artistic 'suspension of disbelief' way, just a stupid way â€“ and I can't discern any point to this movie. Why does he call the street people scum, yet go to watch porn movies every night? What's his fundamental problem? Is he fixed at the end of the movie, and if so, what's fixed about him? All of this build up of him becoming Rambo, only to shoot three guys â€“ and even then, screw that up badly? What about the love scene between the pimp and the 12 year old? Why the politician? And for god's sake, why were there so many dragged out, unnecessary scenes where absolutely nothing happened? 'Open to Interpretation' means that you can use a film/novel/song as a platform to discuss feminism, politics, racism, violence, human nature, and anything else â€“ but the art itself has a distinct strand to it. This movie does not. It's sort of like the late-era Beatles' songs where they just slapped together random words... only those were at least entertaining and contained emotion. This movie had none of that. The only emotion it successfully conveyed was alienation â€“ because I'm sure as hell feeling alienated right now. Deep existential questions are troubling my soul â€“ if such ugliness as this can exist, than does beauty even matter anymore? This film is so ugly, sad, and broken that compared to it the most vigorous celebration of youth, love, and beauty is nothing but whistling in the dark as the universe dissolves into entropy, a featureless room-temperature void... I don't know if I'll ever feel joy again. Even the blue soulful depths of melancholy are a sweet fruit which will forever be gone from my life. It's with my last act of will and human charity that I beseech you â€“ if you love yourself, then please â€“ Don't watch Taxi Driver!",3.0,aurinidmj,2009/08/22,223,130
980,Intermission,Dublin Comedy,"I really enjoyed ""Intermission"" which is set in Dublin. It has a great cast who play lovable losers who take themselves too seriously. Their antics make for a funny and entertaining film. There are a number of different plot lines but the characters are all connected somehow. In some ways it's like a comic version of Babel. Dubliners seem to have a limited vocabulary and every adjective seems to begin with F, so it's not a family film. But it's fast paced and should make you laugh. The film starts when John (Cillian Murphy) decides he needs a break or intermission from Deirdre, (Kelly Macdonald) his girlfriend. She then makes John jealous by going off with Sam (Michael McElhatton), a married bank manager. Sam's wife of 14 years (Deirdre O'Kane) having been dumped embarks on a program of revenge, including sex with John's best friend, Oscar (David Wilmot). Jerry (Colm Meaney) is a police detective who likes beating people up and listening to Celtic music. He convinces a TV producer to make a documentary about his life. John and Oscar both work in a supermarket where their boss Mr. Henderson (Owen Roe) is a pompous twit. Deirdre's sister Sally (Shirley Henderson) was recently humiliated by a former boyfriend and sports a impressive mustache. Lehiff (Colin Farrell) is a thug who wants to rob Sam's bank. He is a friend of John and together they plan a bank robbery. Finally, there's Mick (Brian F. O'Byrne), a bus driver who is fired from his job and joins the gang.

982,Pulp Fiction,"Hands down, the best film of the '90s.","Pulp Fiction, despite borrowing from just about every movie ever made, is the most invigorating cinema experience a filmgoer can ever hope for. Its hodgepodge of violence, mayhem, and generally deviant behavior is an assault on the senses, not to mention political correctness. However, despite all the film's cleverness and style, it hinges on the performance put forth by Samuel L. Jackson as Jules. The fact that he was denied an Oscar is a downright shame. Martin Landau, the best supporting actor winner that year, was terrific and funny in Ed Wood, but Jackson was perhaps the most commanding screen presence in film history as the bible-quoting, godfearing hitman. The last scene in the coffee shop with Tim Roth still sends chills down my spine, no matter how many times I've seen it. Rumors of a prequel involving Jules and Vincent (John Travolta) have been floating around lately. If Quentin Tarantino wishes to regain the fans he lost with the dissapointing (but still pretty good) Jackie Brown, he should get to work right away. I'll be the first in line to see the finished product.",,verbal-15,1998/08/02,302,158

So, of course, Mavis' boyfriend gets on a plain - pining and stuff - and there's Dracula as a cute-witty bat that co-operates with the boy in an ""I can't understand what you're saying thru the window so I'm going to say the first funny thing that comes to mind"" gag and there is also a Twilight spoof to which Dracula responds: ""And this is how we're represented..."". Everything's OK then, happy ending'and what better thing to end the movie than with a ""Mirror Mirror"" like song and dance that tells the whole film plot and that's why the song lasts about 40 seconds.

986,Taxi Driver,God's Lonely Man !!!,"""You talking to me? Well, I'm the only one here."" This line highlights one of the film's most significant themes...loneliness. The story is about former Vietnam veteran Travis Bickle who is suffering from mental health problems and toxic masculinity. The first time we meet him is during his attempt to become a Taxi Driver stating to the manager that he specifically needs the job because he can't sleep at nights. Taxi Driver is considered one of the best character studies in cinema with Scorsese's direction playing a major part in it as we, the audience feel Travis' loneliness and anxiety every time he stares at a couple or a potential criminal. Scorsese puts us in Travis' point of view by having us look through his eyes using slow motion in order to make us focus wherever Travis is focusing and it's through the way he watches and observes several people that we start getting in his head. The beauty of Taxi Driver lies with the amount of information the audience receives for its main character by simply looking at the screen and noticing how the camera works and where it focuses. Whereas a movie nowadays would simply build its character through dialogue and/or exposition, Taxi Driver through Scorsese's brilliant direction and Michael Chapman's beautiful and informative cinematography allows us to know Travis without ever hearing a word of dialogue. One would argue about the fact the film has a background narration of Travis' journal entries, although that is merely used as a tool of exploring some of his thoughts, operating more as a companion to the film's main series of events while also adding to the film's noir aesthetic, instead of being an exposition dump about plot. Examples of the film's brilliant visual storytelling that convey character are scenes like the one with Travis on the phone trying to earn Betsy back as the camera pans to an empty hallway, as if the camera had a personality of its own and was embarrassed watching our protagonist's pointless and humiliating attempts or the scene in the coffee shop where he is distracted from the bubbles of his glass, showcasing his inner anger that boils within him and how cut off from the rest of the group he is or even the scene where he watches a movie, in which a man gets dumped by his girlfriend, with Travis throwing the TV on the ground breaking it because he is reminded of Betsy dumping him. There are so many more scenes with brilliant camera work that give the audience information about who Travis is and how he perceives the world, whether we're talking about the way he is so turned on by guns and the idea of enacting his crusade of blood, to the way he views black people as potential pimps/criminals without having enough context to back this up. Bernard Hermann's score creates a dream like aesthetic with his jazzy soundtrack that is often calm and romantic but hides an unsettling undertone of horror, hinting at the film's initial romantic feel that will later be swapped with a depressing journey of loneliness, despair and a cynical quest for self-discovery. Besides the technical aspects of the film that make it such a masterful character study, the other reason I love Taxi Driver is the themes it explores through its not-that-much intellectual but relatable antihero. Chapman's masterful portrayal of 1970's New York with the production design of the film being so realistic (because it was 100% real) summarize the film's case study: the decadence and degradation of post-Vietnam America and what that does to a person. Assuming Travis is indeed an honorable discharged and didn't just lie about it so that he can be more respected and accepted (notice the manager's reaction in the opening when Travis mentions he was an honorable discharged), the film tries to explore the world's now-greatest city that back then was a cesspool of prostitution, drug dealing and crime. Paul Schrader, who wrote the script drawing from his own similar to Travis' experiences, does a masterful job of realistically portraying the psychology of a lone male with a lack of basic socializing skills that is so frustrated not only with the city's decadence but with the alienation of his urban environment. The film is one of the most powerful experiences I've ever felt in film because it rarely dramatizes the things it wants to show. It is as real as it gets from a simple interaction with a woman at the beginning, that leads to Travis' brutal rejection to a robbery, that leads to Travis simply shooting a man without second's hesitation as he worries about not having a permit for his gun, with the store owner brutally beating the dead corpse of the robber with a crowbar afterwards. Everything seems so shocking because everything seems so real. The film is more reliant on the character and his actions and less on the plot, which involves two women that throughout the film Travis tries to befriend and ""save"" from other males that seem to ""own"" them. Betsy, the first woman that Travis seems to perceive as his get-away to a life devoid of loneliness and despair, rejects him (having initially won her over) after he takes her to a porno theater simply because he had seen other couples attending the theater, making him think it was ok. And that's where his basic lack of socializing skills starts to kick in, with the audience realizing his innocence, since we know it's his ignorance and not his intentions that made him take such a bad and idiotic decision and Betsy seems to understand that too: ""We're just different"" she says, as she gets into a Taxi and abandons him. Later on, Travis decides to approach Iris, a 12-year old prostitute that he swaps Betsy for. What seems to connect these two female characters is the male figures behind them. Betsy is working at the campaign office of Charles Palantine, a senator that campaigns for president of America. Although the two might have not met in person, it's the way Betsy describes and idolizes Palantine that shows us how he has put a spell on her, preventing her from realizing the truth Travis witnesses every night. To Travis, Palantine is the personification of politicians and although the film never idolizes or condemns him, it's not that hard to understand Scorsese's and Schrader's view on him (and thus their view on politicians). You simply have to look at the streets of the city that Travis roams all night...which we perfectly do. Travis thinks he knows better (even if he doesn't follow political issues that closely) and so do we, as we share his anger and just wonder how can Betsy be so attracted by someone she doesn't know and is responsible for the city's condition as opposed to a guy that was prepared to do anything for her and simply made a mistake out of his own ignorance. Taking a woman at a porno theater on the first (or any) date is indeed a bit unforgivable but we feel Travis' frustration as we probably had some sort of similar experience. Getting dumped by a woman for doing something inappropriate as a result of inexperience (first date anyone?) is totally realistic with the film simply presenting an extreme situation. Iris and her ""protective"" male figure on the other hand, are the film's more literal representations of decadence. A pimp that manipulates a 12-year old girl into being a drug addicted prostitute with their relationship being more direct and intimate compared to Betsy's and Palantine's non-physical and distant connection. Travis perceives his role as ""God's Lonely Man"" as he attempts to fill his empty life with some sort of purpose. He failed to be with his angelic savior Betsy so now the only mission that gives him some sort of purpose is to stand up against the evils of the world and become a hero. His interest is not in Iris but in the man behind her. She is just an excuse for him to go to war with the scum he is so disgusted by. And so by the end, after a brutal and shockingly violent shoot-out, that lacks any dramatization and is as realistic as the rest of the film, Travis is hailed as a hero by the public for taking out the right people. The idea of the ending being a dream sequence is romantic and ok by me, although the suggestion of a mentally ill loner being praised by the public for killing is scary, especially if one considers how he would have killed Palantine, a public figure in case he wasn't spotted by the bodyguard. The unsettling glance of the mirror serves as an indication that Travis is not well and that the real massacre begins now as he spots his next victim. In the end, what is Taxi Driver? To me, it's a film that takes the issues that a male, who is supposed to act in a certain way in order to be perceived as an Alpha-male goes though, in an alienated society that has lost its way. We all have a Travis Bickle inside of us but the film is concerned with portraying the extreme example to keep things interesting. After so many years, Taxi Driver is still relatable as we go through an age of technological prosperity, which indirectly obligates us to socialize through apps such us Facebook, Instagram and various dating apps. We go through an age of massive globalization, with urban setting dominating over the natural and even though we're now the closest with our fellow citizens, it feels like we are yet so much further. Crime, corruption and the so called ""animals"" that come out at night just like Travis says early on, are not only a thing of the past but of the present as well. Depression, isolation, the need for some sort of connection with the other sex, that seems all the more difficult due to outrageous expectations, absurd lifestyles (from both parties) and the turn to pornography are real problems existing today as they did back then. What is Taxi Driver? It is the world seen through the eyes of a depressed loner...a world not at all that dissimilar with our own...with the eyes observing it being not at all that dissimilar to that of a real-life Travis Bickle.

988,Blackfish,Excruciatingly heart wrenching to watch.,"'BLACKFISH': Four Stars (Out of Five) Critically acclaimed documentary film about killer whales and the inhumane way they're treated in captivity, as well as the disastrous outcome that it results in (both for the whales and humans). The movie was directed by Gabriela Cowperthwaite. It was produced by Cowperthwaite and Manuel V. Oteyza and written by Cowperthwaite and Eli B. Despres. It centers on a SeaWorld orca, known as Tilikum, who was involved in the death of three people. The movie is depressing and highly disturbing but it's also educational and important for most to see. Cowperthwaite decided to make the film after the death of Tilikum's trainer Dawn Brancheau (who was killed by the orca). The incident caused a lawsuit and a law preventing trainers from performing in the water next to the whales (which SeaWorld is trying to appeal). The documentary traces the history of Tilikum's captivity form his capture near Iceland in 1983. It makes a very good argument for why keeping these enormous mammals locked up (in such small spaces) is inhumane and how this treatment aggravates them and can result in hostile activity (which is what most likely caused the death of Brancheau and two others). I went to the Benton County Fair (near where I live) last summer and saw some touring wild animals, that were locked up in extremely small cages, directly across from a very loud live rock band. They looked miserable and dangerous (pacing back and forth in agitated and upset ways). That was disturbing enough but this film is even more so. It was really informative for me (as I knew little to nothing about the events depicted in the movie) and excruciatingly heart wrenching to watch. It's definitely a very disturbing and horrendous film but it's also a really important one. Hopefully things change for SeaWorld whales in the near future (and the current way of life for most animals in captivity). I think the filmmakers responsible for this documentary did a very good job of trying to make it become a reality. Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: [URL]",8.0,Hellmant,2014/01/04,12,10

990,Blackfish,This is a film that should be mandatory viewing for everyone,"The film ""Blackfish"" is shocking, and traumatizing. And it should be mandatory viewing. The documentary opens with former SeaWorld orca trainers describing how they got their job at the park. Apparently, it is not as difficult to become a trainer as one might think. While mesmeric music plays in the background, and orcas swim through sky blue Seaworld waters, the former SeaWorld trainers remember meeting their first orcas. The creatures, they reminisce, were humongous, inspiring, and beautiful. While working at SeaWorld, the trainers formed relationships with the animals (for some of them, this is the reason they stayed as long as they did.) The information that comes after this affectionate introduction is unimaginably horrific. Among the tragic fatalities explored is the death of top SeaWorld orca trainer Dawn Brancheau, who died in 2010 after the orca Tilikum pulled her into the water. Many of the interviewees had known Dawn personally, and had great respect for her. There is one part of the film that I dislike, and that is the reverence toward Dawn Brancheau. Dawn's job, her livelihood, was keeping these animals in unspeakable conditions, causing unfathomable psychological and emotional torture. Dawn proudly and vocally profited from these animals' suffering. She was either ignorant of the horrific agony caused to the captive orcas, or simply ignored it. But Dawn was one of the top trainers at Seaworld... so could she really have been so ignorant? Did she think that kidnapping and imprisoning the orcas was nurturing? When the baby calfs were ripped from their mother's side, and the mother fell into a visible, catatonic depression, emitting screeching cries day and night, trying to communicate with her child... How exactly did Dawn interpret that? The following quote is from the Dawn Brancheau Foundation's website: ""In addition to her work as a trainer, Dawn also became the face of SeaWorld. Over the years, she appeared on billboards around the world, a large mural at the Orlando International Airport, on a Budweiser beer bottle, and on many other promotional materials. She also appeared live on House Hunters, Wheel of Fortune, and FETCH! with Ruff Ruffman. Dawn was always willing to share her knowledge and love of the orcas with new audiences."" I just wonder why ""Blackfish"" commends the memory of a woman who was, literally, the face of orca torture. The former SeaWorld trainers interviewed were saddened by Dawn's death; so by the same hand, they're protesting orca imprisonment, while commemorating the warden? ""Blackfish"" beautifies Dawn Brancheau, just as SeaWorld glamorizes the lives of the captive orcas. I was also bothered by the end shot, which shows four of the former trainers on a boat, watching wild orcas swim in their natural habitat. This is unnecessary, contrived, and redundant. (Perhaps the director was aiming for a sentimental Hollywood-ish ending.) These two things only slightly dampened the otherwise very strong film. Some of the messages in ""Blackfish"" not only apply to the orcas in captivity, but are more universal; such as how marketing can completely indoctrinate us. And especially the idea that people believe what they want to believe, and that it's always easier to turn your head away, than to take action. The orcas at SeaWorld were and are subjected to heinous physical and emotional torture. The former trainers in the film talk about how on some level, at the time of their SeaWorld employment, they understood what was happening. But externally, consciously, they ignored the warning signs. It is all remindful of the old wisdom, that if one is not part of the solution, than they are part of the problem. ""Blackfish"" is a sensational documentary, magnificently enunciated and skillfully crafted. It is also one of the most horrific films I have ever seen. Within the current rating system, there is no question that ""Blackfish"" should have an NC-17 rating. And yet (paradoxically), this is a film that should be mandatory viewing in schools. Everyone needs too see this film, especially young people. It is a tough movie to watch, and so perhaps appropriately, it is also an extraordinarily important one. screenplayisles.blogspot",10.0,dylansgabriel,2014/05/04,13,11

994,Spider-Man 2,Best of the original trilogy!,"I don't care what anybody says, but this movie is one of the best superhero movies of all time as far as I'm concerned. Since the new reboot of Spider-Man came out, a lot of fans of that new film are boasting about how it's way better than this movie and the other two, how Andrew Garfield was way better and that we should all forget about Sam Raimi's Spider-Man films. They even go so far as saying all three are as bad as ""Batman and Robin"". I find that completely ridiculous. Me personally, I don't have anything against ""The Amazing Spider-Man"". I really liked it since it was nice to see a new version of Spider-Man come onto the big screen. However, it's difficult for me to erase the memories I have of going to see Sami Raimi's Spider-Man movies. I loved the first film, and was excited for the 2nd film. I still remember getting pumped every time I saw the ads for the movie on TV, and I marked everyday off my calendar up to the day it came out. I was so excited to see Doc Ock, and it didn't let me down. It was amazing! Plot: 2 years after the events of the first film, Peter Parker's life is a mess due to his commitment to being Spider-Man; he's failing his classes in school, he's messing up in his job and he barely talks to Mary Jane and Harry these days since Spider-Man takes up most of his time. Peter and Harry haven't talked much since Harry believes Spider-Man killed his father, Norman Osborn, and Mary Jane begins dating another man. Plus his Aunt May is facing foreclosure since Uncle Ben died, and Peter is emotionally shattered over not telling her the truth of how Uncle Ben really died. Peter becomes so overwhelmed with the unrelenting stress of living two lives that he gives up being Spider-Man. Things seem to go better for him, until Doc Ock comes onto the scene. Dr. Otto Octavius is injured during a lab demonstration on fusion energy, fusing four mechanical arms into his spine, and becomes Doctor Octopus (Doc Ock). Peter is then forced to become Spider-Man again to stop Octavius' rampage. I really think the story is excellent because it shows Peter struggling with everyday problems, and how he feels that being Spider-Man has brought him nothing but one problem after another. That feeling we have at some point in our lives where we just give up on life after having so many problems is very human, and I love how Sam Raimi was able to show that Spider-Man is also a human being with common everyday problems. As far as accuracy to the original comics, which fans of the reboot claim that this movie is not faithful to the comics at all, the plot in this story was mostly influenced by ""Amazing Spider-Man #50"", also known as ""Spider-Man No More"", where Peter gives up being Spider-Man, but finds himself unable to let it go. Sure there are some differences to this version: Mary Jane is the main love interest, Doc Ock is the main villain in the movie whereas the Kingpin was the main enemy in ""Spider- Man No More!"" But honestly, I don't care how accurate the movies are to the comics, because at least in my eyes, this movie captured the core of Spider-Man and that's what a superhero movie should be about. People can say what they want about Tobey Maguire, but I think he was great in this film. He makes the character sympathetic and relatable, and I really care about what happens to him. I would argue that out of all three movies, Tobey gives his best performance as Peter Parker in this one. He was good in the third one, really good in the first film, but I think this was his best performance as Spider-Man in this film. Kirsten Dunst as always is beautiful and amazing as Mary Jane (yes she is a bit harsh to Peter in this movie, but I think she is still good in this one regardless), James Franco is fantastic in this movie as he shows the rage and anger Harry feels towards Spider-Man, Rosemary Harris is terrific as Aunt May, but I have to give two thumbs up to Alfred Molina who played Doc Ock. He was incredible as Doc Ock, and very scary with those mechanical arms (in a good way). And yes it wash a bit harsh of her to leave John Jameson at the altar the way she did, but the last scene where Mary Jane (who at this point knows that Peter is Spider-Man) chooses Peter almost brought tears to my eyes, and then it shows Spider- Man swinging through New York after hearing sirens going off in the distance. One of my favorite scenes in this movie was the battle between Spider-Man and Doc Ock on top of the subway. I still get a thrill out of watching that scene, and I remember being in awe of the scene where the passengers see Spider-Man without his mask and they promise not to tell anyone they saw his face. As far as directing, Sam Raimi did an excellent job with this film, especially since he was a big fan of the comics. I don't really know anybody who hates this movie, even though I've heard the fans of ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" badmouth this movie relentlessly saying it's just as bad as ""Batman and Robin"" by Joel Schumacher (give me a break!). Like I said, I don't care what anyone says, but this movie is one of the best superhero movies ever made besides the first Spider-Man, Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Chris Nolan's Batman trilogy and The Avengers. 8 years later, this movie is still a great film to watch.",9.0,joetufano719,2012/07/27,17,11
995,Moon,"Till Now, the Most Original Sci-Fi of the Twentieth-First Century","In the future, the Lunar Industries, Inc. is the largest producer of fusion energy in the world, supplying 70% of the planet with clean- burning helium-3, the energy of the sun trapped in rock harvest by machine from the far side of the moon. The entire facility is operated by one man only, Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell), and the computer GERTY (voice of Kevin Spacey). The three year-contract of Sam with Lunar Industries is near to the end and Sam misses his beloved wife Tess Bell (Dominique McElligott) and his young daughter Eve. His only contact with Earth is through Tess and Sam is anxious to return home. A couple of weeks before the scheduled day for his voyage back to Earth, Sam is a little disturbed, having visions and daydreams. Sooner he has an accident with his vehicle, crashing a harvest machine, and becomes unconscious. When Sam awakes in the infirmary, he is without recollections and having difficulties to move, and GERTY keeps Sam on the berth in observation. However Sam decides to walk and overhears GERTY reporting the incident and updates to the representatives of Lunar Industries. Then GERTY evaluates Sam and the Lunar Industries management informs that they will send the Rescue Unit Eliza to fix the damaged machine and bring Sam back home. When Sam goes to the stalled harvester, he finds a man wearing astronaut suit trapped in the damaged vehicle and he brings him back to the facility. When he asks who the man is to GERTY, the computer tells that he is Sam Bell. Sooner he finds the hidden secret of the lunar base. Till now, ""Moon"" is the most original sci-fi of the Twentieth-First Century, with a dark and gloomy story totally believable considering the state-of-art evolution of science and technology. The impact of ""Moon"" is comparable to the 1997 ""Gattaca"", and like in the 2005 ""The Island"", shows a scary view of science, ethic and society in a near future and makes the viewer to think how cloning process shall be discussed by the society and controlled through well-studied laws Sam Rockwell has the role of his life, performing multiple clones with different personalities. GERTY, whose mission is to keep Sam safe, is a great tribute to HAL 9000 from ""2001: A Space Odyssey"".

997,Detachment,Altered realities of teenagers,"I thought this movie was a glimpse into the past when I was in high school. As a matter of fact this is one of those movies, I wished I saw earlier in my life because it is impactful to a certain extent. And gave me a more in depth perspective of today's youth. What this film shows is the altered realities of teenagers in this present time and why they feel so detached. When you are in your teens your still in that learning phase in your life and part of it is the downfall of the environments in certain schools. Which can lead to coldness, super immaturity and being ungrateful for the effort that is given to you by others. I know, because I was actually one of those students. This film shows the heroic aspects of some teachers. Watching this movie now, at a time when I started to realized certain things on this journey called life. Makes movies like these more meaningful. This is a film that is most definitely worth a watch, especially for high school students. Adrien Brody's performance is superb and all the other cast members did a good job, including Lucy Liu. Overall, I thought this film could have done a bit more when it came to the student elements, but it did a good enough job to make a 9/10 in my opinion. Plus the caving in of the teachers was done right, maybe slightly exaggerated but I am no teacher myself. Perhaps if it stayed more true to the writer it just might have been better, but it's pointless to delve upon the what if. 9/10",9.0,KineticSeoul,2014/10/01,2,2
998,Detachment,Poetic Approach & Metaphorical,"I'm going to disagree with some of the reviews I've read. I think, I believe, this film is very meaningful. It's poetic in what it portrays but also very bleek. So much in-fact, it's almost depressing. That's not to say there aren't a few joyful moments in the film, it's definitely a harsh reality as-well as an insightful way to express the issues that flood today's educational system in America. But it's much more then that, which is what I like the most about the film. It's an entire metaphor about life, it's ups and downs, how it effects everyone differently and how each individual person copes. It's symbolic in how it expresses that there is hope for those who struggle long enough to find it, if you've yet to lose yourself. If your deep into indie dramas, I say this is a good pick. Be warned, it's gloomy.",8.0,cajete,2012/02/27,16,10
999,The Chorus,The French and Musical Version of Dead Poets Society,"""The enchanting calm of your mystery...Is there anything more beautiful than a dream? Is there any truth sweeter than hope? "" Les Choristes, known by American audiences as The Chorus, is an exceptional French film directed by Christophe Barratier. It was nominated for the 2005 Oscars for Best Foreign Language Film, but ended up losing to Spanish film Mar Adentro. The beautiful song, ¨Look to Your Path, ¨ was also nominated. Les Choristes may have went home empty handed, but the film did garnish a lot of critical appraisal, and rightfully so. It is a well told story, with interesting characters, and an inspirational message. I'm not very big on comparisons, but I just couldn't help finding several similarities between this film and 1989's Dead Poets Society. The storyline is pretty similar although this film is much more lighthearted and uplifting. I was a huge fan of that movie and it is one of my all time favorites so the comparison is a good one. Gerard Jugnot might not be Robin Williams, but his performance was still remarkable, and his character is worthy of being imitated by every professor or person who works with children around the world. We must never forget the influence or words our teaching can have in young minds and it is our duty to bring out the best in them in order to make this place a better world. Les Choristes is a wonderful small film with a powerful message, strong performances, and a great musical score. The screenplay was adapted by Barratier himself from the 1945 French film La Cage aux rossignols. The story does move along at an excellent pace and you are hooked from the very beginning with this interesting film. I loved every second of it. The movie centers around a teacher named Clement Mathieu (Gerard Jugnot) who arrives at a boarding school named Fond de l'Etang in a small French town during the late 1940's. This is no regular school, the students here are known for being troublemakers, and the headmaster Rachin (Francois Berleand) runs the place with a very steady hand. Rachin believes in the law of ¨action-reaction, ¨ which means that for every rebellious action by a student, he will receive an equal reaction (some sort of severe punishment). He believes that nothing good can come out of these kids and that they can only be controlled by fear. Rachin's other assistants seem to go along at first with this method of teaching, but Clement has a different view. As soon as Clement arrives at the school he begins trying to teach the kids with a different method and opposes this ¨action-reaction¨ rule. Clement sees the good in these kids and understands it is only a matter of polishing their talents and believing in them. Clement himself is in the middle of searching for meaning in his life, a failed musician, he finds himself teaching these kids, and in doing so he discovers his true calling. He begins writing his own music and discovers that the kids can interpret it for him by forming a school chorus. One of his students, Pierre Morhange (Jean-Baptiste Maunier) is very talented, and despite being rebellious Clement finds a way to get him involved in music and makes him passionate about it. Of course there is more to the story than just this. It is told in one flashback as one of the student's reads Clement's journal in voice over so the narration is from the professor's point of view, but we also have a love story and other smaller plots unfolding before us. The story is very powerful, inspirational, and emotional. The characters are all very interesting and well developed. The performances are all very great, despite the fact that Jean-Baptiste wasn't actually an actor but a choir boy. I think this was a plus for the movie because he had a great voice and the music was just touching. Gerard Jugnot was great in the lead role and Francois Berleand was the sort of villain this movie needed. We should always see the good in people and not expect the worst from them, especially from kids who are just discovering the world and realizing their own talents. I loved the musical score in this film as well, the songs were all beautiful. The movie moves at a very fast paced and it is less than 100 minutes long. You won't regret this great film and I absolutely recommend it. Without a doubt it was one of the best films of 2004. [URL]",10.0,estebangonzalez10,2012/02/28,0,0
1000,Moon,Average sci-fi flick,"Based on reviews and overall rating, I was expecting another Kubrick's Odyssey. In this context, the movie is a letdown. The environment is very well done, although there are some unexplained simplifications, like different levels of gravity inside and outside of the lunar base. Sam Rockwell does a very good job, especially toward the ending of the movie. The movie has a very good main idea, but the screenplay does not capitalize on it. All the ""twists"" and surprises can be seen from miles away, and it fails completely in building any suspense at all. It is one of those movies where you know what could be better immediately after watching it. But it is a decent sci-fi flick, worth watching once, if you like the genre. But keep your expectations low somehow, this one is not gonna make it to history books.",5.0,lewaq,2010/01/23,21,9
1001,The Chorus,The most charming--and least believable--of the delinquent kid movies,"On a scale of charming, with 0 being ""Platoon"" and 10 being ""E.T."" I'd say this ranks around an 8. On a scale of believable, with 0 being ""E.T."" and 10 being ""Platoon"" I'd say this ranks around a 5. So there you have it, ""The Chorus"" is squarely in the realm of ""E.T."" not ""Platoon"". And if you have 2 brain cells to rub together, you probably knew this long before you read this far. The only reason I'm making this point is in case you were expecting something a little more gritty like the excellent ""Dead Poets Society"" (which, if you haven't yet seen, you must immediately flog yourself with a wet baton before seeing, pronto). ""The Chorus"" dives boldly into disturbing territory right at the outset with a scene containing some blood and another reference to suicide. My criticism is, instead of maintaining this malevolent air of drama (which would seem fitting of a corrupt 1940s reform school, every bit as formidable as the asylum in ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest""), the story instead flips into Disney territory. The dangerous juveniles who initially terrified us are instantly transformed into eager songbirds, reducing the initial drama to little more than a comedic gimmick. The story unfolds to reveal that the conflict of the story rests entirely upon the cartoonish villain, the headmaster. I felt that was the film's only letdown because the story seemed ripe to explore the complex transformation of criminals to chorusboys through the magic of music. While this did occur, it happened so suddenly that I felt like half the movie had been chopped. But if you can take this shift in stride, you'll have a great time. The kids are cute, and the music is uplifting. The presentation focuses more on comedy than hard hitting drama, so you can sit back, breathe easy and enjoy the ride. Personally I would've liked to see a bit more of a challenge in converting these juvenile delinquents, like maybe Antonio Banderas converting a bunch of NYC street thugs to twinkle toes dancers in ""Take the Lead"", or Robin Williams in the aforementioned ""Dead Poets Society"" struggling to draw the ultra conservative schoolboys out of their shells. To me, that is the draw of a story like this, but here the drama was more focused on the headmaster's antagonism. It might have worked better if the evil headmaster weren't shown to be such a bumbling fool who secretly throws paper airplanes around his room whilst standing on his desk. For that role, NOBODY comes close to Mr. Warfield in Jerry Lewis' ""Nutty Professor"". But enough with the comparisons, you're saying. Is this a good movie or a bad one? It's good, very good. So don't hesitate to watch it if you're in the mood for a nostalgic retrospective to bygone days of questionable education systems. ""The Chorus"" is a nice film for anyone who isn't subconsciously comparing it to every troubled youth flick since ""The 400 Blows"". Dammit there I go again.",,rooprect,2017/04/20,2,2
1002,Pulp Fiction,Talk Fiction. Overrated and overpraised disappointment,"I will never understand why Pulp Fiction is hailed by so many as one of the greatest films ever made. Quentin Tarintino's first film Reservoir Dogs was amazing. It had excellent performances, some good action scenes, an impressive structure and fantastic sound track. When Pulp Fiction came out in my country in October 1994, i could not wait to see it. Empire Magazine gave it 5 stars. I remember when i went up to Glasgow to see it with an anticipation i had not felt since i had went to see some thing like Star Wars or Indiana Jones. Oh boy, twenty minutes in and i was already sick to death of Samuel Jackson's character. He just talked and talked and talked and....talked. John Travolta's Vince Vega was a guy i wanted to decimate, oh Travolta you looked ridiculous with those hair extensions and then you talked and talked and talked with Uma Thurman in a silly black wig. There was so much talking in this film that it made me want to walk out. I have only ever done this once in my life and it was with that utter garbage Jack Nicholson flick Wolf. Tosh. So i kept hoping that something good would happen...Christopher Walken as an army bloke talking and talking about a gold watch up his ass...NOT GOOD...a male rape scene with talk...NOT GOOD...Quentin Tarintino turning up in a cameo that should have got him shot (in real life) talk talk about disposing of bodies...oh, this film was the pits, i must have been the only one in the audience that hated this film, because everyone was whooping and hollering like they were watching a Naked Gun comedy. Oh yes, they loved it. Quiet frankly my admiration of Tarintino was gone forever, he got his head together with the brilliant Jackie Brown then lost the plot again with the silly Kill Bill volumes. Pulp Fiction is one of the worst movies I've ever had to endure, its a long boring ride to a sore head.",1.0,CalDexter,2008/07/17,209,93

1004,Horrible Bosses 2,Horrible Bosses 2 did not disappoint.,"I really didn't know what I was getting into when I saw this movie. We all know how it goes with sequels. It's either good or terrible. It can be a win/lose situation when it comes to sequels. I was hoping it was going to be another Hangover, but I was happy when I was proved wrong. Horrible Bosses starts back up again with Nick (Bateman), Kurt (Sudeikis) and Dale (Day) with their new invention: the Shower Buddy. They are trying to make their way into the working world again, but they are now they're own bosses. They don't have to deal with the bull they dealt with their former bosses. They thought they were getting a good deal with Burt Hanson (Christoph Waltz), an investor to start up their business, only to get sucker-punched and lost everything to Hanson. They have no other options to get back the patent to their invention but to kidnap Hanson's son Rex (Chris Pine) for a handsome fee. With Rex in on the kidnapping, they think they have a solid plan, but of course, things turn upside down and once again Nick, Kurt and Dale are on their own to make things right again before they end up behind bars. The cast was amazing as always, and Jennifer Aniston returning as Julia, Dale's former boss was hilarious as always. I like to see her in roles like this because she carries comedy very well. Pine was great as well, playing the undermining, crazy, spoiled brat Rex Hanson. This film truly held its own as a sequel. They didn't do much of outrageous situations for laughs. It was just right. It was just as funny as the first one, if not funnier. I was really surprised because I know how I can be when it comes to sequels. My mother even enjoyed herself with this film, and it takes a lot to keep her interests. I would see this again because 1. I liked it and 2. I saw it at a screening and missed a few things, but I wouldn't seeing it again, even if I didn't miss a thing.",7.0,chantal-ashford,2014/11/16,39,19

Adrien Brody projects the right emotions at the right time in the movie. Sadness, happiness, joy and trauma, every feeling has its place in this movie. The use of real students and an existing school in combination with great filming gives the viewer the feeling its all real. A quality that makes a movie great. The movie inspired me.

1007,Moon,A beautiful achievement for science fiction and movies in general.,"(possible spoilers) When I first started to watch this movie, I became enthralled instantly. After about 30 minutes of the movie and especially after the scene of the crash I actually became skeptical about the plot though visually, aesthetically, and atmospherically the movie did not disappoint me in any way. I continued to watch having faith in the movie because of the many aspects of the movie that I credited towards being phenomenal. This movie didn't let me down at all! Not only is the story one of my favorite parts of the movie, it should be noted that the pacing and execution of the story is perfect. The entire movie never goes outside its realm to pay homage to or otherwise drift apart from its successors, such as the obvious 2001. I also enjoyed many tribute scenes such as Sam launching back to earth in an array of colors and lined shots of the moon and earth. It all worked for the movie. Sam Rockwell was amazing in his roles. One of the best main characters I've seen in a movie in a long time. He managed to take the movie from the beginning to end, again remaining perfectly in the boundary set by the movie, playing two lead roles convincing me and I'm sure many others that the two characters on the screen were dynamic and separate entities. As for the visuals, I can't say enough how much this movie captured what I love about science fiction movies. The technology used in the movie is credible and believable and fits the theme of the movie to a tee. GERTY is a wonderful and emotional character and dare I say, more intriguing than HAL could ever hope to be? The decisions made by this character are felt but again, never drift into a place that makes him feel like he has anything above AI. He also provides some great comedic relief and I just all around enjoy the design of GERTY. The music is enticing and catchy. Not only does it fit the mood but it develops everything on screen into something beautiful that the viewer can connect with. It's not obnoxious and overplayed but it's used sparingly at key moments to push the story. I especially loved the pick up of the music at the end and the tie in with the main piano loop to create a mysterious but much needed intensity that would've been otherwise lacking. All in all I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this film. The criticism that this movie might receive for being cliché or being too much like its successors is mislead because the movie's originality and beauty push it to mean something more. It's not just a tribute film, it's a film that can be enjoyed on any level. It's not just a scifi film, it's a story that's gripping, intense, unique and most of all, makes us think and question many things about ourselves and our world. It delivers so much emotion and sucks you into this other world. It's the very reason I love science fiction and in that, becomes not only a tribute but a major player in the films that inspired it. I give 10/10 gladly for this movie. I don't think it deserves anything less :)",10.0,valgradis,2009/07/18,10,5
1008,Primal Fear,A Publicity-Seeking Lawyer Learns His Lesson,"Martin Vail is a prominent defense attorney in Chicago who jumps at the chance to represent Aaron Stampler, a young, stuttering altar boy accused of murdering the Archbishop. At first interested primarily in the publicity that the case will bring, he comes to believe that his client is truly innocent, much to the chagrin of the prosecutor,Janet Venable. In the process of Vail's investigation,he discovers that powerful civic leaders, including the District Attorney, have lost millions in real estate investments due to a decision by the Archbishop not to develop certain church lands. The archbishop received numerous death threats as a result. He also learns that the archbishop had been sexually abusing altar boys, including Stampler.Introducing this evidence to the court, while it would make Stampler more sympathetic to the jury, would also give his client a motive for murder, something the prosecution otherwise has lacked.The trial does not proceed well for the defense, as there is considerable evidence against Stampler and public opinion holds him almost certainly guilty. When he confronts his client and accuses him of having lied, Aaron breaks down and transforms into a new persona, a violent sociopath who calls himself Roy,who confesses to the murder of the archbishop and throws Vail against the wall, injuring him.When this incident is over, Aaron appears to have no recollection of it.The psychiatrist examining Aaron, is convinced he suffers from multiple personality disorder due to childhood abuse by his own father.However, he cannot enter an insanity plea during an ongoing trial. Then,Vail sets up a confrontation in court. After Venable questions him harshly, Aaron turns into Roy and charges at her, threatening to snap her neck if anyone comes near him. Aaron is subdued by courthouse marshals and is rushed back to his cell. In light of Aaron's apparent insanity, the judge dismisses the jury in favor of a bench trial and then finds Aaron not guilty by reason of mental insanity, and remands him to a mental hospital. In the final scenes,Vail visits Aaron.But in the turn of events, Stampler reveals that he has been pretending to be insane the whole time. But he didn't make up the identity of Roy, he made up Aaron and now admits to having murdered the archbishop, as well as his girlfriend, Linda, whom the cleric also had molested. Stunned and disillusioned,Martin Vail walks away.Thus ends the courtroom thriller,Primal Fear,an adaptation of William Diehl's novel of the same title. It was one of the best films when it was released.Or I even consider it as one of the courtroom thrillers ever released.It stars Richard Gere as Martin Vail;Edward Norton as Aaron Stampler and Roy;and Laura Linney as Janet Venable.It was directed by Gregory Hoblit. Watch the movie for the performance of Edward Norton,in his film debut,as the schizophrenic murderer alone for he is simply outstanding.I believe the he should have won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor instead of Cuba Gooding Jr. in his portrayal of an athlete in Jerry Maguire. With regards to the attack of the movie to the sexually abusive priests in the Catholic Church,I think that it never in a way presented the institution as an immoral religion.They were simply baseless.I think that just as the novel was fiction so as the characters in the film although one cannot deny that there are some evil-doers among Catholic priests. Finally,the story provides great suspense from beginning to end as the immoral and publicity-seeking lawyer learns his lesson.Definitely a must-see.",10.0,Desertman84,2011/10/12,2,2
1009,Primal Fear,Exceptionally good all around,"If you want to see excellent acting in the service of an involving well told story this is a good place to start. Across the board there is not one weak performance. Gere has one of his very best roles as a fame loving attorney who chases a headline case that is more than he bargained for. He and the Laura Linney spar and parry both in and out of court with wonderful brio, she is his equal even if he is loath to admit it and the actress's personal strong persona fits the role perfectly. In a star making performance Edward Norton grabs his part by the throat and runs with it, a brilliant job and one that marked him as a true talent to watch. Each secondary roles is filled with top drawer character actors-Frances McDormand as an understanding therapist, Maura Tierney and Andre Braugher as Gere's assistants and on and on all deliver quality work. Alfre Woodard deserves special mention as the no nonsense slightly cantankerous judge who tipples a little on the side. She takes what could have been a throwaway part and makes her both memorable and humorous. A little overlong you won't notice so good is the acting and once it gets going the story keeps the interest level high.",9.0,jjnxn-1,2013/04/30,24,22
1010,The Green Mile,This movie has it all,"A great cast with great performances and a great story that keeps you hooked all the time and moves you more than once. I would like to begin this review by stating that I've never read the novel written by Stephen King. So I don't know anything about the similarities or differences between this movie and the novel. There are many things about this movie that I like a lot. One of those things is the cast, which is a very strong one. Tom Hanks, Michael Clarke Duncan, David Morse, Barry Pepper, ... All of them have a role that seems to be written especially for them. It's good to see David Morse again, he's one of those actors you commonly see, but never in a leading role. Doug Hutchinson's character is one of the most annoying I've ever seen. But perhaps that's a good thing. He really was great at being annoying. LOL :D Another thing about this movie which I like a lot is the story which keeps you hooked for the majority of its length. There are many movies out there that have a storyline that are shorter in length that have you glancing at the clock from time to time wondering when the movie will finally end. The Green Mile however, keeps you hooked and makes you curious about what will happen next and further. With a little over 3 hours, this movie only seems too long but doesn't feel that way unlike many others. At least, not when you're into this genre of movies. This story nearly has it all: it has excitement, drama, love, comedy. One moment you're laughing, the other moment you're feeling compassion with people that are being sent to death. As said, this movie is not about the deathrow, but about the people on it and about the spirituality, mystery and how everything affects the characters that spend their final hours their or work there for a living. /*** BEGIN SPOILER ALERT ***\ One of the best moments was the final moment with Michael Clarke Duncan on the chair. The sadness you could read from the faces of the guards (Tom Hanks, David Morse, Barry Pepper)... Perhaps it's not correct for them to be like that, but at the same time it is very moving and understanding. \*** END SPOILER ALLERT ***/ ALl in all, it's a very enjoyable film with a deep story that really takes you along. Within 3 hours I feel like I've witnessed their lives for months. At the end of the movie, when you start looking back at the beginning, you'll probably understand. :) Some characters probably weren't explored that much, but probably with good reason. After all, its a movie about magic, miracles, spirituality. And the persons involved with that have to be mysterious in some ways. This is probably one of the best films I've ever seen. My rating for it: 4 1/2 out of 5.",9.0,Maarten1985,2006/03/18,8,5
1011,Death of a Salesman,Flawed but still conveys the play's power,"While there were a few odd choices in the casting of this TV-movie (Or rather, the then-current BRoadway revival this film preserved), overall the powerful realism and tragedy of Arthur Miller's classic play still shine through. Dustin Hoffman has some very good moments as Willy Loman, but overall his odd physical and vocal mannerisms are a bit too distracting. Still, those good moments are really, REALLY good and enough to almost make you forget everything else. John Malkovich mumbles his way through the role of Biff. It is Kate Reid who gives the greatest performance as Linda. She feels the most like a real person and her ""Attention must be paid"" speech and her final ""Free and clear' monologue are heartbraking. Stephen Lang is suprisingly excellent as Happy, and the supporting cast is good. Tony Walton's sets (Which won him an Emmy) are interesting- not quite ""stage-bound,"" but not really cinematic, either. The whole film has that feel but it's hard to imagine a more haunting and effective score than the one Alex North composed for the original stage production, and which was used in the film. Overall, the play is so good that it really cannot have less than a strong impact, even in a flawed production like this one. But perhaps other film versions (Such as the recently re-released 1966 TV-adaptation with the original Willy and LInda, Lee J. Cobb and Mildred Dunnock) are stronger overall than this one.",,Tommy-1986,2001/10/14,3,2
1012,The Wailing,Missed Call from Shaman,"I had mirrored the bored impassive face of the main character Jong-goo within five minutes of this film starting and thus remained for the next two and half hours. There lies the first issue. Jong-goo is set up as a bumbling, oafish, bored gluttonous cop for the first half hour and in this he carries some comedic merit, we warm to him slightly as a family man just muddling through. When the unscary scariness ensues however, I found I was only left with the two moulds of reaction he'd left me - comedy or impassivity. There was nothing new in this film. We saw tired bloody chinned zombies going for the throat whilst shouting. This was farcically amusing for two seconds then boring then annoying. We saw an Asian child who shouted and cried a lot. Children have been used as scary tropes a million times and this director seemed to be dimly aware of that notion so just put one in hoping it was then scary. It was not. The irritating infant should have just been put in a box to contain it but somehow managed to run the show and kill about three people. Modernity and myth are not comfortable bed fellows and this was exemplified in jarring fashion by a mobile savvy Shaman in this film. We should at least have been jarred by some images of the supernatural but unless you count some pathetic Jim Hensonesque work at the end, this was absent. Criminally overlong and unscary meant my pulse actually slowed as the film progressed. I would have wailed had I had the energy.",3.0,timhudd-1,2017/07/30,40,20
1013,Pulp Fiction,Cinematic Masterpiece,"This movie without a doubt has never had a dull moment, there is always something bizarre or interesting happening around every corner. The cinematography is a masterpiece. Tarantino's style makes the audience feel like they're in the movie by the camera movements, and the way the story is told, is also one out of the many unique things about the film. The first time I've seen it, I was so confused on how the story was basically out of order but the more times I watched it, the more I caught onto Tarantino's style and the more I appreciated it. This movie was ahead of its time, and in my opinion considered a masterpiece.",10.0,brambilar,2019/09/27,8,6
1014,Goodfellas,Italian Storytelling,"Spoilers herein. Competent filmmakers are rare -- there is no doubt that Scorsese is competent and should be celebrated on that score alone. But his films are empty. They take you into a gangsterland (even `Temptation,' even `Innocence') and snap along until they end and then you leave. But you leave with nothing, and I expect more from a competent filmmaker. The problem -- I speculate -- is the degree to which Scorsese is locked in the Italian tradition of storytelling and its 60's incarnation in neo-realistic films. This is a matter of performance, where the force of the story is all in the force of the storyteller. The performer here is Scorsese. His screen persona is epitomized in the Pesci character: driving, driving the group by pressing on. By speaking over others. By showing the threat of violence. There's power here. It grabs your attention like Pesci grabs that of the fellas. I can see Scorsese constantly saying to himself that he'd be nuts to live any other way. But aside from some storytelling mechanics, there are no ideas here, no ambiguities, no interesting characters, no plot maturity, no symmetries, nothing to wonder about and discuss on your way home. But we should salute some of the decisions. Scorsese chooses to frame the film as a story told by the Liotta character. (He plays an Irishman, but looks and acts Italian.) Narrative voiceovers. A clever framing device with us locked in the car at midway through and mirrored in the beginning. The end with Liotta looking directly and speaking into the camera and shooting us. And the camera. Much has been said of the camera. The long, tracking shots, especially the much-copied entrance through the kitchen. The pullback-zoom toward the end when Liotta and DeNiro meet. The occasional corner ceiling shot. Normally I would love this, especially since it is in the framework of a consistent notion of the eye. What bothers me is what that eye is: it is dependent on the characters. The characters drive this movie and pull the camera. Consider the kitchen entry scene: the camera is on a string behind Liotta. We follow, always follow, just as the fellas at Pesci's table have to follow his prattling. Compare that to dePalma's similar long tracking shot of Bruce Willis at the start of `Bonfire of the Vanities.' DePalma's camera isn't dragged along behind by the force of Willis. It floats to the front, the side, swooping around, independently curious. We the viewers are masters of the story. It's the difference between the northern and southern European storytelling traditions. Seeing how little deference the camera gives us really grates when the payoff is so slight. It makes DeNiro pretty hard to take. Yes, we all get impressed by the power of his performance. But it is always clear that it is a performance: we are not seeing a character but a `serious actor,' employed as a tractor to pull us along. Is this a great film? Well, it did not change my life, give my dreams new form, or provide the basis for any meaningful discussion with my wife. It didn't help me define myself or my world. It provided no new perspectives on the things I struggle with. (And many, many films do one or more of these things.) So for me no. What a waste.",,tedg,2002/05/22,97,50

You remember that, QT, don't you? Don't you? I could complain that the plot twists are contrived in ""Intermission"" but that would bring me back to Shakespeare's comedies of love. Instead of fairy dust, the script has steak sauce to help tie things together, and an evil imp in a red jacket who hurls rocks at the windscreens of various comic scapegoats. And like Shakespeare, not all the disappointed souls find exactly the same happiness. And there are sweet sorrows too: one scene between a widowed mother and her lonely daughter pierces the heart.

1020,Hotel Transylvania,"A good film that consolidated Sony's place as a great animation studio, but that still has problems to solve.","This film is one of the best that Sony Pictures Animation has made, finally putting it at the level of Disney, Pixar or Dreamworks. These four giants of animated films have been fighting for a long time. Sony has so far been the most discreet and least successful competitor, however, with this film and the ensuing franchise, the studio has finally managed to show its worth. The script is simple: after losing his wife in a confrontation with violent humans, the secular Count Dracula hides, with his daughter Mavis, in an isolated castle, protected from the humans eyes. To make it profitable, it turns it into a large hotel specially designed to welcome other monsters and creatures that want distance from people. But, as the centuries go by, Mavis has grown up and wants to finally see the world beyond the immense dark forest that surrounds the castle. And that is what Dracula is most afraid of, as he regards human beings as highly dangerous. The film was perfectly capable of humanizing and giving a funny touch to the monsters that we get used to seeing in horror films. Dracula, the Mummy, the Werewolf, Quasimodo, the Invisible Man, Frankenstein's monster, Bigfoot... they're all here, and all of them much more human and lovable than they could be in another kind of film. The plot rests on the father-daughter relationship, on the way a father tries to protect his daughter until eventually she feels suffocated and revolts against it. The most comical scenes are reserved for the Count, especially when he plays with Jonathan, the human teenager who, against all odds, finds the castle and decides to explore it. The dialogues are excellent and the humour is everywhere. The direction is ensured by Genndy Tartakovsky, who previously collaborated with Cartoon Network Chanel, where he was responsible for some of their most iconic animated shows. It is, therefore, an interesting bet that worked very well. The voice actors cast is large and very good, with the veteran Adam Sandler and Selena Gomez at the head. Everyone did their job very well and fit the characters perfectly. I found Sandler's effort to make his voice more Romanian especially interesting, although it might not be necessary. Technically, the film is based on computer animation and CGI, whose quality seemed somewhat irregular but generally good. Unlike the films from other studios, music and songs are far from being the strong point here... in fact, it was one of the weakest bets in this film, with forgettable songs that seem to be there only because they have to be there, without being able to add quality and joy to the film. The ending, where music plays a predominant role, ends up a little blurred because of that.",8.0,filipemanuelneto,2020/06/24,1,1

One cannot find a single weak cast member! Michael Jeter should have got an Oscar. Michael Clark Duncan put just the right shading on his huge character to make him vulnerable and sympathetic. Flawlessly shot on perfect period sets, the whole production binds together to bring the extraordinary story into the realm of a believable and compelling study of human injustice and charity.",10.0,jlacerra,2001/06/17,287,230
1022,Goodfellas,An Offer You Can't Refuse...,"""As far back as I can remember, I've always wanted to be a gangster."" -- Henry Hill, Brooklyn, N.Y. 1955. Gangsters are all around us. Everyone knows it, not everyone wants to accept it. ""Goodfellas""--based on true events--explores the lives of gangsters, chronicling the events through the eyes of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), who gets involved with the Mafia at a young age and continues his ""career"" throughout the film. As he gets older, he marries and has children, but still works for the organized crime family, under mob boss Paulie (Paul Sorvino); and he is friends with Jimmy (Robert De Niro), a calm, steady gangster; and Tommy (Joe Pesci), a wild man with serious mental problems. Eventually Henry's life goes down the gutter, leading to drug abuse and paranoia, that leads to other unfortunate incidents that will be ruined if I type any more about them. ""Goodfellas"" is one of the best films I have ever seen. It's a tour de force of breathtaking images, witty scriptwriting, superb acting and realistic violence. Robert De Niro gives one of his best performances -- ever -- as Jimmy, even if he's not in the film as much as you might be lead to believe from the front cover. Joe Pesci is in this movie about as much as De Niro, maybe a bit more or less. But when he's on screen there's no doubting he's on screen--he's very hard to miss. A short, deranged, loud-mouthed man with something wrong in his head. Someone makes an insult toward him and he shoots them, and then laughs. It's quite disturbing. I am a huge fan of Pesci, and I tend to love his characters, but he really makes you feel sick towards his character in ""Goodfellas,"" while at the same time taking a strange liking to him. That just goes to show how good of an actor Pesci is. Ray Liotta is perfect as Henry Hill. I can't think of a better actor to play him. He captures a sense of innocence yet at the same time a feeling of violence. I love the scene where he walks over to a man's house with a regular expression on his face. ""What do you want, f&*^&?"" the man asks. Liotta continues walking, takes out a gun, and starts to continually beat the man in the skull with the butt of his gun. As Henry walks back to his car, his face is disturbing and his expression stays with you for a long, long time. Martin Scorsese is a brilliant director and his work here is fabulous; it's been recreated by other directors (namely Paul Thomas Anderson in ""Boogie Nights"") and there's a reason: it's great stuff. He totally deserved to receive Best Director in 1990, but of course he didn't. (Rumor has it the Academy frowns on Scorsese's use of racial slurs in his work. Oh boo hoo, get over it.) The movie is based on the true-crime memoirs of the real-life Henry Hill, whose novel with Nicholas Pileggi -- ""Wiseguys"" -- was adapted into a screenplay by Pileggi and Scorsese. The book itself was fantastic and insightful; the screenplay is even better. The dialogue is incredible. Anyway, ""Goodfellas"" has to be one of the best films I've ever seen--a true modern classic that will be remembered for what it is: One of the greatest tales told on screen. It's an offer you can't refuse!",10.0,MovieAddict2016,2003/03/31,683,521

1025,The Wailing,"Horror on the Surface, Satire Underneath","The Wailing may look like a generic and light-hearted horror movie on the surface. However, by delving deeper into the story's plot, evidences of satire that is related to the second World War and the Japanese invasion of Korea can be seen clearly. At the center of the satire, is the Japanese man who represents the war era Japan that had invaded Korea, resulting in the death of many men, women, and children and the emergence of ""comfort Women"" which was in reality the prostitution of young women and even girls. For instance, the young woman in white may represent the Comfort Women. There is even a a scene in which the Japanese man chases the woman in the jungle. And in another scene, he attacks another woman in an attempt to rape her. There are also other traces of rape and sexual abuse in women. For example, most women seem to have contracted a disease that is somewhat similar to that of an STD that has also transferred into men. And the policeman's daughter's thighs are bruised. Later, she also confesses that she has met the Japanese man. Moreover,the Japanese man's cleansing practice in the waterfall may represent Japan's attempt to cleanse its past, but to no avail. The whole village and maybe even the policeman stands for Korea, and the people are the nation. Nobody trusts the Japanese man, nobody likes him, but no matter how hard they try, they fail to drive him out of the village; he is there to stay and to make sure that everyone is consumed. One by one, the families fall victim to the Japanese man (or the Devil) who fall upon them like a disease. The disease then spreads until it consumes the whole village. Finally, the Shaman is a representation of traitors that allowed Japan to take over the country for their own personal profit. All in all, the movie has skillfully illustrated the horrors of the war, and the feeling of helplessness and darkness that takes over a country during such a period.",10.0,evemas-am,2018/03/16,21,10
1026,Hotel Transylvania,"Very interesting and funny movie, once you get past the first half-hour.","I know there are many anti-fans of Adam Sandler, but you got to give him credit, he is amazing as a voice actor in animated movies. Here he is Count Dracula, yes the real one. And as he explains over his long lifetime never has said ""blah, blah, blah"" at the end of his phrases. Dracula and all the other monsters feel threatened by humans who always want to hunt them down and kill them. So many years ago he found a very secluded place in Transylvania and built the large, castle-like Hotel Transylvania, almost impossible to find, as a refuge for his family and all the monsters who want to visit there. Selena Gomez voices Dracula's daughter, Mavis, who is having her ""big"" birthday, she is turning 118. Her mother had long been departed but had left a gift for Mavis, to be opened on her 118th birthday, it was a reflection on finding your true love. Dad didn't want his headstrong daughter to actually visit a real human city, as she desired, so he built a fake city not far from the Hotel. She visited it, was disappointed, and returned home. But Dracula's inept monsters playing humans set the fake city on fire, this attracted the American hiker, Andy Samberg voicing Jonathan. Dracula is mortified, much like the Monsters in ""Monsters Inc."" reacted when the little girl found her way back to their habitat. Anyway perhaps predictably Mavis and Jonathon fall for each other, Dracula wants to keep them apart, and the funniest part of the whole movie, near the end, is when Jonathon is on a jet liner, and Dracula has changed into a bat, and is hanging onto the jet liner window trying to communicate with Jonathon, while starting to smoke from the burning sun. You know, Vampires cannot be in the sun. Anyway, the first 20 to 30 minutes of the movie, used to establish the basis for the story, was somewhat tedious. But the last hour or so is totally entertaining.",,TxMike,2013/05/02,3,2
1027,October Sky,Early Jake Gyllenhaal in a Joyous Film,"October SKY is a film that is sorely needed right now, a film to buoy our spirits and re- launch our sense of wonder. Based on a true story - ROCKET BOYS by Homer. H. Hickam, Jr. - it is everything young people should see to remind them that dreams are indeed possible. The story takes place in the little mining town of Coalwood, West Virginia in 1957 when all eyes were focused on the seemingly unreal launching of Russia's Sputnik. Homer, Jr. (Jake Gyllenhaal, with all of his innate charm intact even then!) longs to get away from his presumed destiny of working in the coal mines upon graduation from high school. But Homer's ideals are higher and with the aid of his friends he designs and launches a little rocket that at first angers his miner father (Chris Cooper) but excites his teacher (Laura Dern), who assists Homer in his dreams of rising above the frustrating level of his life in the little town to accomplish dreams he never thought possible. There is just the right amount of tender humor, status resistance, and recreation of a period of time in our history when suddenly everything was possible if a rocket could place a satellite in orbit and transmit signals to the earth. For those of us who lived it this film is an enriching memory, and for those who didn't witness it, the film offers a true sense of the possibilities of the open human spirit. It is a delightful little film. Grady Harp",10.0,gradyharp,2011/02/20,2,2

I know the three of them are meant to make bad decisions constantly because it's part of the humor of the show, but for me, all it was, was extremely exhausting, and it was mainly to do with Charlie Cox being the squeaky, childish idiot, who can't keep his mouth shut.

1029,The Green Mile,It's not a great film just because they made you cry.,"Nice packaging, but too much of it. Typical Stephen King story, well-told but not much weight. Full of stereotypes and predictable good guy/bad guy stuff. I loved Tom Hanks in ""Philadelphia"" -- that was a challenging role and he performed it magnificently, with depth of character, pathos but no sentimentality. Ever since, though, he's taken on one interchangeable role after another. Enough, already. The sad thing is that I truly CAN believe that almost 50% of the IMDB voters so far rate this very average and over-long film as a ""10"". Excellence apparently is a function of the volume of tears they make you shed. I say, ""make you"", because I think this film fully intends to manipulate emotions -- the emotions of white, comfortable, middle class Americans who enjoy cheering for the oppressed, simple but pure of heart big black man who is abused by Southern crackers. Aren't we glad we're not like that? Yet again, a black man gets to be a parody, not a person. We white folks don't have to be afraid just because he's big and black, see, 'cause he's really a Jesus figure (""J. C."", his initials). What a relief. Still wouldn't want him living next door, though, would we? All in all, good actors playing two dimensional roles. In the real world, as Kosovo and Northern Ireland and Rwanda show, we're all just a hair-trigger away from being cruel. Let's have more films that recognize that there are few good guys and bad guys, just a whole lot of us doing the best we can and trying to do it right. That's too complicated for most Hollywood types, and doesn't usually make much money. ""Dead Man Walking"" was ten times the film that this one was, and even it wasn't a ""10"". ""Besieged"" and ""The Informer"" were so much better than ""The Green Mile"" that to mention Oscars without naming those films is ridiculous. And that's all this middle-aged long-time and ardent lover of films has to say.",1.0,Dr. Don-2,1999/12/24,142,43
1030,October Sky,It was hard to choose your future in the 1950s for a worker's son.,"A simple and effective film about what life is all about, responding to challenges. It took a lot of gall for Homer and his friends to be able to grow into manhood without falling in the trap of a prefabricated future that runs from father to son, to be a miner in the local mine and never get out of that fate. It took also three different challenges for Homer and his friends to conquer a personal and free future. The challenge of the first ever man-made artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, a Soviet satellite, a milestone in human history, a turning point that Homer and his friends could not miss, did not want to miss. Then the challenge of science and applied mechanics to calculate and to devise a rocket from scratch or rather from what they could gather in books and order in their minds. Finally the challenge of a world that resists and refuses and tries to force you back into the pack, even with an untimely accident that forces you to get back into the pack for plain survival necessity, and even then Homer proved he had the guts to accept the challenge that was blocking for a while his own plans and dreams. But there is another side of the story that the film does not emphasize enough. Homer is the carrier of the project but he is also the carrier of the inspiration he and his friends need. If he is the one who is going to get the university scholarship, because his friends gave him precedence, his friends will also be able to get on their own roads and tracks and step out of the mining fate, thanks to the energy his inspiring example sets in front of their eyes. It is hard at times not to follow the example of the one who is like a beacon on a difficult road. But the film is also effective to show how the father resisted this dream because for him science was not the fabric of a true man, like mining or football. The working class fate that was so present in those 1950s and 1960s and still is present in some areas is too often enforced by the traditional thinking of the father. If the mother does not have the courage to speak up one day, the working class fate I am speaking of becomes a tremendous trap. Here too the film is effective and it should make some parents think. This might have been the fourth challenge Homer had to face: the challenge of taking a road that was not the one pointed at and programmed by his own father.

1033,Goodfellas,I'm the first to admit that Gangster films are not really my favourite!,"Scorcese's masterpiece, that's probably the best way to describe it; he takes us on a journey through Henry Hill's (Ray Liotta's) life, from boy to man, as he climbs through the ranks of the mobster scene, and Ray Liotta gives the performance of his life. Supported by great characters portrayed perfectly by Robert De Niro, Lorraine Bracco and the star of the piece Joe Pesci; this movie simply overflows with style, talent and guts. It's incredibly violent and it's brimming with vulgar language, but every bit of it is warranted as a piece of the picture. Now i am the first to admit that i am not a big fan of gangster movies, but i cannot fail to appreciate the magnificence of this excellent film.

I think the reason why I like this movie so much is because of the chemistry of the the three main characters Jason Bateman as Nick Hendricks, Jason Sudeikis as Kurt Buckman and Charlie Day as Dale Arbus. Personally I think those three really made the movie what it is. Also the way they interacted with each other added some comedic effect to this movie. The supporting cast in this movie as did a great job some particularly memorable performances were by Kevin Spacey as Dave Harken and Jamie Foxx as Dean ""MF"" Jones. The biggest complaint about any comedy is that it wasn't funny. While a few scenes of this movie might not have been funny, I feel that the funnier scenes made up for this. Also the plot was interesting enough to make up for some of the unfunny scenes in this movie. I give the filmmakers credit for not making the exact same plot as the first movie. This movie has a different premise as the first and this adds a lot to the movie. For me, this movie's storyline was not very predictable. This added to my enjoyment of this movie. In Conclusion I think that what makes this movie 8 out of 10 for me is a great chemistry between the starring cast. The supporting cast in Kevin Spacey and Jamie Foxx added a lot to the movie. Also not only was this movie funny but it had an interesting story line that was not the same as the first and the plot was not very predictable.

1037,Detachment,Touching and an interesting approach,There have been quite a few inner city school movies highlighting the terrible conditions that both teachers and students face there. So why give this one a watch? Look at the cast - they wouldn't be doing this movie if it didn't have good material. This movie is quite well done and the approach is fresh and watchable with a realistic plot. The cast is good. Brody is quite touching as are the students. Hendricks is a little too pretty for the role but is lovely to watch. Overall a little depressing because of the serious subject matter but worth a watch.,8.0,phd_travel,2012/07/28,6,5

1039,Hotel Transylvania,A Roller Coaster Ride of Fun And Horror,"I grew up on the Classic Universal movie monsters of the 30s and the 40s, so I definitely had to see this movie, and overall, I think it's a pretty strong movie with few weak points. Of its weak points, it has too many non-generic creatures. Dracula creates a hotel for monsters, but in the movie, ""monster"" remains unspecific. The castle is teeming with ghosts, walking dead, cryptids, mutant freaks, outcasts from society and a few mythological beasts. It could have been entirely devoted to ghosts, undead creatures and demons, but instead, it goes a bit too far with a few creatures that defy explanation and identification. The hotel is meant for these outcasts of society to exist alongside each other away from humans (shades of ""Monsters vs. Aliens) – somehow forgetting that many of these beings were once human themselves. There is a buried political statement here about how society treats its outcasts, but the point is never addressed. However, this cacophony of contradictions is pushed to the background because the main plot is mostly about Dracula (Adam Sandler) being over protective of his daughter, Mavis (Selena Gomez). Mavis was originally going to be played by Miley Cyrus, but backed out. This works well to the film's benefit because Miley's Tennessee accent would not have worked for the sheltered daughter. Not only that, but Selena does pull off the innocent effervescence required for the character. As Dracula, Sandler's signature voice is practically unrecognizable with the thick Slavic accent and sounds at times almost exactly like Bela Lugosi. It is into this world that a lost hiker voiced by Adam Samberg wanders, and Dracula quickly tries hiding him as a relative of one of the body parts of the Frankenstein Monster, once again using the name of his creator. The movie has a fast and furious roller coaster parade of jokes and scenes; the best material comes from Steve Buscemi as the harried Wolfman as the father of a litter of kids who fail to respect him. At one point, Dracula asks straightly: ""Do you have any kids left who still respect you?"" There are also a few gags from Dracula suffering the indignity of years of bad Dracula impressions and alleged vampire misconceptions. When getting a look at ""Twilight,"" he asks very forlornly, ""Is this what my legacy has come to?"" The movie has a top-notch cast of comedy actors including David Spade, Kevin James, Jon Lovitz, Fran Drescher, Molly Spade and Cee-Lo Green as the singing voice of a fat mummy. The animation is superb; it may not be as top-notch as ""Brave,"" but then, why are we expected to have these 3-D movies compete with each other in animation? While the movie does tend to drag down on logic at times, it pulls together with the zest and appeal of a carnival fun house, and if the animation over the credits is any indication: I could see the movie siring an animated TV cartoon.",9.0,aesgaard41,2012/10/02,5,3
1040,Death of a Salesman,Excellent presentation of a classic,"Certainly not the definitive version of this classic play about the American Dream morphing into mental illness, but worth your time because of the power of the performances and the underlying drama itself. Dustin Hoffman's quirks and enthusiasm represent a slightly different take on Willy Loman – many others see the character as more phlegmatic – but it's an effective characterization. As his wife Kate Ried does a more than serviceable job, but it's hard to believe she's married to this guy – their physical types just don't match. Furthermore she delivers some of her more powerful dialog sitting in a chair, a static staging that the director must be blamed for. Other performances are very strong, including Charles Durning's Charly who blends equal doses of frustration and sympathy for Willy's plight. Durning's the character who may best understand not who Willy really is, but the pain the man feels. Jon Polito and Linda Kozlowski are great in their one-scene appearances, and Stephan Lang is good as the emotionally stunted younger son. But this edition of salesman best showcases John Malkovich as the older boy Bif who experiences the play's closest beat to real revelation. (Even his ""younger"" self in high school is believable, at least within the context of a filmed play.) Free of mannerisms that sometimes characterize his latter work, Malkovich genuinely conveys the outrage and, then, sympathy provoked by his father. He's the strongest acting element in this rendition of a play that is sound, timeless, meaningful, and a real American classic.",8.0,davdecrane,2010/03/03,2,1
1041,Detachment,Haunting.,"There's something utterly haunting about this movie. Something that lies within the whole atmosphere created by the atypical cinematography & the story itself. I've seen this film three times and am touched every time a bit more. Henry Barthes is one of the most haunting, wounded character I've encountered in films, movies or whatever and the portrayal done by Adrian and, once again, the cinematography communicate perfectly his sadness and the whole helplessness & unforgivingness I felt characterized this story and, well, life itself - in fact, almost every characters in this story is wounded in one way or another and actresses & actors did a great job. For everyone who enjoyed this one, I recommend Short Term 12. Seen this one today and it made me thought about Detachment for some reasons - read there that there's some similitude in the theme and that both of them had me crying almost the whole time.",10.0,Polygone,2014/05/20,6,4

But once you got pass that the plot kept moving along very well for a court room drama movie. Edward Norton was Excellent in his role! I would have liked to seen more of Andre Braugher's character and how his behind the court room scene work helped Richard Gere prepare his case. The ramifications of the underlying story between John Mahony and Steven Bauer would have been an added benefit to viewer. An answer to the question: Did he get away with it?

1043,Interstellar,A Brilliantly Emotional Journey,"I just returned after seeing ""Interstellar"" again (2nd time) and I can say that my second experience was even more powerful than the first. I'm trying to find the right words to express the thrilling journey that is this film. First I'd like to advice you to try and pay attention to every single line - nothing is said without purpose and everything is somehow connected. It slowly builds up with the beginning to this phenomenal emotional ride and it will not let go until the very end. It will keep you on the edge of your sit - literally -, it will make you cry, it will make you jump, it will completely absorb you. Throughout the course of it I forgot I was in a cinema. I was living every single moment with the characters, feeling what they're feeling. At times, I found myself staring blankly trying to comprehend its complexity - How can this be? Is this really happening? Can it be so epic? The second time I saw it I understood the importance of every single scene and line, I saw more connection, more intricacy and (even) more genius in it. The first time it was grand and overwhelming, it just hit me hard and I couldn't really pay attention to details. The emotional journey part was very important to me; but of course, there are the stunning visuals which contribute immensely and transcend you there, into the action. They were fantastic, superb, simply put, film-making at its finest. This is all, of course, from my point of view - a super sci-fi, fantasy, adventure and all associated genres enthusiast. Although I cannot imagine how one, regardless of their movie preferences, can dislike ""Interstellar"" - it's that good. What I'm obviously saying is GO SEE THIS MOVIE. Expect epicness. It will not disappoint.",10.0,liana-moisescu,2014/11/09,134,72
1044,Pulp Fiction,I like the vibe to the movie,"I really like the way this film was orchestrated: from the way the story is told to different camera shots, you can tell a lot of time was put into making it. I watched this film as it is a cult movie (one everybody should watch) And it is arguably Tarantino's best film. The overall experience was great as you can really connect with the different characters and quickly get sucked into the movies plot. I recommend this to any aspiring movie nerd or Tarantino fan as it is very enjoyable. And you yourself will still be wondering... what was in that brief case?",10.0,leonardocellino,2020/07/27,9,8
1045,Pulp Fiction,A masterpiece? Do me a favour!,"A masterpiece? Do me a favour! Perhaps it's because of the hype that surrounds this film, but I was really disappointed with what I saw. Two and a half hours was too long in my view, and nothing particularly out of the ordinary happens. I didn't find it clever, nor were the ""unforgettable"" scenes like the dance between Travolta and Thurman or Samuel L Jackson's speech unforgettable. Maybe because cinema has advanced so much since 1994 that I would have had to watch it then to appreciate it, but I only recently saw Hitchcock's Rear Window for the first time and enjoyed that immensely. People go on as if this film has the best storyline and gangster scenes ever but quite frankly, it doesn't. Moreover, I found Natural Born Killers more affective for it's style than Pulp Fiction. It does have some good scenes, and I was rooting for Bruce Willis' character throughout, but I saw nothing that makes this film outstanding or worthy of being so high in IMDb's rankings.",6.0,adamgreasley,2008/05/18,257,131
1046,October Sky,Hope is Quintessential,"Well I have seen the cynics comment on this movie and their eye for details...just one word for them what ever u say is ""hogwash"". What is movie making all about?? In my opinion its about bringing things to life to inspire not to be pin point accurate, but to give a view which some may agree and some may not. I saw people commenting about the whole town coming to see the rocket launch well i think its a symbolic gesture, as those rockets stand for hope and belief and thats what this movie is all about. If you can see Forrest gump with the same eye it's without sense but that movie also depicts the victory of human spirit over all overwhelming odds to have faith when everyone looses it. The only people who can be cynical about this film are those who have given up and in their despair see everything beautiful as a threat,, pity them. Its a shame that the movie didn't even achieved a Oscar nomination, goes on to show how banal and frivolous these awards are.",10.0,wadsam,2005/12/16,2,2
1047,Death of a Salesman,A little too accurate to the play,"Death of a Salesman is one of those plays that some people love and consider it a classic and others hate because it isn't entirely accurate with history and doesn't seem to quite work. I honestly don't mind the play BUT the movie... that's a different story. The movie decides to be a little too accurate to the play... and by a little too accurate I mean it is almost word for word exactly the same as the play and virtually scene for scene the same. I actually watched it with the script of the play in front of me and found only a few minor things altered. Now Romeo+Juliet did it and that movie didn't turn out half bad, but what do I find so annoying about the way this movie does it? Maybe it is because the movie is literally on stage-set... I'm not even joking, when the characters look at the ceiling there is NO CEILING! Just an opening of the set! There aren't even walls to the house, they are just movable pieces so there are huge gaps in them. While some people might find this ""unique"" that a movie decided to make a stage adaptation and make into a film, I can only say this: Why in the world would you make it into a movie with this format? I mean seriously, I watch a movie to watch a movie and to break the realm of a play. A movie is simply a play with more freedom and more opportunity to tell a story. But this movie restricts the freedom that is given to a movie and tries to limit the power of the story and make it just a play. I still have no idea why someone thought that was a good idea! Plays are plays and movies are movies. You might as well go on youtube and just watch a video of someone recording the actual play. There is no reason for this movie to pretend that it is a play. Now how is the acting? Well... pretty darn good. Dustin Hoffman gives a solid performance and all of the actors do pretty well. All of the acting is done well and I think everything the play was trying to portray was portrayed in the ""movie"". If there was one problem I had with the play and with this film is that the son is too much of a coward to tell his mom why his father and him are arguing. Pretty much every problem that occurs in this movie could be easily resolved if everyone was just a tad bit smarter. It makes me mad when there is a conflict only for the sake of conflict. I find it a bit unrealistic that the conflict didn't get resolved, because it is evident that if everyone knew the truth then everyone would be at equal grounds and a resolution would take place. But alas, that is not how the story goes. Overall, the Death of a Salesman isn't a terrible movie, but it isn't really a movie. It is a play. That is why I don't really consider this a good movie because it isn't a movie. In all honesty, if someone were to film the play A Death of A Salesman and release it in theaters I bet it would get extremely low reviews because it isn't a movie. I feel like if this ""movie"" would've attempted to transfer the play into a movie format I would've been able to enjoy it a bit more, but all of the glaring mistakes of a play are still obvious in this movie. I'm sure it was a cute ""joke"" when this movie was made, and at first it was kind of funny that there was no ceiling, or no walls, but it quickly wears away at the movie once you realize the movie is just being cheap.",5.0,FairlyAnonymous,2013/04/26,9,3

What more could you want from a tale than a simple story of hard work, determination, and a little bit of lunacy thrown in (ok, that's the mom in me talking)for inspiring kids these days?

1049,The Fault in Our Stars,No fault in these stars,"""The fault in our stars"" is an amazing love story reminding us that it doesn't always end happily ever after. Bringing a movie out of a book is never an easy task, especially not when it's an amazing book like this. Due to this fact I arrived at the theater with some skepticism and concerns. 20 minutes into the movie those thoughts were completely blown away, replaced with only good ones. My reason? The cast. Apart from the mother, who wasn't the mother I had gotten to know in the book, the cast was impeccable. Shailene Woodley, Ansel Elgort, Nat Wolff, Willem Dafoe(even though I'm not a fan in general) all made this movie into what it is. This combined with a fantastic score, and some absolutely beautiful scenes took this movie to different heights than I was able to predict. Astonishing. Making this movie better than the book was a mission impossible, but they sure made a noble attempt. One last shoutout goes to Shailene Woodley who was able to capture the character I grew so fond of in the book perfectly. I rarely use the word perfection but it certainly fits the bill in this particular scenario. To me Shailene, you are Hazel Grace Lancaster.",9.0,erik-anderssons94,2014/05/29,20,9
1050,October Sky,Movie that touches your heart and brings tears in your eyes,"I am not someone who writes reviews about movies, but then this is my first experience as I couldn't stop myself writing about October Sky. This movie is very close to my heart as it touches every aspect of our lives – aspiration, family, friends and most of all hope. I guess I have now lost the count of me viewing of this movie and trust me every single time I watch it , my heart feels good and my eyes have tears. The most beautiful part of the movie is the father-son relationship. Like Homer, I have grown up watching my dad as my Hero and always wanted to be someone like him, but could never muster the courage to tell him what he means to me. The other thing I love about this movie is the persistence by which one should follow his heart. Watch it with your family and friends and celebrate life in the way it should be. Show it to your kids, for the values it carries. Sad we do not get to see such stuff these days. Rare gem that is not found these days.",10.0,avinash-sirsath1980,2016/11/03,1,1
1051,Horrible Bosses 2,An unnecessary but funny sequel,"Hollywood's strategy of wringing every last ounce of life out of a successful idea via sequels, prequels, spin-offs and the ""partification"" of films has been discussed to death. At this point I'm almost as tired of having that discussion as I am seeing the subject at hand play out in real life, over and over again. It is with this mindset that, upon seeing the trailer for Horrible Bosses 2 for the first time, I loudly sighed in my theater seat and thought to myself, ""Why the hell are they doing this?"" And despite the actual answer being EASY MONEY, after actually seeing Horrible Bosses 2, I can honestly make a case that maybe – just maybe – these people actually wanted to get together again and make a funny movie for the sake of comedy. Exhibit A: The jokes are solid and, in most cases, funnier than the first film's. Part of that is a result of just letting a joke breathe and flourish naturally via timing and delivery. One gag in particular regarding the use of walkie-talkies nearly made me choke on my popcorn specifically because of how well it was executed through dialog alone. The first Horrible Bosses was more comparable to The Hangover films in that a group of white guys get in over their head and endure insane circumstances, each one more outlandish than the one before it. This time around, while we're still very much in the Hangover spirit of storytelling (I use that term in the loosest of senses), the film is much more reliant upon the comedic chemistry between our three leading men. That leads me to Exhibit B: This cast is simply fantastic. Reprising their roles as Nick (Jason Bateman) the straight man, Kurt (Jason Sudeikis) the womanizer, and Dale (Charlie Day) the fool, the three stars of this film bounce lines off one another like bumper cars to increasingly hilarious effect. Bateman shines brightest and that speaks volumes on his talent considering he's been playing variations of this role for nearly his entire career without the shtick showing any signs of wear – at least as far as this film is concerned. Sudeikis and Day get to play human cartoon characters the entire film and it simply just works. Also back is Jamie Foxx as the criminal consigliere, ""Motherf***er Jones."" While this character did nothing for me the first go-round, this time I find myself enjoying his dimwitted power plays and Big Gulp inflected sit- downs. Jennifer Aniston also returns as her sex-addicted dentist from the first film and gets to appear in the funniest scene of Horrible Bosses 2. Newcomers Chris Pine and Christoph Waltz also bring a welcome exaggerated Big Business brass ballsiness element to the film's central plot that just makes the story that much more relevant. Speaking of the plot Exhibit C: This story is conducive to comedy as well as being socially relevant. Nick, Kurt and Dale have created a product that Christoph Waltz agrees to help manufacture. Once the order has been completed, Waltz's character then cancels the order in a strategy that will allow him to purchase the product at pennies on the dollar once our three heroes have to claim bankruptcy. In a climate where we are mistrusting of the unscrupulous 1%, this plot has a sort of resonance that hits home with modern movie goers. I'm also fairly certain that more folks can relate to being screwed over by their boss (or the boss's conniving underling) than they can to their mega-hot co-worker trying to seduce them against their will. Basically, this film corrects every issue I had with the first one in that it unifies the protagonists motivations with the audience's desire for them to stick it to the man. It reaches across the aisle and finds a middle ground we can all agree on – and then it amps it up to mach speed by way of kidnap, hostage taking and much worse. With all this praise you might think I'm ready to call this a modern comedy classic. I'm not. Horrible Bosses 2 has problems. It's not shy to rely on gross-out gags, it has no shame in reprising jokes from the first film (albeit sparingly so), and it might as well have been directed by Apple CEO Tim Cook because, as Erik Walkuski of ScreenCrush noted in a tweet, Horrible Bosses 2 looks like it was filmed on an iPhone. That is to say there is no personality to the look of the film. It just is. While that's not a major concern for a comedy, it does leave a bit to be desired in the aesthetics department. I present my case that Horrible Bosses 2 is a win for everyone. Hollywood will make a nice payday while being able to say, ""See! People want more of the same"" without a hint of irony to be found. Audiences will get to laugh for a straight 110 minutes in the company of characters they already know they like spending time with based on the success of the first film. And although this could mean ""more of the same"" is all we're ever going to get, I'd like to put a positive spin on things and hope that maybe someone behind the scenes is paying attention. Maybe, just maybe, someone will pick up on the fact that this film is better than the first because it's actually just better in every sense of the word. Probably not though. *a football hits me in the groin and a laugh track explodes from an unknown dimension*",7.0,jeffdrollins,2014/12/19,47,28
1052,The Chorus,Entertaining feel-good French movie,"""The Chorus"" is an entertaining, rather sentimental movie. The theme of a new character coming to a school and turning the life of the children around isn't original but it is dealt with well here. A famous conductor's mother dies. He returns to France for the funeral and memories of his childhood come flooding back when an old school pal comes to visit. We then go back in time to see Clement Mathieu (Gérard Jugnot ) starting work at a remote boarding school for troublesome boys. The headmaster thinks that harsh discipline is the only way to keep control of the school. Naturally the new employee thinks differently and through his own love of music he tries to make the kids lives a bit better. The film is beautifully shot, using the countryside and the old building that serves as the school to give us a feeling of the enclosed world of the boys. The sets and costumes are also excellent in giving us the sense of the era the film is set. The child actors are very good and the script does well to develop a lot of the boy's characters rather than just concentrating on one or two. The ending might be too sweet for some people's liking. If it were a Hollywood movie there would probably be howls of derision that it wasn't gritty enough. However it is in keeping with the sentimental theme going through the movie.",7.0,paudie,2010/04/08,0,0
1053,Crash,A tale told by an idiot.,"The film's tagline is ""You think you know who you are. You have no idea."" I reject both the suggested idea that I have no idea who I am and the inferred suggestion that this film tells me who people truly are. If people in real life are really like this, then man, we're screwed. A bilious film that I walked into late and left prematurely. A film which is so wrapped up in its goal of becoming The Race Film of All Time that it loses sight of the very tools a film must use. The rules of Hollywood are such: if you show something in the first half, it must be used in the second half. Thus the gun that the daughter worries about her father buying will somehow find its way into the story in the second half. The rules of Hollywood are to make dialog 'real' - a concept which changes with every decade. Is this 'real dialog' somehow less ludicrous than the 'real dialog' of Kevin Smith ten years ago? The rules of Hollywood state that we set the scene, and as action rises, the camera moves in closer to the faces - in this film primarily so we can see the supposed shame, humiliation and transcendental realism of the characters. The strings increase, the frame-rate slows down, and our heart is meant to break. This film is as crassly manipulative as it is vapid. I have my own prejudices against L.A., which I freely admit, so to combat this prejudice I will not say that this is a natural situation stemming from the location, but rather probably from the author and director. The writer, Paul Haggis, already showed a taste for polemics over humanity in his Million Dollar Baby, which at least had a director who understood how to make the vision of the film bring out the best of a script's ideas. Now that Paul Haggis has his own hands on the camera it becomes obvious that not only does he not know how to write true, natural human drama, he does not know how to photograph or direct it as well. Paul Haggis comes from the land of TV, let us not forget: the land of diminished expectations. Everything is as obvious as a TV-movie, simply presented for simple minds - Haggis drills into us, over and over again, that while on the surface people may seem to be awful, they have secret pains hidden. This is a nice idea, but so hamfistedly presented that the whole juxtaposition of bad/good has an amateurish feel. Structurally the film is broken up, in the tradition of Magnolia and other earlier films. The editing is as typical and conventionally ""cinematic"" as could be - if there is a dramatic movement, such as a door opening or a car driving past between the subject and camera, the editors use that extreme movement to give the cut that occurs there a more kinetic quality. The problem is that other than the drive to keep things moving, there is very little intelligence and thought behind the cuts - everything is kept by the books. Not only are the puppets of this hideous racial punch and judy show ineptly handled, but even the curtains are lowered and raised with incompetence. The film tries desperately to present reality, but there's just no talent whatsoever. Some of the actors are good, some of the actors are bad, and all of the performance get muddied together, brought down by the low, low aesthetics of the film. We have cinematography which is technically clear: we can see the scene, we have a clear understanding of what is happening. However, not only is the cinematography unremarkable, but it is thoughtless camera-work and framing which believes that it actually is inspired. The result is little stylistic flourishes which one recognizes but do not actually add anything to the drama or pathos. For example - and this is a spoiler - as a father holds his dying child (the father might be shot too, I didn't stick around to find out) the camera sees his face and gives us the famous Vertigo track/zoom. The Vertigo shot!!! It was at this point that the film became hysterical and I just had to leave. I had to leave because it was so bad. I left because I was in the middle of a crowded theater, and I wanted to express to the audience that I was sick of emptyheaded Hollywood 'art' which is full of sound and fury, yet signifying nothing (in the Bard's own words). I hate to waste such good Shakespearian references on something this remarkably bad.",1.0,monolith94,2005/09/02,726,410

He never gets out of his little yellow car. Which means that nothing happens in the film. He just drives around talking to himself. I've never seen anything quite like it, and hope to never do again. Films like this should carry warnings about the levels of driving so people can avoid them. The music is boring too. It's the same song played over and over and I just don't get it.

In all fairness, I did find the acting in this moving (particularly from hazel) quite good. Her pain when gus dies is quite convincing.

It is a very important part of the movie, because some scenes take place in space, and Noland just found the right way to use sound. The soundtrack (made by the great Hans Zimmer) is breathtaking, epic, amazing, unreal. I could find a lot more adjectives to qualify it, but you have to hear it to understand how epic they are. you think how loud this film is you think you ware a astronaut Matthew, In this movie... Well, he is the movie. he orchestrates this film that everybody else feeds of his power so much that everyone around him gets better. But Matthew is just what was needed to feel the human part of the story (which is very important in Interstellar). He is capable of making us feel so many different emotions all along the story, as a father, as a human. Anne Hathaway was very convincing, all together the actors managed to create some harmony, which makes the human interactions credible. Caine, Chastaing and Affleck are a perfect choice. And then there is... The special guest who is mischievous in a minor role , is actually much more important than that. He proves, once again, that he is a great actor. Watch and see. and a sarcastic computer really a bit bizarre in space but this computer does come in handy in a important scene And finally, the scenario/story. I won't spoil anything here; I'll just try to convince you how great it is. Nolan is known to revolutionize everything when he tries a new genre in cinema. Well, once again he did it. With The Dark Knight he revolutionized the superhero genre. With Interstellar he's revolutionizing the sci-fi genre in cinema. he worked with a physicist in gravitational physics and astrophysics to help him with this movie. And we can feel and see just as Spielberg did in the 80s Nolan is doing it now Today, Nolan is laying the new foundations of the genre in cinema, proving that cinema is still at the beginning of what can be done (brace yourselves my friends, we have not seen anything yet). Why? Well, simply because we only know a few things about space, some things can't be proved for the moment, so we can use theory, and make the best of it. That is exactly what Nolan did. He used theories that exist today, and made a movie about mankind, about pioneers, about humanity, about us. whole journey that they thought was fraught with danger and the unknown as they have received messages from across time and space to realize that they had the answers after all it was just his daughter love to figure out what the lead scientist life work (Michael Caine) was about My rating for this movie can only be a 10,this film does not feel like 3hrs of moving space enthralling epic masterpiece with a beating heart of love and time and bending space time from a to b to meet his family across the universe This is the sci-fi movie of the decade, and probably the best movie Nolan ever made.if you like thinking about logic you might just come way thinking that this earth can be saved if we take what Nolan was taking about and not just taking the earth for granted Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night...

1058,Intermission,Over-rated Crap,"How Irish critics rave about this movie is beyond me. Overacted by the usual band of Irish actors dragged out for every Irish movie. Terrible script, with forced character quirks (the brown sauce). Romanticising all that is bad about Dublin. The attitude of 'ah, it's a dump but sure isnt it great all the same'. Plenty of tidbits purely for American audiences (the supermarket boss and his horribly forced catchphrase). And the nail in the coffin was Colm Meaney's character. A great actor forced to play this part that could've been written by a five year old. Cringeworthy stuff. The best thing about this movie is Farrell, and it's a bad when you have to say that. Well, at least he wasnt putting on his dreadful American accent. International Audiences be warned: stay at home and watch Snatch and Lock Stock. You'll have a better time.

1059,The Wailing,Another horror masterpiece from South Korea,"I want to start this review with saying that I am not completely against jump scares. They play integral part of horror movies, but when a movie mostly relies on them and is not supported with great story, I am always left displeased. What makes The Wailing so special is that there are almost no jump scares at all in this film. Instead, we, the viewers, are taken through a story rich with mystery, great characters and their struggles, dark atmosphere with well designed and amazingly crafted horror scenes that make your blood run cold. Also, in addition the movie carries a great subtext left for the viewer to question, find evidence and interpret it. You can feel that the director took some time and did some research to give us as much real horror experience as possible. One might find The Wailing a bit boring because the film is a slow burner and not constructed as most of modern horror films, or might find the film too long (running time 2h 36min) but if you are patient man it will pay off by the end. Who says that the horror genre is dead. You just have to look beyond those cash grab mainstream horror films with wide releases and you might find some hidden gems.",9.0,SilentEyes_,2016/09/15,183,142

Some would want him expelled, others want him for Class President. On this extremely eventful day, the audience is invited to follow Ferris, his best pal and his girlfriend from morning to afternoon (when they all should have been in school), enjoying a holiday declared by the resourceful Ferris Bueller. They get to speed on the freeway in a Ferrari, sing ""Danke Schoen"" on an Octoberfest Float, eat at the most exclusive restaurant in town and always keep just one step ahead of a furious principal in hot pursuit. With fake computer grade and attendance records, Ferris has it made. The scene where the principal hitches a ride on a school bus after having been ""torn up"" by Doberman watch dogs is worth the ticket price (Oh Yeah!).

1063,The Green Mile,A soon to be classic movie.,"The Green Mile was definitely one of the best movies of the year. With the character driven storyline, all of the characters played well, to the mix of joy, laughter and sadness. This is one of those movies where every single actor puts their all into their craft. It was interesting that this was taken from a book that Steven king wrote being that it seems he writes a lot of horror and thriller books. I did not get a chance to read the book but i have heard it is almost perfectly taken from the book with just a few parts taken out that didn't improve the movie. Some people have complained that it was too long around 3 hours but i believe that is what made it even better. the way the story flowed and the skills of the actors the movie did not feel like it was slow and dragged on. The movie wasn't about the friendships on the green mile but it was more of a miracle of a man and the people he effects. When Michael Clarke Duncan's character gets convicted of a crime and is placed on the green mile everyone is in awe of not just his size but how humble and mild mannered he is. When a few miraculous events take place the guards start to think he has magical powers gifted to him from god. With all the things the happened and his attitude the guards start to doubt that he did the crime he has been convicted of. The message I got from this was that there is clear that there is injustice and the miracles can happen in the unexpected of places. One thing I also noticed was the depiction of the relationship of the guards and inmates. They all seemed like friends they seem to have been treated with respect and dignity and because of that they seemed to not have as many problems that you may have in other prisons. Weather that was because of the beliefs of King or the director or both that we should treat our prisoners better so that they don't end up back in prison and not as violent while they are in it. This film will get you to think about its subjects and gradually build on you. This will be a movie that will be hard to forget even after the credits have ended.",10.0,Deanjones1970,2012/11/14,7,4
1064,Ferris Bueller's Day Off,"Hate Ferris, Love the Movie","I went to see this movie in the theatre with my sister, and we cracked up! I just loved the classic ""School-Itis"" scene in the beginning and the love/hate between Ferris and his sister Jeannie! She knew he was faking but he totally fooled his parents! And then he winks at Jeannie and she gives him one of her hate-filled stares (which she did all through the movie,) and her expressions were just so evocative! She was GREAT in this movie! (And I've always had a thing for JG!) Her classic lines: ""I KNEW IT! OHHHHHH!"" when she finds Ferris' dummy under the covers in his bed - ""And if you say Ferris Bueller you lose a testicle!"" to Charlie Sheen in the police station - ""My name is Jeannie but guys call me Shauna"" - the same ""You don't have to live with the little trouser-snake!"" But I have to confess that I really despise Ferris. He thinks he's so funny, but he's nothing but a selfish little boy. He doesn't give a damn about anything but his own pleasure. Just look at the way he treated Cameron. He didn't give a POOP if Cameron was really sick, or if Ed Rooney caught Cameron ditching and he got in trouble for that, or much worse for a phony phone call, or if Cameron's old man beat the s**t out of him for taking the Ferrari, or anything else - he just manipulated and shamed and bullied Cameron until he got what he wanted. Then he burned rubber out of the school parking lot, he took his hands off the wheel a lot while driving, and then he left that priceless car with those two dirt-bags! Then he under-loaded the engine trying to run the speedometer back for 150 miles (which won't work on a Smiths-Jaeger speedometer-it's made to defeat that.) And he called Cameron's Subaru ""a piece of s**t."" You know, Sloane could do better than Ferris. I really hated the little b@st@ard! Poor Ed Rooney! I liked Grace, though! She was funny, especially her accent. I'm from Minnesota and the Chicago accent is really quite similar, and she did it perfectly. Classic Grace lines: ""Sluts, dweebs, jocks, motor-heads, they all love him. He's a Righteous Dude!"" (which she pronounced 'doooooooode,"" which cracked me up!) ""Peterson home on Line 2 - and watch your mouth this time!"" ""Oh, Ed! You sound just like Dirty Harry!"" Ed says ""Ferris Bueller's behind this, I know it! And now he's got Sloane Peterson involved in it."" and she says: ""And her grandmother, too."" Not to mention how she put down Jeannie when she got a little smart-mouthed. And now we come to Mia Sara... smoking hot is the best way to describe her. Dude, there are all kinds of nude pictures of her on the web and I've downloaded every single one of them. Like Beavis said: ""Boingoingoingoingoingoing!!!!"" How could a geek like Ferris land a girlfriend like that? Only by being a consummate bull-s**tter... It really cracked me up when the school nurse walked into the classroom and Sloane starts putting on her jacket (which was really ugly, by the way) and grabbing her purse EVEN BEFORE the teacher said anything! She knew! You know, the girl's clothes in the '80s were a lot more modest than the '70s. They looked better. Now - God! It's horrible! Classic Sloane Lines: Ferris says ""do you have a kiss for Daddy?"" and she says ""are you kidding"" (TOOOUUUUNNNNGGGGE!) and Ed Rooney is standing up there, just TOTALLY FREAKED OUT! Dude, I damn near died laughing! Bloopers: Every movie has at least one. When the dirt-bags are out seriously abusing the Ferrari, the speedometer they show is NOT the real one from the actual car. Ferris' parents supposedly didn't have the money to buy him a car, but between the synthesizer, the stereo and the computer, there's about $13,000 worth of electronics in his room (Back then, a car (like Jeannie's Fiero) was only about $9,000 (in 1986 prices.) So, it's a really fun movie and it'll go down in history as a classic, but I still say Ferris is a trouser-snake . . .",,borisratnik-1,2007/07/31,3,2
1065,Death of a Salesman,Very Well-Made Film Version of Classic,"How do you review a film of a play? Especially a play like Arthur Miller's ""Death of a Salesman?"" It's not easy, so for once in my life, I'll be brief. The play, is a classic, and I actually agree that it deserves to be regarded as such (unlike such dreadful works as Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness""). This film version is done on pretty obvious sets but not on a stage, and features an excellent cast, especially Dustin Hoffman and John Malkovich as Willy and Biff Loman. They are absolutely incredible in their roles. Totally immersed to the point where you forget that they are famous actors. They ARE Willy and Biff. Often plays-come-films are very wordy and too boringly filmed. Here the direction is pretty good; only static and flat in a few points, and Miller's dialogue is so haunting that you really don't notice. I had seen the play before and I was totally engrossed by this version when I watched it for a drama class. Very well made adaptation.",8.0,Mr. Pulse,2000/09/13,4,3
1066,October Sky,"A Movie Treasure Of A Time, Place, and A Young Dreamer","This is a movie that really nails a time in place in the American story. Coal was still king and the Cold War was in full swing. The American experience was diverse and things were moving ahead at a faster clip. No place was more unique than West Virginia. It was a place built on the blood, guts, and that black magic energy source. In a town named Coalwood we find a boy mesmerized by the Soviet satellite Sputnik. As the future of coal, due to the town's mine starting to give out, was anything but certain Homer Hickman, our young rocketeer, decided his future wasn't coal. It was rockets. This young boy was a classic dreamer whose blue-collar father thought was wasting time with this silly rocket idea. October Sky delivers oodles of Americana in a time of great change in the evolution of our country from industrial to technology. No one could imagine that technology would trump old industrial might and for a youngster dreaming of rockets it was an uphill climb. In Coalwood especially because this town's glory was rooted in a past history of producing coal and nothing else. Coal was Coalwood so the name is natural. There is a struggle not only in the town to keep up finding new coal reserves, but with the changing times forcing change. In this climate the young dreamer Homer was snake bit with his dream of rocketry. He wouldn't give in to any of the roadblocks and his own dad's insolence. In fact he began the arduous task of changing minds of which his dad's was the most pivotal. This movie really nails a historic time. It is a great human interest story that happens to be Homer Hickman's true story. This story is compelling and the movie gets the period, the town, and the nation's quick push into science and space down pat. Jake Gylenhaal delivers a fine performance projecting a fine career ahead of the young actor here. The bottom line is Homer Hickman represents a nations new paradigm and against all odds he achieves his dream. See this film because it's equally going to pull your heartstrings, stir prideful nostalgia, and tell the story of nation all in the guise of young boy. Excellent! I also recommend you read Homer Hickman's book Rocket Boys AKA October Sky.",8.0,AudioFileZ,2018/12/22,2,2
1067,Intermission,a bad movie,"This was no Trainspotting or Guy Ritchie film. It was a big wannabee. It wanted to be an edgy, nervous-laughter, urban-life affirming film, but it's more of a camera jerky, mess. It's a lot easier to imitate something else, than to create a real story with real characters. From the beginning, I couldn't care less about the characters or what they were involved in. They were always always hitting, pissing, or crying on each other. Only, there wasn't any substance to what they were doing. The dialog between characters is meant to be hip, revealing, instead it comes out trite, and one scene after another is predictable. I know there are viewers out there that really liked this movie, so I could be wrong.",3.0,axelswag,2005/08/14,22,12
1068,Moon,"Good idea, had potential, but is too dry and barren to enjoy","I see an idea in Moon, but I don't see a motion picture. This character driven sci-fi/drama which explores being human feels too cold, bland and overlong to work. It takes a while to make its point, and relies on our identification with a character who is portrayed with confused acting. The last time Sam Rockwell was in space was in Galaxy Quest. There he was a scream, here he is a yawn. Moon (I suppose) works in small chunks but the big picture feels dull and not very enriching. Sam Bell, for three years, has been running an energy station on the moon. The energy harvested there supplies an environmentally friendly Earth in the near future. Sam's only companion is the station's computer, Gerty (a more mobile version of HAL 9000, with a smiley face). One day/night, Sam is investigating a wrecked harvesting machine, and inside he discovers a body.... another Sam. What does this mean? Is Sam #1 going crazy from being on the moon for too long? Is Sam #2 a clone? Is Sam #1 a clone? Are there any more bodies out there? and whose side is Gerty gonna take? Moon probably sounded good as a pitch, considering all the questions that come up once you block out the plot. Unfortunately the movie never really comes alive. The ending is the most exiting part, but ten minutes of solidity doesn't necessary warrant a time investment in eighty minutes of ponderous direction. Moon is tricky to recommend.",5.0,Samiam3,2010/11/29,111,62
1069,Primal Fear,Watchable and Exciting Thriller,"When Richard Rushman, the Archbishop of Chicago, is brutally murdered, Martin Vail, one of the city's leading criminal lawyers takes on the task of defending the only suspect, an altar boy named Aaron Stampler. There are, however, some strange features about the case. Rushman was a highly popular individual, and Stampler appears to have had no motive for the crime. Indeed, Rushman showed the young man great kindness, saving him from a life of destitution on the streets. Stampler is put on trial, but as the case progresses disturbing facts start to come to light. There are hints that the late Archbishop may have been involved in sexual, financial and political corruption, and Vail starts to doubt both his client's sanity and his innocence. (The film has gained in topicality since 1996 as more scandals involving paedophile priests have come to light). Recent years have seen a large number of courtroom thrillers, but this is one of the better ones. Richard Gere gives a good performance as Vail. His voice is sometimes too soft, making his words indistinct (a common failing with this particular actor), but he is well able to convey the two sides of Vail's character's, his smooth plausibility and his arrogance. Vail is a brilliant but conceited lawyer, convinced that he is the only man who can save Stampler from the death penalty. (The film was made before Illinois introduced a moratorium on the use of capital punishment). There is another good contribution from Laura Linney (an excellent but often underrated actress) who plays Janet Venable, Counsel for the prosecution. In a plot development typical of this sort of thriller, she turns out to be Vail's ex-girlfriend, now determined to prove herself a better lawyer than her former lover. (Don't the American Bar Association have rules to prevent this sort of conflict of interests from arising?) I was already familiar with, and admired, Edward Norton's work in films such as ""Fight Club"" and ""Kingdom of Heaven"". Here he plays the part of Stampler (his first movie role) and gives what is probably the best acting performance in the film. Stampler has two distinct sides to his personality. On the one hand he is normally a quiet, inoffensive young man, shy, stammering and inarticulate. On the other, when under stress he can be assertive to the point of aggressiveness and rudeness, speaking loudly without any hint of a stammer. It is never clear which of these personalities is his ""real"" one, and the possibility is raised that he might be suffering from multiple personality disorder, which in turn raises questions about his accountability for his actions. The scenes in which Stampler suddenly switches between one personality and another are brilliantly executed; Norton brings out the contrasts between the mild ""Aaron"" and the aggressive ""Roy"" so starkly that one might think that two different actors were playing the two different personalities. Some of the plot developments seem rather implausible; in Britain it would be perfectly possible for a defendant to change his plea from a simple ""not guilty"" to ""not guilty by reason of insanity"" if new evidence about his mental state came to light after the trial had begun, and I can see no reason why things should be any different in another common-law jurisdiction such as the United States. On the whole, however, this is a very watchable and exciting thriller. Even the sudden twist at the end (I won't say what that is) does not spoil the film, as such twists sometimes do. 7/10",7.0,JamesHitchcock,2005/12/07,6,5
1070,Hotel Transylvania,Pretty Lame,"In the last couple of decades Pixar has raised the bar so high for animated movies, that even if a perfectly fine animated movie comes along, we end up feeling underwhelmed by it. That's precisely the case with Hotel Transylvania. Hotel Transylvania tells the story of modern day Dracula, voiced by Adam Sandler, who runs a hotel away from human world meant only for monsters. When the whole monster world – including all type of zombies, werewolfs, mummies, and Frankenstein, comes to his hotel to celebrate the birthday of Dracula's daughter's 118th birthday, a human boy discovers the hotel and falls in love with his daughter. Though it was fun to watch the whole monster world assemble under one room, but soon the proceedings get reduced to silly jokes which would make only 12 year olds laugh. I kept thinking about The Cabin in the Woods throughout the movie, where all different kind of monsters are assembled and thought even if some part of that innovation was applied in this movie, this would have been eminently watchable. The only person who could make some kind of an impact through his voice was Adam Sandler, who did a nice impersonation of Dracula's voice. But even that was unfunny after some time. But looking at his standards, I guess this was the best movie Adam Sandler would have done after Punch Drunk Love. Andy Samberg as Jonathan, the boy who discovers the hotel, is irritating, and Selena Gomez as Dracula's daughter is nothing to write about. It's a shame to see that there is already a sequel planned for this lame movie. I just hope that the sequel goes the Madagascar way and not the Ice Age and Shrek way.

A new warden, Clément Mattieu, (Gérard Jugnot) arrives at an ""internat"", what is to all extent and purposes a borstal, to find boys out of control and a sadistic head (jean-Paul Bonnaire). Clément begins a choir and small changes begin... ""Les Choristes"" is a marvel - here there is little posing and much poise - all the parts are well done, especially Jugnot and the children. they seem to have gathered the most natural group of children I have seen in a long time. Their acting reminded me of Danny Boyle's Millions - though that is a modern fable it has much the same effect - but ""Les Choristes"" has not one dud scene it. The time flies by watching this - as things get desperate then better. Of course, the music is wonderful, and the part of Pierre Mohange (jean-Baptiste Maunier) is beautifully played. The pacing is perfection, nothing is rushed, and we are left to understand the utter misery as well as the joy here for all along the way - it is not a fairytale - though it does lift the soul wonderfully by its end This is only director Christophe Barratier's second feature film and is extremely impressive on that basis.

Yes it was edited well, and yes they are very obviously making a point against SeaWorld, but that aside you can't deny the facts... the facts that SeaWorld try to warp to suit their own points/pockets/whatever. After the film I did some researching of my own on the internet, just to make sure I hadn't been suckered in to believing untruths... the bottom line is Orcas, and any other animal or marine mammal, need to live in the wild, and plucking them from their natural habitat is the reason why Tilikum and other poor SeaWorld 'puppets' behave the way they do. I highly recommend this film, if nothing else but to open people's horizons a little more and really make them think about whether they want to be supporting these multi-billion dollar companies, whose main aim at the end of the day is to fill their own pockets, at whatever expense to our precious animal kingdom.",9.0,danielleemmaking,2015/01/13,10,9
1075,Death of a Salesman,Stagey but oddly compelling version of Miller's play (spoilers),"Arthur Miller's ""Death of A Salesman"" has been hailed as one of the all-time great American plays. Through the character and family of Willy Loman, Miller's text effectively butchers the American dream, the idea that if you work very hard at whatever you do you will become a success. This film version of the play can't seem to decide whether it wants to be a film, or a filmed stage performance. Fortunately, through some solid performances, it overcomes this potentially debilitating flaw to deliver a moving and thought-provoking drama. Willy Loman (Dustin Hoffman) is a man living in the past. Deny it though he might, his life has become a failure. He is trapped in a staid, illusory relationship with his wife Linda (Kate Reid), his two sons Biff (John Malkovich) and Happy (Stephen Lang) are hopeless drifters, and the company he has worked for for thirty-six years decides to throw him on the scrapheap. All the hopes and high ideals he had for his family have gone to dust. Realizing this, Willy enters a personal decline which can only end in tragedy... The film's sets nearly kill the picture. It is apparent right from the first shot that the movie has been filmed entirely on a soundstage. This is disappointing, as the story could have done without this and benefited from a truly cinematic adaptation. Things do improve technically, however. There is some wonderful lensing between Willy's random flashbacks (which show how his life has disintegrated) and the present day. If the entire film had been like this, it would have raised the standard from a good film to an excellent film. In nearly every scene, Dustin Hoffman takes centre-stage as Willy Loman. Using a lot of nervous tics and nuances (present in so many of his roles), Hoffman deftly charts Loman's self-realization and eventual demise. John Malkovich is a picture of soured idealism as his eldest son Biff, and Kate Reid captures the despairing, misplaced loyalty of Willy's long-suffering wife. In other roles, Jon Polito is on good form is Willy's much younger boss, as is Louis Zorich as his brother Ben (Willy's complete opposite - a strong-willed, charismatic, successful entrepreneur). The play is depressingly honest, in a thought-provoking way. There are many Willy Lomans out there, making the wrong choices, trying to live (through blind faith or ignorance) up to false or unrealistic ideals and impressing the consequences of those choices and ideals on those around them. This is a very universal and identifiable situation, and the principal reason the play has become so popular. This film manages to capture that, but not quite in a wholly cinematic way. It remains a stagey but still compelling version of this timeless classic play.",,alainenglish,2004/05/25,6,4

A very important message which I think the film delivers brilliantly, with John Coffey as a ""triumphant card"". The supernatural effects in the movie might be unbelievable if you focus solely on them, but I think they're ""metaphoring"" and make things a bit more understandable, maybe. A wonderful movie that moves at a measured pace on to a very unexpected ending. As with most great movies the casting is almost perfect and each character gives added depth to a rich script.

From what I saw, virtually all of the characters are low kinds of scum, always willing to betray one another and murder for kicks. The protagonist, played by Ray Liota, lacks the depth or redeeming characteristics that Cagney and Al Pacino's gangsters had. Liota's Henry Hill has very little that would make him seem like somebody to care about, because he's always willing to betray people and lie to save his own skin. When he gets his comeuppance, the viewer knows he richly deserves it, and will find no reason to take his side. His colleagues in crime, played by Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, are equally irredeemable. The only decent qualities about De Niro and Liota is that they are not quick to condone random murder, as Pesci is always apt to do. The level of violence in this movie is gratuitous and disgusting. It does little to glamorize the life of crooks, and instead makes it seem like a low, loathsome venture. This movie is full of violence and little in the way of decent themes, as virtually all the characters are too slimy to convey anything relatable to the viewer on a basic level, except that we sometimes betray others to save ourselves. The acting is decent, though not something to write home about. The plot is winding and tortuous, so pay very close attention if you want to understand the action. The plot actually seems secondary, more like a framework for a menagerie of blood-and-guts and gangster dialogue. I do enjoy movies that feature prominent ultra-violence, like ""Robocop"" and ""Sin City,"" but those movies had deep characters and themes about morality that this movie does not explore. Watch it if you wish, but don't expect this to be the classic everyone seems to think it is. PS: Listen for the phrase ""you're busting my balls."" Virtually all the main characters say it. You could play a drinking game with this movie for all the times the characters say that phrase. This likely inspired a scene in the TV series ""South Park,"" where Cartman says this phrase to people who refuse his offer to buy aborted fetuses. Good times.",4.0,michael_the_nermal,2006/06/13,66,27
1079,Death of a Salesman,Just to be liked,"A generation after Lee J. Cobb originated the role on stage and Fredric March did the big screen version, Dustin Hoffman does a really great job as Willy Loman in Death Of A Salesman in a made for television version. It's a bit more surreal than the others but Arthur Miller's message about misplaced values certainly gets across. All poor Willy Loman wanted to be was be liked and that to him became a creed. It's how you sell your product, it's how you sell yourself. He loved his family, but he was always 'on'. And forever envious of brother Ben who went out and took risks but saw the world. Hoffman was years younger than March or Cobb, but with makeup he certainly looks the part. Kate Reid plays the wife and John Malkovich and Stephen Lang are sons Biff and Hap. They really function well as the Loman family unit and the chemistry is real. Seeing how much purchasing is now done on line, I wonder if a lot of the message of Death Of A Salesman will be lost in the future. An audience in the future might not know what a salesman is or does as personal contact in buying and selling becomes less and less. I certainly hope not.",7.0,bkoganbing,2019/01/20,0,0

Being an avid book reader, I'm always skeptical about watching the words of my favorite books transformed and materialized on the big screen... but TFIOS stayed true to the book. The movie was absolutely lovely from beginning to end. The young actors were great. The comedy hit on all the right notes, the romance made your heart smile and the tragedy pulled at your heart strings. It really was a wonderful adaptation, and I believe it stayed as true to the book as possible without many changes where there were any. The minute it was over, I wanted to watch it again. Upon leaving the theater, I looked around and there was not one dry eye. Not even the men. If you are a big fan of the book, like myself... and are skeptical about whether this stays true. Don't be.

The first movie was good enough, but not something extraordinary, and yet they decided to make a second one. The plot is good, and the come backs are okay, but the movie is simply not funny. They did try to repeat some of the jokes from the first movie, and the three main characters are the same, but the movie is more like an action movie than a comedy. The twist in the end was good, but the train scene was unnecessary too long that gets boring. I guess the action wasn't that bad and the performances were okay.

1082,Crash,Such A Fine Line Between Oscar and Lifetime Channel Movie...,"While this film was well done, I am stunned at both the average voter rating on IMDb and it earning the Best Film for 2005. This is a 'tidy' account of racial conditions in the USA, but no more cutting edge than the content found in any 'All In The Family' sitcom from the 70s. There is little character development, with each being one-dimensional regarding their personal discriminations. If this film is supposed to deliver a message, it was lost in my viewing. It appeared that every character's racial subjectivity was influenced and primarily based on the most recent event with that race. In my opinion, racial conditions have improved and evolved in our country further than this film suggests. Personal discriminations in the film are not subtle and are stereotypical to a fault. It was void of subtleties and wit that truly represent an individual's approach and reaction in real life. Comparing this to the other nominees this year, I wonder what criteria the voters based their vote upon to select Crash as the winner. This would be a 'surf-through' movie if you passed over it on the Lifetime Channel (only A-list cameo appearances save it from this deserved placement). This is a 'one-watch' movie and will likely date itself quickly. I am sure the idea for the film came out of a graduate student's thesis and would work well in stage form with an ethnic cross-section of serious undergraduate drama majors.",6.0,BobM-08731,2006/03/19,203,109
1083,Blackfish,New reasoning tools,"This has already sparked a debate, a good thing. Viewers are split between those who use the case of a killing orca as argument against animal captivity, much less for corporate profit, and those who like to point holes in the emotional or scientific appeal of the argument to avoid having to find a real issue. I side with the first but with some reservations which I'm going to elaborate on. See, a film like this is a great opportunity, starting from the issue at hand, the issue could be anything, to re-examine our whole reasoning tools we use to approach things. So how apt that at the center of the debate is an attempt, on both sides, to surmise how a living thing reasoned about things. We have this whale that killed not once or twice, but three times. Suits tried to shush the whole thing because there's money at stake, it's what they always do. But was it accident or deliberation? Is it in the nature of the animal to kill or did it go 'mad' by conditions? We see a video of another orca who grabs a trainer by the foot and won't let go, eventually breaking both her arm and leg. Moments earlier she was petting the animal by the pool. This one thankfully survived, though it's just as likely that she wouldn't. We see another video of another orca who grabs a trainer by the foot and sinks him down with her, keeps him for a few minutes then comes up for air, repeating two or three times, nearly killing the poor guy. He was an experienced scuba diver so managed his breaths and kept his cool. Eventually the animal let go, though again this was chance. It's all as simple as this. Speaking of 'psychosis' caused by the circumstances confers the illusion of an acquired 'illness'. Speaking about 'violent genes' again makes a muddle of things, though there's a recent study on mice that shows how fearful memories can pass down to a later generation. As groundbreaking as evolution if it's confirmed, but we don't have to go that far. I am never going to be a good painter or banker because I was implanted at birth with some gene of painting or banking. We have these videos of near-death accidents, as well as a very interesting report on the last death of a very experienced and cautious trainer. Apparently the animal could hear that the bucket of fish was nearing its end, made a full round of greeting with its fin for which it was not rewarded, its enthusiasm according to other trainers present waned at that point and in the next number she mangled her trainer. This after a long history of abusive confinement and inter-species aggression. Animals don't think, have no consciousness of self, but they have rich perceptual fields of understanding, often much richer than our own. We do have a cogito and yet give ourselves over to the most irrationally animal behavior, just do your round of pubs on a Saturday night. There is never going to be any precise science of how the interweaving of experience leads to a sudden fight about really nothing. In the video where an orca grabs the trainer's foot, she might as well have been toying with her. It's not easy to say exactly what caused each accident, but moreover it's really beside the point. The thing is, we don't have to base our whole reasoning approach on logical causation, and I don't need to know the precise physics involved in skiing to be able to ski. This shouldn't be an excuse to ignore the absurd confinement of large animals for daily shows, nor should it be a call to abandon any effort to cultivate a world in the name of naturalism. There must be a way that allows us to come into contact with the wonderful creatures that live next to us that doesn't ignore the fact they are soulful beings. The way we think and the way we act on things are linked, transforming one affects the other. What we see reveals enough: animals are neither pets nor things, the relationship can't be built on maximizing profits, our curiosity to learn and co-exist must come to terms with accident.

1084,Horrible Bosses 2,Horrible Bosses 2:The theatrical cut.,"After recently enjoying the first movie in the Horrible Bosses series,I was pleased to discover that a friend had recently picked up the sequel,which led to me getting ready to find out how horrible the bosses could be again. The plot: Wanting to become their own bosses, Nick Hendricks, Dale Arbus & Kurt Buckman invent a machine called a ""Shower Buddy"" and start searching round for an investor.Meeting the major father and son business team of Rex & Bert Hanson,the guys are left speechless,when the Hanson's order 1000s of their devices,with a promise of paying millions once the items are made. Thrilled to announce to their new business partners that they have made all of the stock (after borrowing $500,000 in order to set up a factory) Nick,Dale & Kurt discover that they have been betrayed,when the Buckman's reveal that they are going back on the deal,so that they can buy the stock and business up cheap when it goes bust.Up to their eyes in debt,the guys try to think up a way to pay off the debt.Reaching their wits end,the Nick,Dale and Kurt suddenly decide that the best way to pay off the debts is to get cash from Bert Hanson,by kidnapping his son Nick. View on the film: Kicking off with a hilarious innuendo scene,the screenplay by co- writer/(along with John Morris/Jonathan M. Goldstein/John Francis Daley & John Morris ) director Sean Anders runs the film into pitch black Comedy oil,which goes from physical comedy such as the guys going undercover for their kidnap attempt,to dry punch lines.such as Nick finding out that a group he has joined,is far from the AA group therapy that he imagined.Along with the sharp Comedy bite,the writers also show a real tightening of the bond between the team from the first one,with Nick,Dale & Kurt each playing their own part in the planning of the kidnap. Ripping up his good boy looks, Chris Pine gives a brilliant performance as Rex Hanson,thanks to Pine showing that behind Rex's good looks is a barking-made psychopath,who is not only a threat to the guys,but also to his own dad (played by a very good Christoph Waltz.) Ganging up again, Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikis and Charlie Day each give fantastic performances,with Day's frantic energy and Sudeikis excellent awkwardness being underpinned by Bateman's calm, collective manner,as Nick,Kurt & Dale find out how horrible a boss can be.",8.0,morrison-dylan-fan,2015/05/29,5,3

Disappointment because I wasted both time and money on this movie, and anger because so many viewers believe in such a contrived, unrealistic portrayal of characters and racism.

I figured that a highly acclaimed film with Robert Deniro couldn't be bad; I was wrong. The plot never seems to satisfy or even make sense. Why does he talk to the Secret Service guy? Why's he trying to kill Palantine? Why is he a hero for taking the law into his own hands? How does killing a few pimps bring him back his sanity, when the sleaze and filth he loathes is still all around him? And, really, what's with the mohawk? I really don't understand the hype with this movie. Poor script, poor cohesion, but maybe that's what you get with a psycho for a main character.

""Are you talking to me,"" One of the best lines ever? For what reason? I simply don't understand the hype, and believe me, unless you are a dimwitted individual, you will agree with me. I was also perplexed by why Jodie Foster was nominated for best supporting actress. She is hardly in the movie. Martin Scorsese may be one of the most overrated directors in the business.

The villain is fantastic, with solid motivation and who is vastly different from the hero, yet still connected to him! Harry gets even more development into turning to the new Goblin. The romance can be a bit of a pain in the gut but it's not bad and once again it perfectly shows Peters struggle. The effects are vastly better than the first and it has great fight scenes as well.

I watch most films from comedy to war, so i am not just being one dimensional. Plus i really liked the first one. I really am blaming the writer of this film rather than the acting, as once again Jason Bateman and Jennifer Aniston seemed as good as usual. From watching the film, with the filth talk from Jennifer Aniston it is obviously set for adults, and the first conversation was about her talking about gay male sex at 14. This i found extremely uncomfortable. But my main problem were Jason Batemans two friends. i can't recall them being so pathetically annoying in the first one. It was basically every time they said something. It was like they only had 1% of their brain working. They reminded me of the character in Home Alone played by Judge Reinhold as the daft robber (sticky fingers). But that was a U certificate aimed for kids, which was great. The part that made me turn it off was when they were all hiding in a house and wandering if the owner had gone, so they could quickly get out. So one of the brain dead friends just shouted his name about ten times. Luckily he wasn't in but Jason Bateman asked why would you do that, he could have been in? He simply said, Oh i never thought that far. I was basically getting embarrassed for the bloke who wrote this and just turned it off. Getting annoyed by his two friends from the minute it started is NOT enjoyment, and definitely NOT funny at all. There were quips just like the above one on a permanent basis that made you think, Oh dear.. Anyway that is my opinion, but i hope you enjoy it no matter what i think.",3.0,k_dawson,2014/12/14,39,18

Colm Meaney's maverick ""diry harry"" cop character has some of the best lines in the movie and Meaney plays the part fantastically. Colin Farrell as a psychopathic thug is alarmingly realistic.There are also strong performances from Shirley Henderson and Deirdre Kane.

I wont reveal much about the story but it is about the life of a loner Astronaut Saml Bell who is towards the end of this three year stint on the Moon.

1094,Primal Fear,Extremely underrated thriller; Not to be missed,"*****SPOILER ALERT***** I was surprised looking at the IMDb top 250 movies that ""Primal Fear"" isn't among them while the more elaborately made and overrated thriller ""The Usual Subjects"" is listed as #17 among the all time best in motion picture history. Both movies have narratives that build up to a shocking and surprising ending but the movie ""Primal Fear's"" ending fits right in with the story that it's presenting and doesn't take anything away from it. While at the same time when you see the movie again for any clues for the surprise ending as hard as you try you can't find them because the ending was, in the true sense of the word, a total surprise. ""Primal Fear"" is really one of those movies that has a good story that builds up the suspense level with acting and directing and delivers a shocking ending. The film climax not only stuns the audience but makes total sense and doesn't take away anything from the story that you saw up to that point when it hits you. Where as ""The Usual Suspects"" surprise ending seems totally contrived and completely negates the story that you were seeing up to the part that you were hit by it that the movie plot that you were watching becomes utterly senseless. Marty Vail, Richard Gere, is one of Chicago's top defense attorneys who likes to take on high-profile cases for a hefty fee or Pro-Bono as long as it gets him publicity and embellishes his already envious reputation. Marty also believes that everybody no matter how repulsive their crime, which there accused of deserves to be defended to the utmost of his ability. One morning in a bar watching the TV Vail sees a live news report of the police chasing down a young man who is reported to have murdered a very powerful and popular man from the Catholic Church Archbishop Richard Rushman, Stanley Anderson. Smelling publicity in defending that person, if he's not killed by the police or ends up killing himself, Vail uses his connections to get on the case defending him. At the jail-house talking to the young man Aaron Stampler, Edward Norton, he finds out that he's a 19 year-old altar boy at the church that the Archbishop was in charge of. Stampler tells him that he blacked out, lost time as he puts it, when he came into the Archbishops office when he heard that there was someone else there. Stampler blacked out but when he woke up from his unconscious state he found himself covered with blood and the Archbishop was dead! Seeing that he just panicked and ran. The state wants the death penalty for Stampler and assigned to prosecute the case Janet Venable, Laura Linney, who once had an affair with Marty Vail and is very surprised that Vail is handling the case for Stampler's defense. Before he's to go on trial when Stampler is examined by a defense paid psychiatrist Dr. Molly Arrington, Frances McDormand. It's then discovered that he has a split personality and is not in control of himself when his other self takes over his mind and he becomes ""Roy"", a completely different and violent person! Marty Vail later also finds this out the hard and brutal way about Stampler's condition by being banged around by ""Roy"". It's determined by Dr. Arrington that Sampler is a very sick person and should get help in a mental hospital not in a prison but since the trial is already on Vail can't change the plea from not guilty to innocent by reason of insanity. Vail later finds out that Stampler was sexually abused by the Archbishop by tracking down a video tape with the Archbishop having Stampler and other altar boys and girls engage in sexual activities while he watched. The tape would not only be very embarrassing to the church but to a lot of high powerful people in the city and state government if it were released. Vail sends a copy of the tape to the prosecutor, Miss. Venable, so it would force her to use it at the trial. At the trial State Prosecutor Venable has the tape played,to the total shock of those in the courtroom, to show that Stampler had cause and reason to murder the Archbishop. Just as Vail expected, by releasing the tape to Venable, the case starts to backfire against her. It's then when Vail puts Aaron Stampler on the stand to be cross-examined by Miss. Venable who aggressive and belligerently questions him on the archbishops murder he goes completely berserk. ""Roy"" takes over Aaron's mind and attacks Miss. Venable and almost ends up breaking her neck. Everybody decides, the Judge as well as the prosecution, that Stampler is insane and not responsible for his actions and drops the murder case against him. I's agreed that he needs to be in a mental hospital and not in a state prison ;but the story is not over for the movies shocking and surprising ending is just about to happen. One of the best crime/court dramas ever made with outstanding performances by, of course, Edward Norton, Richard Gere, Laura Linney and everyone else involved with the acting in the movie.

1095,The Wailing,Straightforward horror flick that tries to be more...,"I loved The Chaser, The Yellow Sea and of course Memories of Murder and while Horror isn't really my genre I'm willing to go on a hell-raising roller-coaster ride to unravel the frightening intrigues that this film promises. From all the reviews, the forum discussing what really happened, YouTube ""spoiler"" videos clarifying the loose ends and the chatter in the cinema when the credits start to roll, it is quite clear that the audience are mostly left greatly mystified rather than delivered by a well-resolved end moment when pieces of the puzzle start to fall together in a satisfying manner. Fans of mystery understand the need for red herrings, unexplained characters and details that throw the scent off and suggest multiple possibilities, but in this movie, they remain glaring plot holes and still don't make sense even by the end when the answer to the mystery is all but apparent. Herrings? More like leads down the garden, or rather, mountain path... It is especially frustrating as the movie is long, there's little build-up to the horrors, few techniques that could be effective in moving the story-telling along were used and the terrifying moments become repetitious and drawn-out. Many of these repetitious scenes could have been cut to focus instead on the background to some of the key characters, not only to increase audience understanding of the families, the cultural context, religious beliefs and superstitions but to help to make the final conclusions comprehensible in flashback....that ""oh I missed that bit about character X, it explains why things turn out this way, etc."" moment. Acting was really good, which is the high point of the movie for me.That's what the 5 is for.

1096,Intermission,"IRISH Movie-making by first-time director, John Crowley","One of the advantages of having enough cable channels to be able to see films that may not have made it to your local movie theaters is that you get to watch movies like Intermission. Don't ask me what intermission means for the plot. You won't want to take one while watching it, that's for sure. A lot happens and the plot jumps. What a pleasant change to watch someone on the screen who is not a humongoid ego crazed nutjob. Its very strength could also be construed as a shadow weakness in that it's almost too Americanized for comfort in the way its presented. Just watch it and see if you understand what I mean. I will give it KUDOS for presenting the actors as speaking the native tongue with enough clarity to be understood by Americans but with enough of the native brogue to keep it interesting. None of this sanitizing of the slang to the point of nausea business. When I read the description in the movie preview guide I was thinking it was another bumbling criminals bumble yet again and in the process you get a few yuks. Wrong. Intermission is more about the absurdity of human relationships that you can either laugh at or cry at. The movie's hopscotching plot is quaint and endearing yet downright bold. There is more than a fair amount of hilarity to it. You'll laugh your ass off if the type of humor is your type of humor. The director is talented. Amazing that this is his first movie.

1097,Ferris Bueller's Day Off,Not better the 2nd time,"I didn't like this movie nearly as well as most of my family and acquaintances, when it was originally released. Recently, visiting friends, they had rented it for their teenage daughter, and all watched it one evening. I thought I might enjoy it more, and having lived in Chicago previously, like to see the locales there in any film. However, I liked it even less the second time, and, frankly, have enjoyed looking at information about the film and cast on this site (IMDb) even more than seeing the picture. I found Broderick's character un-funny, annoying, and even obnoxious. It is also interesting and humorous (more than the flick) to see that naughty high-schooler Broderick was 24 when the film was made, and Alan Ruck, his laconic sidekick (also annoying in his droll lethargy) was either 29 (or 30!!). Little sister Jennifer Grey was actually 26 (two years senior to Broderick) - but at least the girlfriend was ""only"" 19. And this assumes none have ""fudged"" a couple of years on age, not uncommon for ""show biz"" personalities Another interesting factoid from this site: the actor and actress portraying the Buehler parents met on this film, and married in real life (but were later divorced at an indeterminate date). Finally, anything as ludicrous as Buehler's boarding the parade float and singing like a nightclub emcee, to the participation and enjoyment of the girls properly on the float, the marching band following, and every onlooker in sight, is not only outrageous, but not in the least bit amusing, also. When this sort of nonsense is put into this type of film, it had better be funny, and this wasn't. Equally outrageous, stupid, and even less humorous (if possible) was Buehler's supposed duping the maitre d' in the swanky restaurant. This wasn't as funny as even the weakest skits, performed every week on SNL or Mad TV - and far more appropriate to one of these.",3.0,caa821,2006/10/22,52,22

Farhad gets mad at the man for some plot contrived reason which he responds with 9/11 and terrorist slur. This pawn owner is one of the many MANY characters you will only remember as being as racist as a human possibly can. Later that night we see Ludicrous and Larenz Tate walking out of a coffee shop, Luda being unsatisfied with his service claiming racism. (BTW Ludicrous does this CONSTANTLY during the film) They see D.A Brendan Fraser and pampered wife Sandra Bullock turn away to their car. Ludicrous accuses Sandra of turning away in blind fear thinking she would be carjacked. I thought ""Huh, your kinda right. I think she did.""....up until the two carjack the Fraser and Bullock. So he brought up a racist query and then in a massive act of hypocrisy DID THE EXACT SAME THING HE ACCUSED BULLOCK OF BEING AFRAID OF!!!. Now i'm a person who thinks just because someone is a hypocrite doesn't make them wrong in what they're saying but their message is muddled incredibly when they ARE being a hypocrite. Back at the DAs house, locksmith Michael Pena is changing the lock to the house and Sandra complains about having ""one of their gang members"" is changing the locks because......she's racist....very racist. 12 minutes into the film and we are still introducing characters, we see Officers Matt Dillon and Ryan Phillippe going on their patrol hearing about the carjacking; seeing a similar black Navigator and with Matt Dillon again being a racist they pull over Terrence Howard and Thandie Newton. There under the pretense of a pat-down Dillon molests Thandie Newton....why?! WHY?! I wish i could answer that. Crash is a film that I completely and utterly despise. The whole movie is nothing more than racial slurs for no reason whatsoever. It has no redeemable characters and is full of an unbelievable amount of pretentious god-awful writing. It believes its saying something powerful but it just comes off as pretentious. Along with irredeemable characters, the film also has useless and just plain strange plot elements. There's an investigation involving Don Cheadle and his partner that seems unnecessary to the rest of the movie. There are 2 plot points that are both stupid and make no sense the most. At one moment Ludicrous accidentally runs over an Asian man standing next to his van. After ""a change of conscience"" he decides to take the van finding a good 20 chained, dirty, and most likely homeless Asian people in the back. Why were there a bunch of Asian people in the back of the van? Why didn't the Asian people not notice nothing was happening? The van was sitting in that same spot for a good day in a half. Ludicrous releases them in the middle of Chinatown. This is shown as a act of good will and possible redemption, but if you release a bunch of chained homeless people into the streets: you are getting arrested. No questions. Then there is a plot line of Farhad getting upset at Michael Pena because.....the plot called for it, which ultimately results in him pointing a gun at his face. Pena's 5 year old daughter; after her father tells her a story of his ""invisible impenetrable cloak"" that i guess is called ""foreshadowing"", leaps into his arms just as the gun goes off...but everyone is unharmed. It turns out that the gun just so HAPPENED to have blank bullets. And I guess it just so HAPPENED that Farhad had a change of heart after that. So an entirely irredeemable person is ""redeemed"" through a so called act of God or coincidence. But this character isn't redeemed because it's an act of plot contrivance. Seriously, what the hell kind of writing is this? How can a movie like Crash get made. Or hell, even green lit?!How can a movie like Crash get such critical backing? How could a movie like Crash be Best Picture, when literally EVERY OTHER CHOICE IS BETTER?!?! Its a horribly written, horribly contrived, horribly pretentious piece of cinematic trash; that I wish never to experience again.",1.0,ThisGuyLovesMovies,2012/07/06,19,13
1099,Primal Fear,Law and the Demonic Altar Boy,"The life of an altar boy is not an easy one. Worse, when the altar boy has been sexually abused, the anger embedded is deep and dark. Years later when the boy has grown to adulthood and can retaliate against the abuser, the black fury of the past results in a gruesome, violent murder. Thus the premise of Primal Fear is realized in the film of the same name. Richard Gere plays Martin Vail an attorney with superb legal abilities and an inflated ego. However, the motivating power of the movie emanates primarily from the demon plagued Aaron Stampler, superbly played by new comer Edward Norton. The heinous murder of an archbishop sets the stage for a media swamped sensational trial in which the prosecutor seeks the death penalty and the defense tries to explain how two distinct personalities exist within the tortured soul of the young man accused of the crime. Still, a very subtle and unsuspecting nuance snakes itself into the story line, like a threatening viper and if not detected will strike your soul as does the film's conclusion. Great movie and superior acting makes for a worthwhile reason to watch it. ***",7.0,thinker1691,2005/11/16,7,6

And I don't usually get tearry eyed, but I had tears of joy throughout this film because I could see myself in these characters. I grew up in a small town and could empathise with them.

1101,Ferris Bueller's Day Off,"Review of ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" (1986)","I'm sure by now you've heard of this wildly popular John Hughes film. Yeah, you know the one. The one with the teenagers who do a bunch of funny teenager things that every other teen wishes they were doing. Oh, you don't know the one I'm talking about? That's because he's made movies with this plot more times than teenage-you actually did any of these things. But guess what? He did it again with Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986). I've seen many a teen movie in my lifetime, so by now I've seen plenty of these plot-lines belly flop harder than my chubby Mexican cousin. This time around it's Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick), the popular class clown type, and his partners in crime. He easily gets his girlfriend, Sloane Peterson (Mia Sara), to go along with his latest scheme, but his best friend Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck) is a different story. He is informed by Ferris that they will be taking his father's prized possession: a 1961 Ferrari 250 GT. Ferris easily convinced his clueless parents he was on the brink of death to stay home ""sick"" from school, but not his younger sister Jeanie (Jennifer Grey). Along with her being out to get him, Principal Rooney (Jeffrey Jones) is also on his tail, fed up with his antics. Headed to downtown Chicago for the day, what could possibly go wrong? Any movie aimed at a younger audience needs that one special ingredient to keep their attention, or they will undoubtedly lose interest. You know what I'm talking about, right? Ok, say it with me now: comedy! This film is chock full of one-liners, sarcasm, and witty remarks. There is no way anyone could watch it without laughing at least once. At times the delivery is a bit much, (*cough cough* Principal Rooney -a grown man- growling many times throughout the movie), but in general the script does a good job of keeping the audience entertained. One of the most memorable features of the movie is the setting. The film is set in Chicago, and it was actually mostly shot there. Their whole adventure through Chicago was all shot in Chicago, at such famous locations like Wrigley Field, the Art Institute of Chicago, and Willis Tower. Seeing that the setting in the film is true to the shooting location is refreshing to see and gives viewers a sense of authenticity. Adding to authenticity, the acting was all there. Not counting how Cameron started out very sick and somehow just... magically got better? The interactions between the characters were extremely convincing. If I were to ever meet Matthew Broderick in person, I would expect him to be the eccentric extrovert I saw in the film. And Jennifer Grey? She would roll her eyes and walk away. Even though at the time of filming, none of these ""high school students"" were really in high school, they managed to make it feel like we were ditching school right along with them. All in all, I did truly enjoy this movie. It didn't feel like just another one of those cheesy teen movies that keep getting pushed out to make money. Compared to other movies John Hughes has done, like Sixteen Candles, this appeals to a much wider audience and was overall more impactful. I recommend this movie to anyone for a good time. Even if it's not your type you might as well watch it because after all, ""Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it"".",10.0,u-95873,2020/01/23,1,1
1102,Horrible Bosses 2,A Rare Sequel That Surpasses The Original.,"Horrible Bosses was 2011's best comedy and one of the very best that year too. It is awesome like The Hangover movies. When I heard about a sequel being made, I was all over it. Ready to see an awesome flick as a confidant to the first, the movie exceeded my expectations to the point where I thought it exceeded the first. There is ten times more danger, more complexity, and the guys actually ARE guilty of the crime they commit. Nick, Dale, and Kurt invest in a new kind of shower head and are approached by Chris Pine. He makes them an offer they disagree with, then his father (Waltz) makes them an offer they do agree with. After making their own factory and hiring many new employees, Waltz pulls the plug leaving them in debt. They then plot to kidnap Pine for ransom, but he catches them in the act and actually helps them construct a brilliant ransom. So as you can see, the three main men are guilty of kidnapping (even though Pine stopped them), fraud, and ransom. But as characters cool like The Wolfpack from The Hangover movies, you don't care how guilty they are and you just want them in the clear. There are some predictable parts that the director knew was predictable, so extreme hilarity and unpredictability from grounds around it make the predictable bit apathetic, which it good. The abundance of danger and things at stake make this movie easily more suspenseful than the first. Personally, I found this funnier than the first by just a little bit. Each character is funnier and the perilous situations I mentioned are as hilarious as they are deadly. Jennifer Aniston, Jamie Foxx, and Kevin Spacey also make returns as crazier people they were in the first. 4/4",10.0,powermandan,2014/11/30,73,35
1103,Spider-Man 2,Best one of the trilogy,"I've seen this movie on the theater twice.. once on the premiere here in Indonesia, and then the second was one week after. not just that, i even bought the DVD, trust me.. it's that good! The part that i liked best from this movie was the story. Raimi has put amazing plots to the make the movie enjoyable for everyone (even kids that doesn't care too much about the story would be amazed by the fights in it). From inner conflict, love and the fight against Doc Ock, Raimi and the scriptwriters amazed me till the end. Maguire was great. Dunst, Franco and Molina were also the vital parts that made this movie so powerful to me. Thanks Raimi, for making such wonderful superhero movie. 10/10",10.0,zaluchu,2007/06/28,8,6
1104,Detachment,Henry Barthes creates new connections and undergoes various experiences which cause him to re-think his own emotional and mental state and of those around him.,"I've never written a review for a movie before, but Detachment deserves to be watched by as many people as possible. Adrien Brody's acting is simply sublime and real, his character is one that is relatable to everyone because it speaks to the core of human nature today, a feeling of bleakness and hollowness that is innate to modern society. His performance, coupled with other superb actors, is only matched by the directing and unique animations included to deliver a powerful aesthetic work. The movie does not seek to answer any questions or provide any moral message, it illuminates and puts into words and images what most people fail to, or refuse to, recognize about today's increasingly dehumanized lifestyles and relationships. The dialogue is haunting and quite poetic, with many lines that stand out in the mind. This is the type of movie that will linger with you after the movie is finished and can resonate in a person. If you pay close attention, at least personally, I found that there is a great truth to be felt. I highly recommend this movie, it does not have high entertainment value or some outdated romantic back story but it is a beautiful work of art. I liked it that much at least, so I'd say it's worth a try watching.",10.0,terrikim13,2012/09/13,8,6
1105,Horrible Bosses 2,Annoying babbling,"If you like annoying babble with characters talking over each other, you'll love HB 2. I found the relentless cross talk terribly annoying... mostly because it occur so often in the sequel. Charlie Day as Dale Arbus was totally annoying. The movie has moments of comedy, but many of the scenes are just ruined by annoying babbling. For me, Chris Pine was the standout actor and character. Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Aniston and Jamie Fox all do a good job with their characters too. I was really looking forward to HB 2, as I liked the first movie. I felt the plot had many holes in it and there was many actions that just seemed to be put into the script just for a giggle - with no follow- up or follow-through.",2.0,vwebworld,2014/12/14,226,119
1106,Goodfellas,somehow unoriginal,"Well everyone's telling it and I hadn't tried it once, not even in cable. So here's my two cents worth of it. Ray Liotta plays an Italian-Irish boy obsessed with becoming a gangster. While seemingly getting close to a certain ""main man"" in the streets, his dreams suddenly became a reality, getting friends with two gangsters, all the money, a wife and kids, even girls, fame and fortune, all that he wanted to be...until things gone haywire. I know Scorcese is a great director, but this movie seemed like a Raging Bull reunion with Pesci and De Niro, not to mention De Niro being worn out as a Mafia/local gangster in his role, and Pesci uncontrollable in his role that I can't seem to understand he began and end up that way. If I was a gangster, I never would had liked that guy to be met in the first place...and how did Liotta get close to him? The cinematography is too much pizazz by the 90's edge that it end up being boring in, like, more than 2 hours of it (the way Scorcese make his movies these days). Too complicated idea that Liotta's role end up seeking witness protection against his ""friends"". The only thing I was impressed is Paul Sorvino's role. I think Scorcese is starting to diminish his quality movie-making and style with this movie, focusing more on popularity of stars and movie length rather than a stylish, good story movie. I had much fun better watching Taxi Driver, King Of Comedy, Last Temptation of Christ, and my favorite, Raging Bull. I'm sorry for the negative criticisms on this famous movie, but that's how I see it in an unbiased way. Although Pileggi initially wrote the novel good, he edited it with boggleness for the movie, which, err, hadn't got better.",5.0,heero_yuy2,2005/08/20,24,10
1107,Goodfellas,As good as those fellas are...I just don't get it,"I have nothing against gangster films and I love Deniro, and Liotta and Pesci...in moderation...The Godfather were brilliant films and I finally made my way around to seeing the infamously talked about 'Goodfellas.' I don't get it. I'll take the heat from any fans and I know there are scores of them...Goodfellas was average at best and simply a trashy look at a mobster from childhood to his end in the mob with some decent but over the top performance, brutally gratuitous language and violence. I suppose in some circles that equivalents to a great film but I need far more. I mean even the story has little depth to it and it's more or less an extended episode of The Sopranos without the character depth. I suppose after having the film hyped for years and hearing about the 'classic' I had high expectations but for me it was run of the mill, annoyingly loud and abrasive but with some good direction. Scorsese knows how to make an epic from beginning to end starting the film in the 50's and 60's and taking it all the way to the mid 80's is a challenge and he does it flawlessly. The gritty underworld, the dark lighting, the facial expressions all very good but put to a pointless story and sub par characters unfortunately. I finally know now why Ray Liotta is still around and still gets parts because I always found him a little obnoxious in roles and I never realized he single handedly headlined Goodfellas and is great at it. His character might be the only one in the film given any depth considering he is the narrator and focus of the film. Disgustingly Liotta got no nomination that year which is absurd because if this film deserved anything (which I don't think it did) Liotta's role was it. Robert Deniro commonly gets credit for the film as being the headliner which is also a bit absurd. He might be the big name for the film but his role was small. He didn't make a significant part in the film until a good hour into it and his role was small but he still certainly brought his Deniro class and style to the ensemble. I think they would have done better to focus more on his character and his relationship with Liotta's character. They had good chemistry but just when you wanted to see more...they moved on to something else. Joe Pesci was over the top insane, downright disturbed Tommy Devito. His performance in this film is legendary ""Oh you think I'm a clown?"" but to be perfectly honest he was ridiculous. His performance wasn't sincere or believable and he was downright annoying. He was loud and abrasive and his barrage of gratuitous language actually made the film less watchable and I am not against the use of four letter words in film but his was too much. Lorraine Bracco was quite good in her pre-Soprano role as Liotta's wife Karen who sticks with him through pretty much everything and has some powerfully emotional swings throughout the film. Paul Sorvino is good as the head of the mob family, Paulie, but he doesn't make an impact. You don't really believe anyone would respect him. He's quiet and laid back and basically hiding throughout most of the film. At least with Brando's Godfather he was an image, an icon, something you just were in awe of. The cast all work well together but their characters are so thinly written you just don't give a damn about a single one of them except maybe a little for Liotta's Jimmy Conway. I get that I'm in a severe minority speaking this way about this film and that director Martin Scorsese is like a god to some but I just didn't seem the talent in this film. Scorsese showed talent in The Departed and the cast was a million times better than Goodfellas and deserved all of it's acclaim but I personally think Goodfellas is more of a non-thinking man's mob movie where bloody brutal kills and 1000 times hearing the 'F' word would prompt a dull chuckle as though the audience were 10. No I am not trying to insult anyone I was just severely disappointed by this film after having expected a brilliant classic which I will say hands down is not the case. I suppose if you like the crime genre or moreso the gangster drama than you must see Goodfellas anyways but I can promise you there is FAR better out there than this average, poorly written film. 6/10",6.0,Robert_duder,2007/05/29,23,11
1108,The Fault in Our Stars,"worst movie i've ever seen. because it tries, assumes and fails. watch Silver Linings Playbook for real charm, story and proper acting","worst movie i've ever seen. because it tries, assumes and fails. watch Silver Linings Playbook for real charm, story and proper acting I've never had to skip a movie, right to the end, expecting something good and even then it was terrible. Everything mentioned in the 1-star reviews is true, i have NO IDEA how this reached 8.7/10. It's unbelievable Terrible, inaccurate story: taking advantage of a 'cancer' and 'dying' story and just using it to carry the whole movie? despicable and disappointing - Terrible acting: corny one-liners that had my stomach turning, i could not handle more than 5 minutes of this. Quoted from another review: ""Augustus carries around a pack of cigarettes and occasionally puts one in his mouth. Hazel is disgusted but Augustus offers this explanation: ""They don't kill you unless you light them. And I've never lit one. It's a metaphor, see: You put the killing thing right between your teeth, but you don't give it the power to do its killing. A metaphor."" That's fine, but the sight of Augustus with the cigarette in his mouth looks as ridiculous as it sounds. He puts the unlit cigarette in his mouth so often that we want to take his away from him and say ""STOP THAT!!"" The movie is loaded with strange moments like that. "" - Bad camera angles, scripting and jarring pace. Normal scenes are given heavy emphasis and over-emphasised. Nothing feels natural, the chemistry seems forced. Camera angles that linger between the two main actors for what seems achingly ages for what seems hours... I had to look away from the screen they were given so much dead focus Overall 0/10. This just takes the cake. Seriously worst movie i've ever seen and it's made me write up this darn review. If you want quality acting, from real actors and real directors, with real sweet charm, heart, good pacing and film editing, watch Silver Linings Playbook starring Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence. An infinite times more believable and lovable than this.",1.0,jykl91,2014/10/09,48,22
1109,Spider-Man 2,Spider-sequel-tastic,"My presumptions of a sequel to a successful original are that they are worn out and are a desperate attempt to cash in on it's predecessor. Look no further for conclusive evidence with the terrible Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen to know what I'm talking about. But every now and again a sequel comes along that just simply changes your perceptions and gives you faith in a continuing franchise where the sequel is just as or in the case of Spiderman 2 better than it's predecessor. Toby Maquire, Kirsten Dunst and James Franco return with director Sam Raimi who has done a terrific job in making this for me one of the best sequels of all time. One of the successes Spiderman 2 has is the depth of the characters and stories as there is more than one strand. Toby Maquire has the same natural ability which he possessed in the first film to accurately convey the character of Peter Parker who struggles with his feelings for Mary Jane who becomes frustrated that he can't return her feelings for him, to his fractured friendship with Harry Osborne who harbours a deep grudge against Spiderman to trying to balance his life as superhero, student and employee and struggling with his Aunt May over Uncle Ben's death to finally battling the new villain Oto Octavious played memorably by Alfred Molina and all these story strands thread there way through two hours of pure entertainment. With the main story and these sub-stories the film could have become confusing and meaningless but thanks to the sublime artistry from Sam Raimi, it flows beautifully and never loses sight of itself. Which goes to say the acting is as brilliant from the main cast which helps the film has more exploration and depth and the special effects this time round are flawless and much improved on the first. This has everything for the comic fans and those who just want to be entertained of action (which there is plenty of particularly towards the end) drama, romance and humour mostly from JK Simmons who when he was on screen I was laughing out loud. Credit goes to all involved and I very much look forward to Spiderman 3.",10.0,blacklist-1,2009/09/29,36,27
1110,Blackfish,A must see movie for the public,"You'll be scraping plans for the family holiday to Sea World after seeing Blackfish, Gabriela Cowperthwaite's eye opening and frankly quite scary documentary focussing on the captivity of Orca whales and in particular Tilikum a male killer whale that has a proved track record of violence towards humans. Blackfish is no doubt a very objectionable documentary where all talking heads involved are against the incarceration of these great beasts but then again the arguments and evidence presented by Cowperthwaite are hard to deny. Cowperthwaite does a fantastic job of offering reasons behind whales acting out and it's clear to see that these animals have more going on emotionally and mentally than many humans would give them credit for. This is particularly evident in the films centrepiece Tilikum. Tilikum as explained in the film was captured at a young age and suffered abuse at the hands of other whales in his various enclosures. This abuse and mistreatment has lead the whale to become angry and unpredictable resulting in the death of 3 human beings. The cover up and misleading of information regarding these deaths is quite astounding and ex-trainers of Sea World talk openly about how stunned they were that the truth behind the deaths is hidden in the public. These startling facts and first-hand accounts by trainers are all major reasons why Blackfish is a must see. Blackfish may not be the most daring or inventive documentary to reach our shores this year and it's one sided documentation of its argument can be seen of somewhat of a downfall but it's never less than compelling viewing and deserves to be seen by as many people as possible as an example of humans being humans – that is being to stupid to admit they are wrong. 3 and a half dorsal fins out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out - [URL]",7.0,eddie_baggins,2013/12/12,7,6

I knew (My Hollywood Boyfriend) Jason Bateman wouldn't let me down — he and the rest of the cast of Horrible Bosses 2 showed us how to properly put out a funny sequel. After a disappointing Dumb and Dumber To, this movie was a welcome surprise that needs to be on your list when it's your turn to pick. If you are looking at the line-up for the weekend and just want something everyone will enjoy, check out Horrible Bosses 2. It's worth the box office price with a side of popcorn and a coke! Horrible Bosses 2 was exactly what I was hoping for — a fun, great, laugh out loud movie to step away from reality a bit and hang out with some of our favorite guys. For those of us that like adding movie one-liners to our repertoire, — Bateman, Sudeikis and Day are happy to oblige. There were so many funny moments from the best characters in Horrible Bosses plus the welcome addition of Chris Pine and Christopher Waltz. The movie didn't try to remake Horrible Bosses. It didn't try to force us into a ""thou shall think this is funny"" jokes. You don't need to see Horrible Bosses to understand or enjoy the sequel. It seemed to just be a fun movie to make. When you can feel genuine chemistry on the screen it plays out for the audience. Simply put, it's just good comedy with a well written script acted by a group of folks who really seem to enjoy each other. Will it someday be on the AFI Top 100 list? No. Is it something you'll want to see again? Absolutely. Will we add it to our purchased list when released to DVD? Oh yes! It's one of those movies that is good to put on when you have someone visiting or just want a night away from drama (on screen or in life!) I'm not usually one to comment on the soundtrack — but I must say every song seemed to come straight from my playlist! Who doesn't want to enjoy a bit of Katy Perry ""Roar"" with some Macklemore & Ryan Lewis ""Can't Hold Us""! Fantastic! Are they still making movie soundtrack CD's anymore?!?! Because I'm in! On a personal note — I also enjoyed the ""American Manufacturing"" and ""American Dream"" basis for the script. Being a huge of American Manufacturing, the story was a welcome (and funny) look at the challenges of ""Making it in America"". One of my favorite lines that I think will get a chuckle out of manufacturing fans — ""The American Dream is built in China"". Hilarious. Bottom line, there are some laughs in here for everyone (unless you can't handle potty humor that's what this is full of!)

1112,Crash,Crash is about trash!,"If you are interested in seeing the usual stereotypes peddled to the extreme then this may be a good film for you. Otherwise it leaves a lot to be desired in terms of resolving the issues of all the characters - maybe I'm old-fashioned but I like to see characters at least find some resonance in their moral fibre by the end of the film, i.e. character arc. Was it me or did this film become 'jammed' full of bitter, angry, uncompromising,stubborn, narrowly-focused rugged individuals who only know that revenge and saving your own hide is the best solution of the times. Its very difficult to feel any compassion for these one-dimensional characters. I refuse to agree with this film's attempt to universally sell this idea that it's cathartic to scream, bitch, steal and generally hate the world when a stronger message could have been sent with this premise and with characters with bigger minds and fewer things to just 'say'. I found it universally verbose and stuck on the non-transcending solution of violence and remaining at the status-quo. The characters and the story did not 'move' me. I guess it did not meet my expectations and I find it quite surprising that it was rated so high. People who like this film probably aren't in touch with the real world - its not all that depressing, deprived and chaotic. This film felt like a grainy little piece of gum stuck to the bottom of my shoe. Overrated and completely uninspiring. Powerfully annoying.",1.0,gruvydru,2005/12/02,36,23
1113,Spider-Man 2,The Best Superhero Movie,"Spider-Man 2 is the way how they should make a superhero movie. We start out with Peter Parker having a crappy job, and keeps getting fired all the time, and live in a bad apartment, and is always late for work, and for class at the university. His relationship with his best friend is not going well, Harry blames Spider-Man for the death of his father(Green Goblin). Things aren't going well with Aunt May she has no money, and Mary Jane the love of his life is getting married. Not getting what he wants, Peter loses his powers as Spider-Man, and give up for good, having a normal life just as Peter Parker. Things go well, not until Peter's hero Dr. Otto Octavius a good-hearted nuclear scientist, who wants to create a first-ever successful self-sustaining fusion reaction for the welfare of mankind. He is a hero of Peter's, being the subject of his paper on fusion power, and the two become good friends. However, when the fusion experiment fails, Octavius is bonded with his handling equipment, four artificially intelligent mechanical tentacles. These convince him to carry on his dangerous experiments no matter the cost, in memory of his wife who was killed in the accident, and is dubbed Doctor Octopus by the Daily Bugle. Harry and Doc Ock make a deal, for Spider-Man in trade for the tritium. Spidey and Doc Ock have one awesome, spectacular, amazing fight in the subway trains, after Ock holds MJ hostage. Then Spidey is beaten and Harry unmasks Spider-Man and is stunned to discover that his sworn enemy is also his best friend. Peter awakens and convinces Harry to reveal Octavius' whereabouts so he can rescue Mary Jane. Spider-Man finds Doctor Octopus in an abandoned warehouse on a waterfront pier, where he's restarted his fusion experiment. After defeating Ock, Peter reveals his true identity to Octavius, who is dazed and whose tentacles are temporarily incapacitated, and pleads with him to stop the machine. Determined to end his doomsday experiment before it causes more harm, Octavius uses his mechanical arms to collapse the floor of the building, plunging the fusion device into the water below and him along with it. Mary Jane sees Peter without his mask and realizes that he is Spider-Man, but Peter tells her they can never be together, as he will always have enemies. Back at the Osborn Mansion, Harry hallucinates his own father, tells him to avenge his death, he finds all the goblin gear, learning his father was the Green Goblin. At the end of the film, Mary Jane leaves her wedding and finds Peter in his apartment, telling him that she has decided to be with him, despite the risks. She persuades Peter to finally let her in while accepting the need of his vows by letting him respond to a sudden call for help. The acting is great Toby MaGuire does an excellent job as the tormented superhero who can't have his own life, and what he wants. Alfred Molina as Doc Ock was well acted. I really think he should have gotten a nomination for best supporting actor, a really great villain an the best one. Kirsten Dunst as MJ, breath taking, she was much better in this film, as the love life of Peter Parker. James Franco as his best friend, who blames spidey for his father's death, and angry at Peter for taking pictures of spidey, a great set up there. The cast was excellent! Spider-Man 2 is the true way to make a comic book film. The sub plots worked very well, and this film shows true emotions, it's sweet, has very good romance between Peter, and MJ, and real feelings to one another, yes the actions scenes are jaw dropping and amazing, along with the incredible special effects. Spider-Man 2 has a human story, keeping its parallel plots alive and moving.The movie demonstrates what's wrong with a lot of other superhero epics: They focus on the superpowers, and short-change the humans behind them. It gives a good message, and doesn't be preachy about it. This the best comic book adaption next to Batman Begins, X2, and the original Superman. I liked many other superhero films such as Hulk, Daredevil, Fantastic 4, Blade, and more, but not enough to recommend, but Spider-Man 2 is in another category: It's a real movie, full-blooded and smart, with qualities even for those who have no idea who Stan Lee is. Spider-Man 2 is the superhero movie that would blow away, and fill amazement with comic book fans, and it's also a comic book film for people who don't like comic book films. For those of you who don't like Spider-Man, or just not into comics, watch it, you just might be surprised. 10/10",10.0,greenheadjawsuniversal,2007/08/04,10,7
1114,Moon,"The best unadvertised movie I've seen since ""Below""....","I had never heard of ""Moon"" before checking the Internet that weekend to see what was playing in my area. When I saw it was rated R and filmed in England, that was a ""Go"" for me, and boy am I not sorry (although I did have to drive about twenty miles to the nearest cinema that had it). The problem for me here is that I would have to give away major plot points to discuss this at all coherently, and for the viewer the discovery of these plot points for oneself is a big plus. So here's what I'll say just to try to get you to see it in the (probably limited) time it'll be in theaters. Essentially a cross between ""Silent Running"" and ""Outland"" with elements from ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""Solaris"" mixed in, it features Sam Rockwell (last seen by me a decade ago as a death-row inmate in ""The Green Mile"") and the voice of Kevin Spacey as a robot. Rockwell's character Sam Bell works alone (or does he?) at a lunar outpost producing helium for use on earth. (The company for whom he works has a slick ad proclaiming their dedication to humanity's needs, so we know they're doubtless up to no good.) He has a three-year contract nearing it's end. He has pictures and recorded messages from his family (suspiciously, no live communication from earth is available). He has the robot attending to his every need; in maybe the movie's best touch, the robot has a ""face"" consisting of those excruciatingly annoying ""smiley face"" ""emoticon"" symbols (the voice is Spacey's trademark monotone). As Bell starts winding down his tour preparing for his anticipated replacement, he starts ""seeing things,"" and that's as far as I want to go plot-wise. ""Okay,"" you may be wondering, ""exactly what should draw me to this?"" A virtuoso performance by Rockwell, making one wonder why he hasn't been a ""big star"" already; superb special effects--you won't believe this was shot in a studio in only about a month; a sustained mood that becomes ever more ominous yet poignant as it goes along; plot twists that shouldn't strain your credulity nor insult your intelligence; besides, to repeat, it's rated R (although I'm not sure why except for a few F-words). Come on, folks, we need to let the movie moguls know there's an adult market out here, and not just for horror flicks or sex comedies! One more thing: if you think a robot can't ""act,"" watch for when this one gently puts it's mechanical arm on Bell's shoulder; stunning how effective it is...",,BigBabe0,2009/07/13,14,8
1115,Crash,this won an award??,"I saw this movie a few weeks back and was very disappointed. I had seen all the nominated films for the BEST PICTURE academy award but had not seen CRASH because it wasn't in theaters very long and I missed it. AFter it became the Academy's BEST PICTURE OF THE YEAR it was re-released to theaters and I went to see it right away. What a disappointment! While I definitely agree that there is much discrimination in our world today, I felt that the script was poorly written because, in real life, people wouldn't say some of those things out loud. An example: after Sandra Bullock and her husband experience a car-jacking, the return home and immediately have all their house locks changed. Ms. Bullock's character starts screaming that she want to have all the locks changed again in the morning because she believes the hispanic man changing the locks is going to sell the keys of the locks that he just installed to his hispanic friends. Ms. bullock's character is an intelligent, sophisticated woman who, even if she did believe that it was necessary to have the locks changed again, she would whisper this to her husband OR express her thoughts after the hispanic man left her house. But, there's no way she would scream and yell that she wants the locks changed again because she doesn't trust the hispanic man who is currently in her house! The film is full of scenes that do not match reality. When the two black men are stopped after a chase and Matt Dillon's partner convinces his fellow officers to 'let them go with a warning', they never looked inside the car; they didn't even approach the vehicle. In real life, there's no way this would have happened and they would have seen the other occupants of the car. So, this film might be a little entertaining but it says little because it does not match what would actually happen in the real world. 'Crash' is REAL trash!",1.0,jh2109,2006/04/12,70,42

1117,The Wailing,A very unpredictable movie...,"""The Wailing"" (aka ""Goksung"") is a South Korean pseudo-horror movie, and that alone already counts well in favor for the movie, as South Korea has a long, and most impressive, track record for making horror movies. The movie runs a bit over two and a half hours, but it actually manages to remain interesting and captivating throughout the course of this time frame. The story is about a strange disease that spreads in a small rural settlement in South Korea. This disease causes rashes and blisters, and eventually drives the infected to kill those he or she loves in blind rage. A local policeman becomes involved in the case and finds himself deep in a very strange mystery, which involves supernatural elements and it is a race against time to find the culprit and the source of this bizarre sickness. I will say that the story is good and interesting, especially because director Hong-jin Na managed to build up the movie in such a way that the audience is given bits and pieces of information throughout the course of the movie, and thus keeps the audience in the dark and trying to put the pieces together themselves and trying to figure out who is the cause of it all. And just when you think you have it all figured out, something happens and the movie takes an unforeseen turn, which just further keeps the audience on edge and trying to make sense of it all. That was a nice thing in the movie, because it kept it from being predictable, and it forces the audience to actually do some thinking throughout the course of the movie. The acting in the movie was quite good, which is a common trait seen in South Korean movies, so there were no surprise there. As always it is an enjoyment to sit down and watch another South Korean movie. Without giving anything away, then I will say that just as I thought I had it all figured out, then the director opted for something else entirely towards the ending, and threw me fully of the trail. I had not seen that ending coming, not by a long shot. But, personally, I didn't care much for how the movie ended and the realization of what was really going on. It was just a bit too much, to far out there for my taste. Especially since the movie had been so good and intriguing up to that point. It just took a nosedive with that unveiling, and as such I am forced to rate the movie only a six out of ten stars rating. That being said, don't get me wrong, because ""The Wailing"" really is a good movie, it is just that I didn't enjoy the ending in the least bit. But if you enjoy Asian movies and South Korean movies in particular, then ""The Wailing"" is a solid horror/mystery movie which definitely is worth watching.",6.0,paul_haakonsen,2016/10/15,13,4
1118,Primal Fear,Edward Norton could not have picked a better film in which to debut.,"Primal Fear, directed by Gregory Hoblit, written by Steve Shagan and Ann Biderman is based on the book by William Diehl. Primal Fear is one of the few examples of a psychological thriller with young, new talent shinning in a film with a great script and excellent direction. Edward Norton could not have picked a better film in which to debut. When Arch Bishop Rushmen is murdered in his office, a young parishioner, Aaron Stampler, is found running from the scene covered in blood. The police follow him to a train yard where he is eventually arrested. When Stampler, expertly played by Edward Norton, is captured by the police he is obviously terrified, unexpectedly meek, and can't make eye contact. Stampler's prominent stutter and introverted personality make his guilt difficult to digest. Richard Gere's character, the smarmy defense attorney Richard Vail, sees the capture on the local news and decides to represent Stampler pro-bono for the publicity. He leaves his cover page interview to get to Stampler's cell before any other defense attorney does. The first half of the movie plays like a thrilling murder trial drama. District Attorney, Janet Venable, played by Laura Linney, tirelessly and doggedly pursues Stampler. Evidence is covertly and excitingly collected. Light is shined on different aspects of the case by both the DA and the defense attorney. Vail tracks down another alter boy who tells him the sins of the Arch Diocese and that he taped them. Vail gets the video and it rocks the case from a simple church slaying to a complicated case of blame the victim. This is only one of the first masterfully written plot turns that keeps you on the edge of your seat and unable to truly grasp the situation fully. Vail orders a psychological evolution for Stampler. The interview brings to surface a Stampler's mental illness. When Stampler's mental illness (I won't ruin it for you) is revealed to his psychologist, it is horrifying and rocks the viewer with an unexpected jolt. His guilt or innocence is no longer easy to figure out and isn't a case of black or white. The rest of the courtroom drama rests on your perception of the guilt or innocence of Aaron Stampler. Courtroom drama isn't the only drama. Interrelated to the case there is a subplot about rich business men, murder, church corruption and mobsters. Yeah, it could go downhill fast and sounds cheeseball but it works. The subplot gives Vail motivation for passionately defending his client. Richard Gere flawlessly plays the grandiloquent Vail. Vail must believe, disbelieve, question, and wonder about Stampler's guilt. Even so, Gere's acting never misses the mark. He gives new meaning to smarmy and surprise. Even so, his acting is far outshined by Edward Norton's disturbing performance. Edward Norton's character ranges from pitiful to downright scary. The challenge of Norton's character is portraying a man who might be guilty but making it so hard to conceive that your mind can't get around it. Portraying a person with the mental illness (I'm still not going to tell you) Stampler has is extremely difficult to do with out turning the part into a poltergeistic mess but Norton leaves you with your mouth hanging open, unable to speak. It is no wonder that Norton was nominated for an Academy Award for this role. Gregory Hoblit's direction is worthy of applause. The fragile nature of all the relationships is a thread he had to walk like a tightrope. Each actor's performance would have devastated the film if it were over or underacted. Still, Hoblit was able to get passion and coldness at the exact level the character, the relationships and the film required. It was as if he wanted his direction to cook the perfect omelet. Too long in the pan and it's rubber, too short and it's soupy, just right and it's breakfast. This film is an exceptional work of cinematic art. Every character is multi-dimensional, perfectly written and wonderfully acted. I could watch this movie over and over again and it doesn't lose a thing.",10.0,laraemeadows,2007/01/09,49,44
1119,The Wailing,totally banged my head,"its literally a melting pot of every single genre. it starts with bucolic nostaligc scenery with a fisherman chilling on the hill. The view of goksung is really nice. who would think about terrible thing to happen? But, this bucolic town soon face mysterious case. it was just.... im not a really horror movie person. During the entire show, i was so startled and regretted my decision of watching that movie. However, in the end, i had to admit that the movie was superb. The biblical quote from the beginning was a hopeful message. Such a bless in disguise. The entire show is an amalgamation of Asian and European culture. Zombie thing is included but it does not hurt the ambiance of Asian horror movie. Most of horror movie hav their own pattern and if it's exposed, then it makes the viewer less freaked out. However, goksung conceal the pattern and make us keep question to ourselves. Who's the source of problem? and will the protagonist get over it? i couldn't get over it.

1120,Spider-Man 2,Avenge me......,"Peter Parker cannot seem to catch any kind of break. Being Spider-Man has brought him nothing but problems as far as his personal life is concerned. Mary Jane Watson is engaged to astronaut John Jameson, and Peter may lose her forever. Things are so bad for him that he is pushed past his breaking point, so he decides that he doesn't want to be Spider-Man anymore, until a freak accident transforms Dr. Otto Octavius into Dr. Octopus, a super-villain with four metal tentacles protruding from his torso. Peter realises that only Spider-Man can stop him but, of course, problems arise. Mary Jane gets caught in the middle, and Harry Osborn, who still blames the web-slinger for the death of his father Norman Osborn, also the Green Goblin, wants him dead. Spider-Man will have to push himself past his limits if he's going to survive.... Easily the best of the franchise, Spider-Man 2 also raises the benchmark in Marvel movies, this being the character driven and empathetic. What make it work is the way Raimi harnesses all of the characters stories, and how he doesn't let them spiral out of control, is amazing. There is so much going on in this film, that it demands to be seen at least two times. Once as the blockbuster action-fest you want, and the other as a character study. It's a lot of fun too. From Raimis trademark POV use of camera-work when Octaviuse first kills, to the obligatory Campbell Cameo, the film works on many levels. Maguire is much better this time around, having less of the rabbit in the headlight face, and just getting on with it. But Franco is really the main draw out of the regular cast. His dark side emanates evil whenever something goes wrong, and you can see that he will be a foe who causes great difficulty to Parker. It's one of the best sequels to a summer movie, and it's a great film to boot also.",8.0,FlashCallahan,2012/07/15,16,10
1121,Death of a Salesman,Depressive and Tragic Theatrical Movie With Awesome Performances,"On the age of sixty and something years, the salesman Willy Loman (Dustin Hoffman) realizes that he is a loser and his empty life was a worthless fraud. The disturbed and deranged Willy becomes delusional, mixing fantasy and reality, and disclosing secrets of his family. ""Death of the Salesman"" is a very depressive and tragic theatrical movie with awesome performances, mainly of Dustin Hoffman, Kate Reid and John Malkovitch. I have never read Arthur Miller's novel or seen the movie or the play; therefore I did not expect such a sad story with so complex characters. The story, in the 40's, shows the evil face of the capitalism (and the American Dream), and the character of Dustin Hoffman becomes insane when he sees that he is a loser and his life a complete failure: he is paying the last installment of his old house after thirty years of sacrifice; his sons have not been successful in life; his old car is broken; his old refrigerator needs repair; he does not have any money after more than thirty years working for the same company and in the end he is treated like a street dog and fired. For a viewer that does not know this drama (like me), I recommend to see this movie in a happy day, otherwise he or she may become too much depressed with such heart-breaking story. My vote is eight.

1123,Ferris Bueller's Day Off,"""Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.""","I remember watching this movie, and while I loved the first 2 acts, both full of endless laughter, I couldn't help but think that Ferris Bueller was something of a narcissist. He does many seemingly selfish things; lying to his parents, humiliating his principal, and putting his 'best friend' in danger, all so he can have 7 carefree hours off of school. It is not until the 3rd act that he becomes a 3-dimensional character, and we begin to understand him and realize he is not the sociopath we might have assumed he is. While it seems he does all the things he does for his own pleasure, it becomes clear in the last 20 minutes he was really doing it for his friend. At the beginning of the movie, Cameron is timid, constantly worried, and unsure of himself. We learn his parents argue, and his dad neglects him, and would rather work on his Ferrari instead of spending time with his son. Throughout the movie, Ferris tries to boost his friend's self-esteem, and by the end, he has succeeded. His friend is a completely different person, and most of the major characters are, notably his sister. However, Ferris doesn't seem to change at all. He helps his friends become better people, but in doing so, he isn't changing at all.",8.0,richardtownsley-19550,2020/06/16,8,7
1124,Horrible Bosses 2,Not bad for a comedy sequel,"I watched both 'Horrible Bosses' films back to back and it's clear that the first movie is the better of the two. 'Horrible Bosses 2' has its moments but lacks ideas and the originality of the first film. The guys are a lot more stupid in the sequel, they reminded me a lot of the Hangover trio. Whether that was deliberate or not I don't know, but they weren't that dumb in the first film. By the standards of the average comedy movie, it's not bad. I laughed a few times, which is more than can be said about a lot of comedy sequels. Like in the first film, Aniston and Sudeikis are the highlight for me. Both are brilliant in their roles. 'Horrible Bosses 2' isn't as bad as some would have you believe, but there's a clear lack of ideas here.",5.0,areatw,2017/08/19,27,23
1125,Spider-Man 2,Maintains the energy of the first one,"A cut above the typical comic book movie, S-M 1 did what this type of movie is supposed to do: introduce the main characters, have 'em fight a Super Bad Guy, and then have it all end happily ever after, for the most part. In other words, for the first movie in a supposed franchise, you have to allow time for exposition of the protagonist's background, even if millions already know him from another medium. With S-M 2, though, such an obligation isn't necessary. We've met Spidey, MJ, Aunt May, et al., and we're ready to jump into a new story. So while the first one explains why Spidey is, the second movie devotes more time to fighting the Bad Guy du Jour, Doctor Octopus. Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) still pines for MJ (Kirsten Dunst), from whom he steers clear despite his undying affection for her. It's for her own good, he tells himself. If we're together, my enemies will top at nothing to get at me through her, and I can't put her in that position. And so, in typical superhero fashion, he broods and broods and broods. The relentless push-and-pull between his love for MJ and his devotion to using his powers for good is a constant theme in the Spider-Man universe, and in the movies it either smolders in the background or charges with a raging fury to the forefront. Peter is given the impossible choice - true love or good deeds - and it's a choice to which, at its core, everyday people can relate; we all have exceedingly difficult choices to make throughout our lives. And in this especially, the movies succeed. Peter Parker is supposed to be an average teen - well, except for those powers he has. He's not morally superior. He's not smarter. He's just a poor schlub who accidentally has these super powers, and he doesn't quite know how to deal with them. On a smaller scale, a comparison can be made to a supremely talented collegiate football player who's just made it to the pros. He has otherworldly talents. He has money, fame, fortune. And can he handle it? About as well as Peter can. Anyway, the big villain here is the aforementioned Doc Ock (Alfred Molina), yet another in a long line of Good Scientists Gone Wrong. You may recall that the Green Goblin from the first S-M movie was also of this line. This Doc has found a way to manipulate metallic tentacles with his mind. (It helps that the tentacles are physically attached to him.) Something goes wrong, he goes mad, and next thing you know it, he's gonna take over the world. Give these boys a Happy Meal, and they'd still want two prizes. Along with the inevitable Spidey-Doc Ock battles, Peter Parker's best friend Harry (James Franco) is still quite resentful as Spidey's killing of his father in the first movie. He doesn't know Peter is Spider-Man, but he knows only Peter is able to take photographs of him. So the second thematic struggle is within Harry - does he resent his friend for knowing the murderer (in his eyes) of his father? All of the cast returns from the first movie (well, all that survived the first movie), and they all do a collective good job. Maguire is a perfect choice for the lead; he's unassuming, can't really emote, is stoic, and even a little bit wimpy. All are qualities that plague the characters of both Spider-Man and Peter Parker.",8.0,dfranzen70,2004/12/20,144,93

1128,Moon,One lonely film,"I have to disagree with the high ratings for this film. The story, as it has it, is quite far out when it comes to logic. There is no lunar gravity inside the station, and the implausibility of this base being staffed by 1 person, who discovers that there are a whole bunch of clones with his DNA being stored and readied for action, and eventually the eventuality that he is not the original. There is quite an emotional touch in the film, however, one which the core of the film revolves around, involving the family of the central protagonist that leaves his family and finds himself removed from having live contact to his daughter and his wife, only to discover he was unable to message them directly. A heart moving sequence reveals what has actually happened in the duration that this clone of Sam has missed while been away, which is touching and eerily depressing. I found myself wanting to stop the film due to the sense of loneliness prevalent in it and sterile 'HAL' (from Space Oddysey) interactions, but found that I wanted to play it through to the logical conclusion to reveal what actually happened, and to see the protagonist reunited with his daughter, and righteousness restored. None of this is covered, however, and you're left with a blank with only a few lines of text to explain the story of this clone that would have occurred on his return. So the situation is never resolved, and thinking about this draws a bit of a mental blank. In essence, the film leaves you feeling that this barbaric act of cloning a single miner on the moon is something that would still be continuing, without anybody on earth raising some sort of alarm about the situation, and thus this morbid act continuing on forever. Not a happy film by any means.",7.0,earthguy,2010/04/25,34,17

Graphics are good, voices so and so (but that is just a personal opinion), music/songs nothing special. So no, I wouldn't watch it again and neither will I recommend it to anyone I know.

1132,Spider-Man 2,Balanced almost as perfectly as an egg on the back of a spoon,"Having enjoyed the first Spider-Man movie, I was looking forward eagerly to this movie, and to bluntly ruin the surprise, I was impressed beyond expectations. In a superhero movie, good action is usually a given, but a good story is hard to manage, and Spider-Man 2 honorably handles both these elements with a grace that equals Spidey's when he's web-swinging across the skyscrapers of New York City. Spider-Man 2's story, which is themed on internal strife, is one of the mature and realistic I've ever seen in a superhero movie, and it portrays the duality of the protagonist and antagonist's lives very effectively. Spider-Man 2 is also one of the few superhero movies that manage to be serious without getting dragged or seeming self-obsessed. But even with its seriousness, Spider-Man 2 proudly embraces the lightness of its origins with J.K. Simmons' hilarious stints as the brash Daily Bugle editor J. Jonah Jameson, Doc Ock's dark sarcasm, a side-splitting scene with Spidey taking an elevator and a cameo by Bruce Campbell as an annoying doorkeeper at a theater, along with more subtle humorous moments with Peter Parker. Amazingly, none of the humor feels out of place, cheesy or overdone. However, Spider-Man 2's story is not without its flaws, almost all of which had to do with prematurely revealing Spidey's secret identity, something that should have been delayed as late as possible in the series. The first time Harry does the unmasking (thanks to some good help from Doc Ock), which should've been avoided but wasn't as paining as the second time, when Spidey deliberately takes off his half-damaged mask during the climax, revealing his identity to a train full of passengers. Perhaps sensibly, the movie makes no effort at explaining the knock-on effects of the revelation of a superhero's identity in a place like NYC (especially with people like J. Jonah Jameson around), but then why unmask Spidey in front of an entire crowd in the first place? But since this is just one inconsistency in an otherwise superb plot, it's somewhat forgivable. The action sequences are much, much better than the first movie, and probably the best I've ever seen in a superhero movie. While the first Spider-Man featured a good deal of almost kung fu like action, this time around Spidey grapples and smashes objects on a far bigger scale  the best of which occur on the façade of a skyscraper and on top of an elevated train (the climax). But what makes it all so exciting is that Spidey does all this against four mechanical tentacles that are essentially the arms of his nemesis, Doc Ock. Talking of Doc Ock, I feel that it's necessary to mention that his tentacles feel so organic and natural in their movements that it feels like they're actually his arms, controlled by his own muscles; in fact, they're even capable of emoting when needed, such as during the more dramatic scenes when Doc Ock questions his conscience, which is a big feat in itself. Spidey's costume has also undergone some subtle changes this time; the colors are richer, the lenses are whiter and maybe a little more opaque, and the costume generally looks more imposing on-screen. The acting is miles better than the first movie from the ENTIRE cast, with Tobey Maguire and Alfred Molina taking the top spots in the major roles. However, Kirsten Dunst still had more room for expression. There is also something unique about the way the web-swinging scenes are filmed that I didn't feel in the first movie; it feels like you're swinging with Spidey. I later found out that this was the result of a new camera-work technique called the Spyder-Cam; anyways, great stuff. The cinematography is also top-notch throughout the movie, and especially so during the action sequences. Overall, Spider-Man 2 is a tremendous leap forward in every aspect from its already-impressive predecessor, and in my honest opinion, quite simply the best superhero movie made so far (since this review is pretty late, I include the extremely overrated Dark Knight in that too). RATING: 9/10.",9.0,retroguy02,2008/08/14,9,7
1133,Goodfellas,A perfect film.,"This has everything a movie should have. A great story, acting, cinematography, direction, (I will never understand how Scorsese did not win his 1st Oscar!) production values, I can go on and on. There is nothing that isn't done perfectly on this film. If this were to come out in any given year it would be considered a classic. I understand that there are the hardcore devotee's to The 1st two Godfather films, but to me (and many others) this is the quintessential gangster film. I used to watch this film over and over and I usually try and nitpick even some of of the all time great films, but there is nothing I can pick on in this film! I had kind of seen Scorsese films before and really liked most of them, (Taxi Driver, & Raging Bull especially) but ever since ""Goodfellas"" I would follow everything he did. I didn't follow the Oscars when I was a kid, but was shocked to learn this didn't win Best Picture however the fact that ""Dances with Wolves"" did was one of the few times I wish the Oscar should could have been shared. As much as I loved ""Wolves"" ""Goodfellas"" has held up as the better picture.

1134,The Chorus,Greatly stirring foreign film,"Its really interesting watching film that were foreign. You don't have to understand their language at all, provided by subtitles. However what you would truly appreciate with most of them is their earthly brilliant stories you would never expect to see. Les Choristes, simply ""The Choir"" brought me interest and joy in seeing another wonderful film of all times. Truthfully the film didn't get too tight in improving the mood of the story. The atmosphere, the characters, the background musics, effects and the rest of the film were carefully made presentable and good. The characters are also justly comprehensible. Clement Mathieu (Gerard Jugnot) had incredibly brought into stage a character the situation deems impossible to materialize. He became the teacher he had to be in the story and his character is firm enough to portray it till the end. Rachin (Francois Berleand), the principal (His face is really familiar) also had the character, which I describe as swift, sharp and annoying but you would consider interesting as well. I got the moment when I find his character shifting, but got failed to expect he would change because it is in his nature of being so stone-hearted. You would hate or despise him but nevertheless that's what got you into hating his character, his capability to capture our attention is one truly appreciable aspect he had. There were also other characters you deem fit with their roles, good and reasonable such as Chabert (Kad Merad), Monsieur Langlois (Philip Du Janerand), La Pere Maxence (Jean-Paul Bonnaire), Violette Morhange (Marie Bunel), and of course the rest of the children. I didn't solely love the story, the beauty of the atmosphere and the background music also made chills and goosebumps for me. Wonderfully this foreign film is truly worth cherishing.

This was also a brilliant start for a bunch of kids who have never acted and are the actual singers. It was also filmed during the hottest summer of 2002 in France. Chapeau as they say in France! I have bought the DVD and still have tears at the end of the movie. It is a must see for kids of all ages. The music is wonderful, especially if you speak French, but the melodies are still excellent, no matter what. Kids in Belgium and France are now singing these songs in school.

1136,The Green Mile,The Least Of us,"I'm glad that a number of reviewers have informed me that this highly unusual tale was a faithful adaption from the novel by Stephen King. I'm not much of a fiction reader so it is gratifying to hear that his vision got to the screen intact. I would not have guessed this film would have come from a horror story writer. No monsters from the id or any place else are present in this story set in the American South of the Thirties. But demons do exist in The Green Mile and there is a man named John Coffey who takes them unto himself. The Green Mile refers to the cell block housing the inmates scheduled for Death Row. In that cell block comes Michael Clarke Duncan who is close to seven feet tall and maybe weighing 400 pounds. He's also as docile as a baby lamb and whose only request is that they leave a night light burning because he gets a little afraid of a strange place in the dark. Of course the guards who have the typical white Alabama attitudes of the day don't quite know what to make of them, but Tom Hanks who captains the cell block and most of the rest find out just how special he is. And Hanks cannot believe that someone like Duncan could possibly be guilty of a double rape/murder of a child. This modern day parable of the Jesus story has King telling us that it is very possible that many of his kind have walked the earth with talents for healing. One of them got a religion worked around him, but they can come in all walks of life and certainly no one would expect one to come in the guise of an illiterate black Alabama sharecropper. But one of my favorite Bible verses has Jesus himself saying that what you do unto the least of my brethren you do unto me. Somebody of Michael Clarke Duncan's size and build is not going to get too many really good roles and he certainly hasn't played anything remotely like John Coffey again. Parts like that don't come along and the film seems almost to have been built around him. It's one of the most moving performance that has ever been put on film in history. And it's an incredibly difficult role, he's meek for his size and Uncle Tom like, but as we learn far from it. In fact Coffey is beyond what the ordinary human mind can comprehend. Duncan received one of four Academy Award nominations that The Green Mile got, in his case for Best Supporting Actor. Since the film is built around him, my only question is why was it the Supporting Actor category? The Green Mile was also nominated for Best Picture, Best Sound and Best Adapted Screenplay, but did not come home a winner in any of these. A pity that one of the best films of the Nineties could not get at least one Oscar. Where there's a Christ-like figure you also have some devil spawn villains and we have a pair of them in Sam Rockwell as another death row prisoner and David Hutchison as a rat of a prison guard with both connections and issues. What happens to them is both poetic and diabolical in true Stephen King tradition. Others in the cast of note are Bonnie Hunt as Mrs. Hanks, James Cromwell and Patricia Clarkson as the warden and his wife, David Morse and Barry Pepper as two other guards on the block and Michael Jeter as another prisoner with a remarkably trained 'circus' mouse. The Green Mile is a remarkable allegorical picture and might be considered for Easter time viewing if it has a season. It certainly will make folks think.",10.0,bkoganbing,2009/12/07,21,14
1137,The Green Mile,"Magical,marvelous, and moving.","One of the most moving films ever put on screen is director Frank Darabont's The Green Mile, a deep,tragic, and overall wonderful film that teaches lessons, reaches into your heart, and leaves you taken off your feet, and sad. The Green Mile is told through the eyes of a prison guard named Paul(Tom Hanks) and a year he spent with John Coffey(Michael Clarke Duncan), a death row inmate who has miraculous powers. As the film goes on, you get to know Coffey, and you love him, though, he's impossible to hate. The Green Mile is one of the most heart wrenching films I have ever seen. Aside from its wonderful story, there are characters here that you grow to love, such as Paul and John, but yet there are characters that you really grow to hate, and that brings me to the unbelievably fantastic performances. Aside from Duncan's marvelous Coffey, the best performance here is from Doug Hutchinson as Percy, the films most hatable character. He's not the bad guy, but if you've seen this guy you wouldn't be surprised if he was. Percy is an arrogant doushbag, and you really can't stand him. I hated him more than the film's actual villain(not going to reveal). In 3 hours, Darabont focuses on the characters and the story lines, which I admire. These are some of the best 3 hours I have ever spent. And even though The Green Mile ends on such a sad note, I have to say that I preferred it over The Shawshank Redemption. Sue me, I don't care.

1138,The Green Mile,It will stay with you for a long time.,"The Shawshank Redemption is possibly my favorite movie ever. I had seen many movies before it, and I've certainly seen a lot after, but not many of them made me feel what that one did. Now, I have that feeling again. And once again, it comes from watching a Frank Darabont movie. I couldn't possibly explain the overload of emotions I experienced in the 3 hours it lasts. I have laughed. I have felt the emotions of every character. And most of all, I have cried. Very few movies have touched me like this one. Is there something to say about the acting that hasn't been said before? No, it isn't. You may have heard it is flawless, incredible, whatever. You did hear right, it absolutely is. I can't think of anyone in the whole movie that wasn't convincing in the least. The script has its funny moments, but it's incredibly deep, poignant and heartfelt. The characters are so ""human"" and unpretentious you can't help but adore them. But, well, there will be some you'd like to strangle. There has to be a villain everywhere, right? The Green Mile is a movie I will hardly forget. You can't possibly forget such an emotive story.

After the first watching I promised myself that I had to wait 5 years to watch it again. And I did!

1140,October Sky,"Excellent family movie, and a fine story","I first saw Jake Gyllenhaal in Jarhead (2005) a little while back and, since then, I've been watching every one of his movies that arrives on my radar screen. Like Clive Owen, he has an intensity (and he even resembles Owen somewhat) that just oozes from the screen. I feel sure that, if he lands some meaty roles, he'll crack an Oscar one day... That's not to denigrate this film at all. It's a fine story, with very believable people (well, it's based upon the author's early shenanigans with rocketry), a great cast  Chris Cooper is always good, and Laura Dern is always on my watch list  with the appropriate mix of humor, pathos, excitement...and the great sound track with so many rock n roll oldies to get the feet tapping. But, this film had a very special significance for me: in 1957, I was the same age as Homer Hickham; like him, I looked up at the night stars to watch Sputnik as it scudded across the blackness; like Homer also, I experimented with rocketry in my backyard and used even the exact same chemicals for fuel; and like Homer, I also had most of my attempts end in explosive disaster! What fun it was... I didn't achieve his great (metaphorical and physical) heights though. But, that's what you find out when you see this movie. Sure, it's a basic family movie, but that's a dying breed these days, it seems. Take the time to see it, with the kids: you'll all have a lot of good laughs.",8.0,RJBurke1942,2007/03/18,29,27

Certainly one of the things that stands out the most is the New York setting, the city is practically a character in the film, the soundtrack is also great, the direction of Scorsese needs no comments, and the feature has what is in my opinion the best character study in the history of cinema. Judie Foster also looks great in the film, showing that at just twelve years of age she was an excellent actress, and even received an Oscar nomination for best supporting actress.

1142,Blackfish,Everyone should watch this film,"I know I won't get any sleep tonight, this film starts out with a very disturbing story about how Tillikum was captured from the wild. I don't know what kind of heartless monster would be unmoved by his mother's anguished cries as she is separated from her baby, but if it doesn't have any effect on you then I suppose you qualify to work in seaworld's corporate office. If the whale is so safe, maybe seaworld's attorneys should be chucked into his pen and we'll see how many survive. I felt that this eye-opening film was quite balanced, they presented arguments from both sides, but seaworld declined to participate in it. Their decision to blame a girl's ponytail for her death by Tillikum was reprehensible, and when the real story came out, seaworld backpedaled like you wouldn't believe. This film brings up larger implications about wild animals; seaworld claims to be educating the public, but their shows only spread misinformation, which is documented on camera. There is no valid reason to keep an orca in captivity, certainly not for conservation efforts, which otherwise seem appropriate for threatened or endangered animals. This leaves the unsettling conclusion that seaworld is clearly exploiting the whales for financial gain and nothing more. I look forward to the day when seaworld is finally shut down by whatever means brings about its demise: a supreme court decision, a change in local laws, public outrage at the barbaric practice of keeping gigantic animals in tiny enclosures, multiple civil lawsuits lobbed at them, bankruptcy, etc. After viewing this film, does anyone else imagine Tillikum being returned to the wild?

1143,The Chorus,What it's really about,"This movie isn't really about the love the teacher has for his students. This movie is really about society, but mostly about abuse of authority. Technically a teacher or principal should love kids to be able to do their job. In the movie the results of this abuse are apparent specially when the school burns down, the name of the orphanage is also a dead give away for the theme of this movie. It is quite obvious that the principal is getting his revenge on society by channeling his anger through the kids. The teacher I think is trying to break the vicious circle of this abuse by giving the students confidence, trust, hope and dreams saving them on numerous occasions from the abuse and allowing them to open up. I found it was an excellent movie that had some very profound impact on me having lived something similar in college.",10.0,eric-des-courtis,2004/12/14,6,2

When the desperately insecure and emotionally inarticulate John breaks up with Deirdre to 'give her a little test' his plan backfires leaving her broken-hearted and him alone and miserable. Through chance and coincidence, their break-up triggers a roller coaster ride of interweaving escapades in the lives of everyone around them.

So what does Intermission have to offer that these films do not? For one, the acting talent involved is pretty much a who's who of Irish (and Scottish) actors at present. Colin Farrell, Cillian Murphy, Colm Meaney, Shirley Henderson and Kelly Macdonald. The other main factor in the quality of Intermission lies in it's script, which comes across as funny, engaging and despite the comparisons made above is fairly original. It is most definitely a lighter affair than some of it's contemporary rivals listed above, and though not groundbreaking by any means, is a well-made and engaging piece of work There is an extra scene during the credits showing Noeleen and Sam, who have presumably gotten back together. Noeleen is pestering Sam about changing the TV channel, and her nagging manner may give a hint why Sam left her in the first place Colin Farrell performs ""I Fought The Law"" over the end credits .

1146,Ferris Bueller's Day Off,Offspring,"Well, this movie started off really well, in a fast and entertaining pace. However, after some while, I could guess exactly where this movie was going, and surely knew it wouldn't bring anything new or extraordinary to the genre. Even Charlie Sheen worked in this picture, looking like a vampire from ""Twilight""; I could barely recognize him being that young-- I'm more used to his age in ""Two and a Half Men"" era. Main character is a sharpie guy that fools everybody and, in the end, gets away with murder. His sister, a correct girl that does everything right, ends up being labeled as the bad guy off the story. These scenes are at least useful to remind us that good people always end up being misunderstood. Obviously this film inspired many of modern teen comedies, such as ""American Pie"", ""Not Another Teen Movie"", ""Road Trip"", among others. I confess that I enjoyed 1988's ""License to Drive"" much more than this one, even thought that movie copied many aspects of this. Also, Marlon Wayans' productions are much better in making you laugh. All in all, it's an interesting movie for the time it was released, but offers nothing different of modern comedies.",7.0,raulfaust,2013/01/14,7,4
1147,Death of a Salesman,A challenging drama with a forceful message in its core,"A thought-provoking, heartfelt and tragic story that is based on a Pulitzer Prize winning play, Death of a Salesman is a very compelling character study of an aging man who is blinded by his pride, integrity and overly-ambitious goals he carries for his eldest son. The film expertly evokes themes of work, love, family and fatherhood, as an old salesman struggles to cope with the emptiness of his life, while also constantly being tormented by his own personal frustration and disappointment. Dustin Hoffman gives an outstanding performance in the leading role and is accompanied by a strong supporting cast, with John Malkovich and Kate Reid being particularly noteworthy, as all the characters are key in contributing to the overall moral of the story. However, perhaps the most interesting aspect presented in Death of a Salesman is that it does not seem to invite one to sympathize with the characters and their fate, but rather hopes for the audience to observe the struggles of life and use the film's profoundly touching story as a tool for learning and reflection.",7.0,matic-boh1,2014/07/21,0,0
1148,Goodfellas,The Definitive Film of the 1990s,"""GoodFellas"" may be the most important film of the 1990s in the fact that its incredible success led to some of the other great movies of the decade. Films like ""The Silence of the Lambs"", ""The Crying Game"", ""Pulp Fiction"", ""The Usual Suspects"", ""Fargo"", and ""L.A. Confidential"" would have likely never been made as well as they were without the influence of Scorsese's ""GoodFellas"". The film is an intense study of a Mafia family over a 30-year stretch. Ray Liotta plays the half-Irish, half-Sicilian kid from Brooklyn whose only dream is to be a gangster. Although Liotta's story is at the heart of ""GoodFellas"", it is the supporting cast that is the film's calling card. Robert DeNiro gives one of his greatest performances, Paul Sorvino is quietly effective, and Lorraine Bracco (in an Oscar-nominated role) does the best work of her career. However, it is Joe Pesci (in his well-deserved Oscar-winning turn) who steals every scene as the one who does the ""dirty work"". This is probably the definitive film in a decade that produced many film-noir styled classics. 5 stars out of 5.",,tfrizzell,2000/07/21,436,260
1149,Spider-Man 2,One of my Favorite Movies!,"I am gonna get this out of the way. I fricking love this movie! To me, this is the definitive light-hearted superhero movie. It works both as a summer blockbuster and as a sincere, human drama. But why is it so good? Let's take a look and find out! Firstly, the story. While the first Spider-Man was a simple story about a young man who gets super powers and learning to be responsible with them, this film is a lot more complex than that. In this film, Peter is dealing with the struggles of being Spider-Man and having a normal life. Ultimately, his life becomes miserable for him. He can't get a steady job, he's failing his class, he can't pay his rent, and most importantly, he can't get into a relationship with Mary Jane. So he quits being Spider-Man and things start going better for him. He's getting good grades in his class and he can pursue a relationship with Mary Jane. But whenever he sees a crime in progress, he feels really guilty that he can't do anything about it and has to turn the other cheek. Eventually, he becomes Spider-Man again and saves the day and as reward, he gets a chance to be with Mary Jane. What's great about this is that it all feels very human and relatable. We've all been in positions where we want to do something good but isn't getting much out of it. Peter in this film ultimately learns to become Spider-Man again but not because of guilt like in the first film, but because of the responsibility Uncle Ben taught him. It's all very real and human. The villain here is Doc Ock. When this movie first came out, critics raved about how human and sympathetic his character was and I agree completely. He isn't some kind of generic super villain who wants revenge on Spidey or some stupid sh!t like that. He's just a man who lost his wife so the only thing he has to live for is his science experiment. Of course, along the way he does some pretty horrible stuff for this experiment but at the end of the film when Peter tells him what he said to him about intelligence and how it's a gift to be used for the good of mankind. He also tells him how sometimes we have to be steady and give up the thing we want the most. So Doc Ock decides to sacrifice himself at the end to save the city from his experiment. The key theme of this movie is sacrifice and it's expressed beautifully with both the hero and the villain. So there's some really excellent character stuff in this movie but what else is great about it? I think the tone of this movie is perfect. This movie deals with a lot of heavy themes like responsibility, sacrifice, heroism, etc but the tone of this movie never feels too depressing or brooding. It was a huge problem I had with Man of Steel but here, the tone is rather light-hearted and humorous. There's a lot of clever humor in this film that makes the film a really good summer movie experience. I also love the way they made Peter in the beginning of the film. They make him so ridiculously miserable, it's hilarious! It makes the audience sympathize with him well because of how funny it gets. If it was done in a really sappy, tragic way then it would look melodramatic but thankfully, Raimi chose to play it as much for laughs as it is for drama. So you can laugh but still sympathize with Peter in this film. The action scenes in this movie are pretty great too. The one that everyone raves over is the train fight and I agree. The fight choreography here is really quite creative and they take advantage well of all the things Spidey and Ock could do. Overall, Spider-Man 2 is simply one of the best superhero movies out there. It's sincere, it's human, it's funny, it's exciting, and it's surprisingly complex so I am gonna give it a 10/10!",10.0,mrrockey,2013/08/10,15,10
1150,The Chorus,A variation on the theme of inspiring teacher,"Not as common as underdog sports teams overcoming obstacles to achieve success, stories of teachers bucking the odds to great positive effect seem to be perennial favorites. This film about a recently-hired school supervisor, Clément Mathieu, at a French reform school for boys in 1949 is one more entry in the exceptional teacher genre. For many of us the appeal of these films is that we have had such a teacher in our lives. The school, named Fond de l'Etang (literally ""bottom of the pond""), houses an impressive collection of rowdy boys, some orphaned or otherwise scarred by the war. The headmaster is a harsh disciplinarian whereas Clémeant is more gentle and reasoned in his approach. About all you need to know about the story is that, in this particular case, the inspiring teacher accomplishes his noteworthy achievements by way of forming a choir. Not all is sweetness as there is one rather incorrigible boy, Mondain (Grégory Gatignol, who establishes a truly scary presence) introduced into the mix. It is interesting to compare this movie with ""Blackboard Jungle"" where Glenn Ford faces a somewhat similar situation. The gritty realism of ""Blackboard Jungle"" is in stark contrast to what we see in ""Les Choristes,"" leaving one to puzzle about how a Hollywood film from 1955 has more depth than a French film from 2004. Jacques Perrin adds some nice touches in his brief appearances - he does a particularly fine job as an orchestra conductor in an early scene. After Clément whips the choir into shape they perform some stunningly beautiful pieces. Maybe they are unbelievably good, but that does not detract from being able to enjoy their performances. I replayed the last ten minutes of the movie several times just to listen to the chorus. This is a sentimental and predictable film, but nicely done.",8.0,bandw,2007/08/06,2,2

Every parent who takes their kid to Sea World should be required to watch this first. I went to Sea World twice for school functions in high school and I didn't think anything of it. When I look back on it, I am mad that I was put in the position to have to go. I hope this film also changes schools views on field trips (or band trips or drill team trips) to Sea World.

1153,Blackfish,Shamu sham,"Like many I guess, I've seen and considered myself entertained by the sea creatures at Sea World. I was aware of the death of one of the trainers at one of these shows from some years ago but put it down to being an occupational hazard, a tragic but accidental death. This well-made, provocative documentary takes that sad story as its starting point and digs deeper, painting up a tawdry tale of greed, deception and apparent wilful abandonment of care by the named entertainment company, which significantly declined to comment on any of the major accusations lodged here. From the horrible death of the female trainer in 2010, caught on video, but mercifully cut before she is actually killed, the production traces back the story of the only too well named killer whale and its history of previous attacks on other trainers, caused, allegedly by years of mistreatment of the animal. Sea World's part in a similar European tragedy involving the death of a Spanish trainer only adds to the charge sheet. A host of former trainers now recanting their previously parroted company-speak of how well the animals are treated is a particularly effective device, but there's much good detective work besides. Most of all, the film isn't afraid to point the finger at the multimillion dollar corporation Sea World and while I hesitate to come to a judgement without the accused exercising the right of reply, it's hard not to conclude that this was an accident, if that's the correct word, waiting to happen. The film is happy to confine its aim to Sea World alone, but I'm sure I'm not alone in reconsidering my position on the capture and training of animals for our entertainment not only in water parks, but also of course in circuses and zoos. A sad, sobering, look into an unacceptable mode of entertainment which has surely had its day.",8.0,Lejink,2013/10/12,20,16
1154,Spider-Man 2,"Like Everyone, I Think That This Is The Best Superhero Movie EVER! (SPOILERS)","SPOILERS What can I say about this movie that has not already been said? There is one thing that I know a lot of people will agree with me one. 1. This is the best superhero movie ever made. Why? This combines humor with breathtaking action with an all around dark and rich plot. The only problem with the plot is that it is complicated. Also, I know a lot of people will say that this is the best superhero movie ever, and I agree, but this is one of the best sequels of all time too. Sure, Spiderman 1 had everything, but this has everything but also it does everything 10% better. Besides, Doctor Octopus is the best Spiderman villain of all time. He may be evil but you feel sorry for him at the same time, and Alfred Molina did a fantastic job of showing that. I mean, it is the tentacles. They are controlling him and persuade him to turn evil. It is so heartbreaking and disturbing at the same time. Also, there is one scene I have to mention. The Hospital Scene. The hospital scene was just back to the old Evil Dead says, where Sam Raimi was at his peek of showing super terrifying and kind of funny things at the same time. The hospital scene was terrifying and truly showed what the tentacles could do. That was the turning point of the movie. By far one of the most important scenes in the movie. Okay, now that I got all of that off my chest it is time to give the plot. Like I said, this is a bit complicated and hard to fit into words but here it is, the plot. Peter Parker (Spiderman) is finding life as the web-slinger difficult. He tries hard to keep up his education and tries to keep his friends Mary Jane Watson and Harry Osbourne, who thinks Spiderman killed his father. He also invested in Otto Octavius's experiments, which he uses extra arms for a fusion experiment. It goes terribly wrong. The arms, which are super-smart, are fused to his back. His wife, Rosie, is killed also. The arms tell Otto to turn evil and still make the experiment again. Meanwhile, Peter finds out that he can not use his powers as well anymore. He also learns that Mary Jane is getting married. With all the pressure, he gives up Spiderman. He starts to enjoy life without being the web slinger. Doctor Octopus is the meantime has found a warehouse to rebuild his experiment. All he needs left is tritium. He goes to Harry for it. Harry tells him he'll give him tritium if he gets Spiderman, and get Peter to find him. Doc Ock captures Mary Jane to lure Peter into getting Spiderman, or himself. Peter, as Spiderman is captured and given to Harry. Harry is shocked to learn the truth. Peter escapes and gets to the warehouse. After a battle with Doc Ock he becomes good again and Peter persuades him to turn off the machine. He does, but he sacrifices himself doing it. Mary Jane then learns that Peter is Spiderman. Then, at her wedding, Mary Jane leaves it to be with Peter, or, as we all know him, Spiderman. Overall, this is definitely the greatest and the richest superhero movie ever made. I know I mentioned that three times but that is all I can say about this movie. Everyone has already said it and it is so true. Trust me, if you are a fan of Spiderman or a fan of comic books or a fan of having a good time, watch this movie, you will not regret it. Take out the popcorn and just watch. You are definitely in for a ride. 9/10 Recommended Films: Spiderman.",9.0,I_Am_The_Taylrus,2007/05/11,10,7
1155,The Fault in Our Stars,I Saved My 1 For This Film,"I honestly can't imagine how anyone with a sense of good writing, good directing, or good acting could ever think this movie is entertaining past the humor of its flaws. Do you people have brains? These actors may as well have had the script in their hands while shooting. It would have made no difference. The only impressive ""skills"" displayed came when the girl cries after AUGUSTUS (so pretentious)passes away. The only thing that kept me engaged in this movie after I had started watching was the curiosity of which one dies first. There were points when I was rooting for the death of them together just so the movie would end. This review isn't coming from someone heartless. I admit that I teared up when Hazel bawls her eyes out, but that doesn't make the movie good. That just means I sympathize with someone who is crying. That says nothing about the quality of the film. What happened IMDb? I can usually trust your ratings. I've never written a review here before but when I saw that this was higher than an 8, I had to say something. This is a weak tearjerker for the weak-minded.",1.0,khaledalasad,2014/07/27,323,159
1156,The Fault in Our Stars,Would happily see this again!,"Average American guy right here, and I dug this flick. I don't care how many 13 year olds were in the theater with me, this movie has emotion. After watching the Descendents, I knew Woodley was going places. She simply delivers in this movie. I'm not going to write a long winded review about the summary, but I will tell you about the acting. Elgort and Woodley truly deliver. You forget they're acting each and every scene. The chemistry between the two is palpable. Laura Dern comes out of nowhere; I think the last time I've seen her face was JP. She puts up a pretty good role as Woodley's torn mother. Defoe is pure love/hate on almost a House level. In fact, he goes beyond House hatred with his apathy in this movie. And the two's sidekick (Wolff) is loads of comic relief, which is surprising considering that he too is in the therapy group. The rest of the cast is just kind of there (sorry Tramell). But that's because the camera is on Woodley and Elgort the entire time. I don't even think there's a scene except for flashbacks where the two are absent. As far as the movie... An emotional roller-coaster. You will get addicted to their relationship. You will cry big man tears internally (and probably externally) after 1.5 hours. You will be emotionally drained.",8.0,Victreebong,2014/06/12,187,142
1157,The Fault in Our Stars,Watch it only if you would like to wallow in self pity,"----this review may contain spoilers---- This weekend I had an opportunity to watch one of the most disgusting films cinema has to offer and to believe it earned around $286 million has just left me bewildered. The film is an extremely romanticized version of reality and takes on a cathartic display which was supposed to evoke a few tears but ended up doing the opposite(yes,I had a few laughs there). This film in my view is cancer for young minds which inspires you to hold onto fallen ideals. This film is strictly for those with the 'bleeding heart syndrome' very aptly put by the highly revered 'most watched leading man in television history'. The 'metaphor' is strictly a test of your coherence - cigarette in mouth without lighting it up is supposed to be funny or cool or whatever.The film invites ridicule and a certain farcical exuberance could never hurt the creators, but certainly does to the viewers. The movie is definitely aspires to be like its idol a paragon of self pity , yeah you guessed it right 'NICHOLAS SPARKS'.(as if one was not enough) The only character I liked in the film was that of the author brooding,aloof,misanthropic but ruins it all when he shows up at the funeral with a letter in tow. This film has nothing new to offer and is as cheesy as ... well cheese and the fact that this movie will have a bollywood remake .... yeah I saw this coming. I would like to believe that I have given you a fairly ingenious outline as to what this movie brings to the fore.",2.0,shashanksingh609,2014/09/05,14,6
1158,The Fault in Our Stars,The Joy of Life,"I was touched by the concepts and situations on this film, being myself a survivor of 48 chemotherapy treatments, I can somehow understand the feelings. Is not a pretentious film, however full of little moments that creates a very good and convincing environment. I like both main rolls. The story is completely credible, it can happen any time to anyone. It is an Ode for Life, it tell us that ""We can and should have moments of infinite joy within a limited time"" It is our choice! I liked very much this film!",9.0,horacioreyes,2014/06/30,192,145
1159,October Sky,They mostly left out the mother. Unfortunately.,"I don't see how they could have put the whole of this fabulous reminiscence, ""Rocket Boys,"" by a man close to my age, into a movie without making it into a mini-series for young-adults and above. Having just finally read it, I had to re-watch the film, which I'd seen over ten years ago. For those who don't like the movie, read the book, and watch the Bonus extras on the disk. You'll find they did an excellent job of extracting and displaying on screen perhaps 25% of this non-fiction story's elements. What you get is a sweet (not necessarily saccharin, rather ""sweet"" as in well-crafted), feel-good family fare flick, but not the gritty and far more real complete story, which included more characters and conflicts, and especially the interaction between the boy and his mother, and how she balanced out the tough-love family equation. In real life Homer's mother did a lot more than cook, wash, and gripe a bit about the company coal mine as June Lockhart from ""Lassie"" might have done. She could be, and was, scathingly, bitterly, ironically funny in the face of the daily potential for disaster, of the mine killing her husband and setting the family adrift. If the father was a force to be reckoned with, wait'll you meet Homer's actual mother, not the Mrs. Cleaver version they depicted in ""October Sky"" the movie. This is one jumping off place requiring a mini-series, and where the incomparable Laura Dern could have really done some serious work, had they cast her in that role playing opposite Chris Cooper but, this is an inspirational family flick, not reality. In the book, Elsie's got a husband devoted more to managing a deadly company town operation than his own family, an occupation thousands of feet underground, on call 24x7; an eldest son devoting himself to a potentially crippling sport which might or might not get him out of Coalwood WV and the inevitable life underground; and a youngest son who decides he wants to experiment in the basement with potentially deadly projectiles fueled by violently volatile chemical mixtures, testing them in the furnace of the coal-fired hot water heater and drying them out for days underneath it. Her sardonic, ironic response to him when he announces he wants to do this (and a few times thereafter): ""Don't blow yourself up."" As she continually paints an idyllic beach scene on a canvas hanging on the kitchen wall...for several years. Homer could've blown the house up. Brother Jim could've been permanently disabled. Her husband faced death daily (either from black lung or a mine disaster) in which case the company would've given her two weeks to move the family out of Coalwood, who knows where. They didn't hit that one hard enough in this Disney-like film. I give it an 8 for taking a far more serious work and pulling together enough elements to create a good family flick. A movie the whole family can watch together...just not Homer's real family, who were if anything, more dysfunctional than most. Fabulous job of autobiographical writing, great job of movie-making based on it. The one is not entirely the other. That's okay, the movie stands on its own.",8.0,Scott7411,2011/01/20,1,1
1160,Intermission,Too many anti-gay comments ruined it for me,"Say what you will about anti-gay comments just being used to show how bigotted a character is, it ruins my enjoyment of a movie when one of the ""good guys"" of the film (as in ""Intermission"") uses them freely. You'd never hear this many anti-black or anti-Jewish or anti-Moslem or anti-anything comments in any movie. I am disappointed that Colin Farrell appeared in a film with so many anti-gay comments when his own brother is gay. Some men decide to pull off a crime, and we are expected to empathize with them. I have empathized with people pushed into doing things they wouldn't ordinarily do, but these characters are not facing dire circumstances, and their decisions to commit crimes are based on nothing. The film itself is quite pointless and useless, even if it does feature some good performances and moments. Why make a film that has no point and then include gratuitous hate comments that demoralize a fair chunk of the population?",1.0,pyotr-3,2004/05/10,27,7
1161,Primal Fear,"Three outstanding performances/characters (or ""four?"")","Edward Norton's debut was outstanding in this film, and his work since has confirmed his substantial talent. Richard Gere was equally-proficient in his role as the big-shot defense attorney defending Norton's seemingly hapless ""Aaron."" And Laura Linney - although in a role with less screen-time, was also equal in her performance as the prosecutor, and Gere's courtroom opposition and former lover. The supporting roles were well-cast and played, and perhaps the only criticism to be given would be some brief sub-plot elements which weren't necessary to the main story, but really didn't detract from it significantly. This film provides an excellent combination of courtroom- and psycho-drama - each excellent in its own right, and superb together in this presentation's plot. Gripping, thoroughly-enjoyable entertainment.",9.0,caa821,2007/02/17,18,15
1162,Blackfish,Sad but true.,"After personally watching killer whales perform at Sea World, I now feel nothing but shame and guilt after watching this documentary. The human performers are reading from a script, and were basically as mislead as the public was concerning the treatment and health of these magnificent creatures, but nothing could be further from the truth. This is an extremely important film, and should be shown to all the children of the world truly concerned with these mistreated animals, their part in the natural ecology of the planet, and perhaps even more importantly, to learn about the corporate criminals who destroyed these wonderful animals strictly for corporate profit.",10.0,robert-259-28954,2016/04/26,3,3
1163,Taxi Driver,Probably the most uncomfortable I've ever felt watching a movie.,"Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver is famous and infamous for a lot of reasons. Questions over whether or not Travis is a lunatic, an intelligent cunning man who knows what he wants, or a depressed man trying to gain revenge on a world that doesn't like him and which he doesn't like in return ( I personally believe it's the third one) or the countless theories that the ending is a dream sequence/ a hint he's a violent ticking time bomb that will strike again as a hero or the villain he originally attended to go out as. But what stuck me the most about the movie was his characteristics. You see, when I first started watching the movie, I got a sense that the intelligent, observant, insightful man Travis was trying to show to world, and by extension the audience was full of crud. Why? Because I act and lash out the same way as he does. The projection he lays out to Betsy explaining to her that ""all the telephones in her office doesn't hide her loneliness"" , his uncalled for criticism of her coworker, his obsession to Betsy bleeding into his lust to kill the senator. These are all things I can see myself doing I've tried to convince myself and other romantic interests of how sophisticated I am when in reality I don't stand by anything. Notice how Travis has no interest in politics but yet tries to act as if he has any interest in what his significant other is passionate about in order to impress her. But when she asks him basic questions of his policies, his mask cracks. He has the charisma to breeze over the questions but that still doesn't excuse the fact that this is a man without a true identity. All he knows is hate. Hatred for how Betsy treated him, hatred for his fellow taxi drivers acceptance of the destructiveness that happens around them, hatred towards Sports manipulation of Iris. All he wants to do is push his pain and hatred to other people. This is the only reason he planned to kill the senator. He just wanted Betsy to feel what he was feeling. He's no hero: everything he did was selfish and it was for himself. He never wanted to be seen as anything or condemned/ praised for his actions. He just wanted to cause misery and die. His ""saving"" of Iris wasn't even wanted by her: he only did it so he can feel accomplished in completing a mission that will, in his mind, will lead him to die from the gangsters or through suicide. He fails and he's left to suffer again. It's almost as if the film is warning me over my self destructive behavior. My treatment of women is similar to that of Travis albeit a lot less violent and extreme. However the consequences can still be as dire. Loneliness, suffering, and self hatred manifested in a lust to cause others the same pain. I am grateful of how Robert was able to portray a depressed and isolated man in a such a believable and terrifying manner. Everything from his snide tone to his devilish smirk leads to one of the greatest performances I have ever had the privilege of watching. I absolutely detest and hate all of the characters in the movie, especially Travis, but to me that's only because of how personal this story feels to me. It surely is a masterpiece of a movie and I highly recommend watching it. 10/10",10.0,batmanorgiants,2019/07/22,4,3
1164,Intermission,Funniest of 2004 as of may 1!,"Though originally skeptical of an irish film, and of any movie with colin ferrel, i was rolling in the aisles laughing during this movie. I have yet to see a more gritty, perverselly funny movie since snatch.Colm Meaney is just brilliant, and so is colin ferrel(surprisingly). There are several sub plots that are so wildly incoherent, but somehow, the writer brings every subplot together by the end of the film. Bits about moustaches, brown sauce in tea, and everyday life working in a supermarket all eventually come together to craft an intesely funny film, and though its incoherency in the beginning of the movie may seem, well, incoherent, it pulls together to become genious.

1165,Moon,Outstanding Sci-Fi thriller that will make you think,"Let me explain to you what a great movie Moon is: Some movies are great because of the supporting cast. Some have tremendous soundtracks that set the tone for every scene. Some have perfectly timed and well executed hilarious gags. Moon has none of these. The cast is made up of five total people on camera, plus the voice of Kevin Spacey via computer. Sam Rockwell plays Sam Bell, a man contracted to mine the moon for precious resources that are shipped back to Earth, providing 70% of our planet's energy. He is nearing the end of his three year contract, and cannot wait to make the return trip to our blue marble and see his wife and daughter. As he prepares to come home, with under two weeks left, he suddenly starts having some strange hallucinations and his mind plays tricks on him. His lunar rover crashes, and when he returns to base, he meets another person who looks and sounds just like him. I'm going to stop summarizing the movie here, to avoid SPOILERS, though a few may trickle in. I haven't seen any of Rockwell's other movies, to the best of my knowledge, but I can assure you that this is his finest performance. He is in every scene since he is the only living person on the moon. Spacey does an adequate job as the helpful computer, devoid of personality. All of the computer's lines are delivered via a stoic smiley-face image, which adds a touch of humor. The film has a budget of approximately $5 million, but it does more with that amount than others do with $200 million. The base is well constructed, and the outside shots of the rovers and miners on the surface look very professional and like the work of ILM or something similar. SPOILERS RESUME NOW The scenes where Rockwell has to interact with the other Sam are excellent. The timing is spot on, and they don't try to cheat it with tricky camera shots and such. They fight, high- five, and carry each other in various scenes. The plot really gets going and touches on corporate greed, cloning, and various conspiracies, large and small. It is not difficult to follow, but the film doesn't hold your hand and show you everything. You do have to make some assumptions and think for yourself. And like all great sci-fi films, the ending provides us with a true hero who's last choices and actions put a perfect bow on the total package. Moon is similar to Cast Away, but there is no second setting, such as the shipping plant or Tom Hanks' house. No, the entire movie takes place on the moon, and the entire movie is excellent. Be patient with this film and enjoy this Oscar-worthy tale of suspense and action. Ten out of ten.",10.0,answerguy19,2009/08/02,10,5
1166,Intermission,Irish film industry finally starting to 'get it'...,"This is a very enjoyable movie. The most fun i've had with an Irish movie since The Commitments. It's got the right balance of grit and cheese. It's tone and accent is very Irish but the pacing and style is fairly slick and American. Well, slick and American in a low budget independant sense. It's got the feel of one of those hip, cocky Sundance movies, but set in Tallaght! The opening scene with Colin Farrell is great, playing against the audience perception of him from his previous roles. For the next 20mins we're introduced to a bunch of other characters. There is a lot of characters to keep track of here, but you never really get too confused cuz they're played by some of the best Irish talent around and all make there own seperate little impacts. The characters are likeable and for the most part fairly realistic. I was surprised how good David Wilmot and Deirdre OKane turned out. I wasn't expecting them to have such standout roles. Cillian Murphy felt slightly miscast, he's a little too good looking to be totally convincing as a loser working in a supermarket. Colm Meany is hilarious, as a vain cop who's watched a few too many episodes of NYPD Blue or Starsky and Hutch. His obsession with the music of Clannad is one of the best running gags in the movie. The credibilty of certain situations gets a little stretched towards the end though, tying things up a little too neatly. However most of the time the script moved at such a fast pace and with enough laughs that i wasn't really bothered by most of these problems. I have to mention Mark O Rowe, the writer. He's quite well known as a playwright in Dublin and he certainly has is own recognisable and unique style of dialogue. In his plays he invents his own slang or exaggerates actual street slang til it sounds incredibly poetic, a bit like A Clockwork Orange. This word play is present in Intermission although it's toned down quite a bit. He throws an interesting-tongue-twister piece of dialogue in there every now and again and it's refreshingly original. ""a fair few quids to be made cash-wise."" There's also plenty of his eccentric little touches; the scumbag kid trying to get on TV, the wheelchair guy on the floor drinking his Guinness with a straw, the brown sauce in the tea! Overall, a very enjoyable movie, especially if you're Irish, but it should play well in England too.

At times I wanted to see Ferris pull off this grand scheme and at other times he seemed so smug I wanted him to fail. No one should have it that good.

1168,The Wailing,very few movies have shaken me from deep inside,"This will be the first review i'm writing, Because i'm enthralled by this piece of art. Gokseong is directed by Hong-jin Na who previously have made very fine movies like yellow sea and chaser. But the setting of this movie is different from those movies, It kind of felt like Memories of Murder in darker tone. This is the story of a village, where people are suffering from a mysterious diseases which seems like some kind of virus and this ends up killing them, and in the middle of somewhere a Japanese stranger seems to be involved in this. Now, i'm not going to say more than that about the story , and i suggest you to not watch the trailer which doesn't do justice to the movie and stay away from any possible spoiler. It is one of the best horror movies i have seen in long time, it doesn't have jump scares. But what this movie does, it slowly grows on you, you will be confused, conflicted, disgusted while watching this. Somewhere you will make a choice, a perspective to the way things are going and possibly will be wrong. So i strongly suggest you to watch this movie if possible in a secluded environment and if possible alone.

1169,Crash,"Just about the most ham-fisted, beat-you-over-the-head-with-unsubtlety movie in history","I saw Crash the other day. It features Matt Dillon as a corrupt cop who finger f**ks a black woman who he's frisking during an illegal search. Later, he heroically saves the same woman from a fiery death in an overturned automobile. Brilliant. Then there's a touching scene in which Ludicrous, a depraved thug, steals a van only to find out after having driven some distance that there are a dozen Cambodian refugees being smuggled in the back. While barreling down a dingy road in a bad part of town, the previously Machiavellian gangster has a sudden moral epiphany, and realizes what he must do in the name of truth. He cinematically furrows his brows and exhales with a sense of firmness and resolution, stopping the van on a scary LA sidestreet spattered with blood stains and graffiti. He opens the rear van doors to let out the frightened refugees, and with the gusto of a young boy releasing a box of caged pigeons, he gestures excitedly towards the streets as if to say, ""Go, my friends! You are free now, and the world is at your command!"" The huddled mass of refugees and their shivering children cautiously but thankfully exit the van, inhaling the sweet nectar of their newfound freedom, where they are free to roam the dark streets of a large metropolitan city where they have no money, can't speak the language, and have no place to live. Of course, you as the audience member, aren't supposed to think about that. Instead, you are treated to a heartwarming closeup of Ludicrous smiling and nodding his head knowingly. Implicit in this ham-fisted and nonsensical tale is that this hardened criminal now walks the path of righteousness in a city where corruption has otherwise strangled all semblance of humanity. I was stunned by this ridiculous display, and quickly scanned the audience to determine whether everyone else in the theater was as baffled by this scene as I was. Instead I found many theater patrons fighting back tears. Jesus Christ.",2.0,Voivod-2,2009/02/26,14,10
1170,Blackfish,Best documentary I've ever seen,"This film explores the hidden (yet obvious) dangers of working with animals that belong in the wild, the context of my use of the word ""hidden"" is to portray the lengths SeaWorld go to to shield the public eye from what is actually happening to these animals, & when things have gone wrong. When one of their most experienced trainers is killed working with one of the animals an enquiry is held into finding out what happened, a resulting court case follows, whereby SeaWorld always maintain that it is, in someway, the trainers fault. What shocked me the most, other than the conditions these animals are housed in, is the lies - the fabrication of facts about these animals, the fake perception that the animals are happy in their surroundings, how they are housed with their families. All lies. The footage of the incidents will genuinely shock you, you will feel angry & sad that this is happening &, like me, you will struggle to understand how this is still happening.

Woodley and Elgort star as teenagers with cancer who meet in a support group, make friends fast and fall in love in this somewhat predictable and flat-footed adaptation based on the best-selling novel by John Green (surprising since the writing team of Scott Neustadter and Michael H.

Admittedly I have not read the source material yet having said that this film in no way makes me eager to seek it out as a 'must read sensation' no thanks to some pretentious, teeth-grinding dialogue and Elgort's way-too-look-on-the-brightside-smug/jerky Romeo to the otherwise well-portrayed Woodley's Juliet.

1174,Moon,Dull and implausible,"The screenplay for ""Moon"" plays out like a college student's first draft of a film script - where they make the mistake of thinking that they're writing a deep psychological piece by pitting a man's clone against himself. (Episodes of the old Star Trek handled this concept with far more aplomb, and in only one hour.) College student screenwriters also often make the classic error of believing that it's easier to write a script with only a few characters (in this case, just one), when in fact it is much harder. The truth is, two identical personalities stuck in a room is just as boring as it sounds, Sam Rockwell's game try aside. What this movie desperately needed was a lead character who was actually interesting, and interesting dialogue for him to say. Then there's the general implausibility of having a large army of clones developed and waiting to service a single space mining operation... wouldn't it just be easier and cheaper to AUTOMATE the whole base and not force a human (or clone) to run the place? (If Gertie was competent enough to take care of the dozens of sleeping clones in the basement, wouldn't he, or some other machines like him, be competent enough to manage the mining operation?)

1175,Moon,Our Culture is Erasing Itself,"When you want to make a science fiction film, and you are obviously aware from the moment you start that you have watched Solaris and 2001 fifty times, you would think one would contemplate that out of respect you should stop there. I'm not a purist. I don't mind a revisit to a genre. However, those two films hit the things we needed, and it takes much more than the little ideas in moon to make for a movie even half-worth an homage. Our current generation of 20 year olds did not grow up watching 2001 or Solaris, so there is no frame of reference to catch this film and throw it directly onto a late night broadcast on the sci-fi channel -which is where it belonged back in 1985 when we weren't watching MTV. It's a damned shame film. Shame on these ""filmmakers"". Good grief. And, shame of some of the best reviewers, not excluding Roger Ebert himself, for not taking a blazing torch out and screaming for the negative of that film to be strung out for all to see. Neither Kubrick nor Tarkovsky would be stirring in their graves. They would in fact rise from the dead, take the director out for a night of heavy drinking, and then swat his bottom before putting him to bed and handing him a mini dv camera, telling him to spend the rest of his life video taping traffic. It's okay to make a movie that takes place in space. It really is. But, if you're going to do it, start from scratch, not from theft.",1.0,benkuchera,2010/04/25,90,38
1176,Primal Fear,wow,"The art of the good suspense film often seems lost, but Primal Fear manages to grasp that art and milk it for all it's worth. For start to finish, it offers a brand of ""hold your breath""-ness that really grabs you and squeezes. As an actor, Edward Norton (Aaron/Roy) never ceases to amaze me. He's different in everything I see him in, and this is no exception. To see him morph from mild-mannered alter boy Aaron into terrorizing Roy and back again is something that makes you think, ""If I were in Richard Gere's place, I'd be afraid for my life."" Definitely a show-stealing performance.",10.0,MdnightRadio7L,2001/04/22,5,4
1177,The Green Mile,Terrible,"I believe I am alone in my dislike of this movie. In fairness, the acting and cinematography are excellent. That said, the story and directing of the characters was extremely problematic for me. Here we have this man who has an incredible gift to heal others and the audience looks on in amazement as he performs miracles but at no time do the characters on screen seem freaked out, excited, or exhibit any emotion other than ""Hey lookey what he can do. Let's get him to cure my wife."" That ruins the whole picture for me because it was no longer believable. If I witnessed such visually stunning miracles(stuff coming from the mouth etc.) I would be telling everyone I knew, calling scientists, papers, etc. The other characters also didn't seem too hurt that they were going to execute an innocent man. Unbelievable! Especially an innocent man with extraordinary powers. In the real world many fight to keep real killers on death row alive and spare their lives but nobody fights for this man.

1180,The Wailing,An interesting horror with squandered potential,"I watched The Wailing on the back of strong critical response, a rarity for horror films. Unfortunately I was left a little conflicted. The film's premise is a mix of tropes (possession, good vs. evil, religious mythology), and its slow-burn narrative is set in a relatively poor, rural village in South Korea. The tone the movie strikes at first is one of slapstick and black-comedy. The local police are incompetent, unfit and seemingly terrified of everything. I laughed quite a few times throughout. We get little character development; these aren't complicated people. The lead protagonist, Jong-goo, has about as much depth as a petri dish, and - work-shy and cowardly - doesn't inspire much sympathy. Then there's a jarring tonal shift towards seriousness. Seeing Jong-goo distraught over the mystery sickness his daughter is plagued by didn't move me at all, because the goings-on up until that point had been dealt with so flippantly and the characters were painted as comic foils contrasting with the horrific murders. Why would we care about what's happening to these people, when they've been painted as two- dimensional and foolish? The film's final half-an-hour redeemed it somewhat. I'd predicted the twist that the Japanese man was wrongly vilified and was trying to save the village, so when the shaman confirmed it, I was disappointed by how obvious it had been. But then it turned out to be a bluff! Which took me by surprise. He's evil after all. The ending was particularly strong; tragic, but poignant, with some allegorical revelations. The characters make some strange decisions throughout. Why, when Jong-goo discovered the Japanese man had a shrine with photographs of the recent village murders, did he, his colleague and the deacon simply run off? Bring the man in for questioning at least. Get his DNA. Do some actual police work. And why, if the Japanese man was a malevolent being, did he not offer some excuse to put Jong-goo et al off the scent? He made no effort to mislead them (beyond using the shaman), even when there was every opportunity to lie or distract Jong-goo each occasion they confronted him on the top of the mountain. The benevolent ghost Moo-myeong could've made everything clear early on if she'd been less ambiguous - instead she drip-fed pieces of information to Jong-goo, all too late. If she actually wanted to save the village, she could've easily done it. When characters act in improbable or irrational ways in order to confuse the audience so the revelation is a surprise, that's lazy writing in my opinion. To me, this seems like this was just to force ambiguity so we weren't sure who was trustworthy or not, who was 'real' or not. So it's a mixed bag of a movie. The positives are the setting, the basic plot and the pacing. The negatives are the tonal shifts, the shallow characters, some of the writing. There's a gem hidden in there somewhere, I just think it could've shone brighter if handled differently.",6.0,rumour-mill,2017/08/07,7,4
1181,The Chorus,An unlikely but charming transition of bad boys into angelic choir,"Les Choristes is a triumph of wish-fulfilment, and director/writer Christophe Barratier wastes little time on the process that should be at the heart of the film: how to turn a class of very difficult boys into a trained choir with no support at all from the principal's office. It's a heart-warming, feel-good yarn with great performances from everyone, but anyone with experience in education is going to have to suspend their disbelief from the ceiling, as newbie teacher M. Mathieu (Gérard Jugnot) effortlessly transitions from getting the tykes to chirp out snippets of naughty ditties to faultlessly harmonising Rameau before the school governors. Somewhere in the middle there, about half an hour of exposition is missing, in which Mathieu has to chuck out recalcitrant brats, knock heads together, and dish out lines. However, as I say, this is wish-fulfilment; we're in an imaginary past that should not be mistaken for today's reality. As fairy-tales go, this is wonderfully put together, and was a sure-fire box-office hit in France, where French womanhood could not fail to fall for all the lads and sing along with their divine music. Everybody wants to believe this kind of educational miracle is possible, and I am not going to disillusion them on this board. Seven for pure escapism.",7.0,rowmorg,2009/09/20,0,0
1182,Horrible Bosses 2,Bulls-eye,"Horrible Bosses II is funnier than the original film. That's unusual for a sequel, but what a relief. Along with an excellent cast, Bateman, Day and Sudeikis made this sequel for all the right reasons. Every few minutes I was laughing out loud. This well executed, politically incorrect caper movie hits the comedy bulls-eye. Jason Bateman has so paid his actor's dues since having to take such schlock roles as Ray in Will Smith's 2008 'Hancock'. As in his absolute 2013 gem, Bad Words, Bateman nails the comic timing along with his ensemble buddies, Charlie Day and Jason Sudeikis. These are three comedy actors at the top of their game. Their riffing is exquisitely funny and relentless. It's done without falling into indulgences so often seen from their contemporaries. And Day's stressed, high pitched voice, like the story, is naturally hilarious. What I also liked is the fact that this story takes enough risks to allow ideas to be resolved in unpredictable and unexpected ways. Big thumbs up to Director Seth Gordon and the writers for giving us a genuinely, sustainedly funny film.",9.0,diogenes-858-449167,2015/02/13,27,14
1183,Taxi Driver,Why This Film is a Classic is a Profound Mystery,"Martin Scorsese is one of those directors whose work I just don't seem to get. His films are not totally inaccessible, like most of the work of Stanley Kubrick, but sitting through a Scorsese production is often an exercise that pendulums back and forth between crashing boredom and utter incomprehensibility. Of course, everyone knows by now that TAXI DRIVER is about isolation. Specifically the isolation of one man in the midst of a bustling city. Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro), a Viet Nam veteran, applies for a job driving a taxi in New York on the graveyard shift; the reason he gives for wanting the job is that he does not sleep at night. That anyone would hire him to actually drive a vehicle under those conditions seems odd, but then everything about Bickle is odd. Clearly he suffers from a profound sense of isolation, but most of that is of his own making, since when it comes to social interaction this guy is so clueless that he makes burnout Reverend Jim from the television show ""Taxi"" seem like Albert Einstein by comparison. Travis finds himself attracted to Betsy, a woman working on the presidential campaign of a politician (Cybill Shepherd, proving yet again that she cannot act her way out of a cream puff factory), and he has sufficient social skills to get her to agree to a movie date. Then he takes her to a XXX porn film. Of course she cannot get out of there fast enough, and he is totally bewildered; in his mind it was a perfect date movie. A good deal of the story is told via Travis's inner thoughts, spoken by De Niro on the soundtrack. This device was old even in 1976, and there is too much of it; the audience is already alienated from this man, and having his thoughts overdubbed places him even farther from anything remotely approaching understanding. Possibly the best scenes in the movie are the ones with Jodie Foster as Iris, a twelve-year-old prostitute whom Travis attempts to rescue from what he sees as a sordid life. Iris is possibly the most interesting person in the film; Foster plays her as a girl walking a tightrope between what she has to do to survive and the necessity to avoid danger; she is receptive to Travis at first, but even a twelve-year-old can see that this guy is not playing with a full deck. And at least she breathes some life into an unbearably tedious movie. Which brings us to De Niro. He's good here, but he's much better elsewhere; watching him I had the impression that Scorsese went to one of two extremes: either he gave the actor no direction at all and let him do as he pleased, or he micromanaged every nuance of the character and in the process sucked the life out of it. Whatever, the result is a stilted and peculiar bit of acting that seems beneath a major talent like De Niro. Yes, we get Travis's isolation, but we never know what caused it, or why he is just so damn WEIRD. And of course, as is Scorsese's habit, all of this is presented under the guise of ""gritty reality"" (think GOODFELLAS and RAGING BULL, both of which ram ""gritty reality"" down the viewer's throat until the urge to run screaming from the theater is almost overwhelming). I am a native of New York City; I was born there and lived there until I was forty-two. Martin Scorsese is also a native of the City, but I do not recognize the picture of NYC he paints in this film at all. The simple answer is that we are seeing the City through Travis Bickle's eyes, but while he describes what he sees, we never find out WHY he sees things the way he does; it is perhaps the most frustrating aspect of a very frustrating film. Great film? Depends on which critic you ask. The late Roger Ebert loved it. Leonard Maltin thinks it's awful. I suspect that, like most of Scorsese's oeuvre, this is one of those movies you either love or you hate. Well, I didn't exactly HATE it, but most of it is insufferably boring. De Niro presents us with a wacko character but fails to provide a provenance for his behavior. About the only good thing I can say about Cybill Shepherd is that her role is brief; she's absolutely PAINFUL to watch. It is only Jodie Foster, all of twelve years old yet wearing an ancient expression in her eyes that tells the story of where this girl has been, that draws and holds the audience's attention; honestly, without Foster the film would have no life at all. And possibly the worst of it is that Bickle's increasing descent into violence is left totally unexplained. It would be easy to assume that it was his Viet Nam service that unhinged him, but the movie does not play that way and at any rate if that were the case it would have been an easy matter to communicate it. To put it in five short words, this film is a mess.",1.0,ScottAmundsen,2013/06/18,167,92
1184,Spider-Man 2,"Definitively, one of the best in its genre.","The sequel to the Spider-Man movie is everything a fan of the first could ask for. Imagine the surprise to see such care, effort and appreciation put into every character within the movie, with excellent acting, direction, sound, computer animation... all of it seamlessly integrated into a film that is very aware of the history, the fandom, and the expectations associated with the Spider-Man franchise. Spider-Man 2 is the perfect film for the comic book genre, and the perfect sequel for Spider-Man fans. Aside from the flawless animation and choreography staged between the Spider-Man/Doctor Octopus fights, we get to the real core of Peter Parker, when he makes a real attempt back at normal life, after events allow him so. Seeing Peter Parker deal with day-to-day life honestly, in an environment unintentionally nudging against him in all areas, makes this film a real gem, and Tobey Maguire should give himself a pat on the back for what a good film he's put together. While Peter Parker deals with him losing a job, failing school, missing rent and straining to meet Mary Jane at the cost of being Spider-Man, an idol of his, Dr. Otto Octavius, whom his very project is on, receives sponsorship from his friend, Harry, to work his experiment on fusion. After the experiment goes horribly wrong, Octavius loses control of his senses and plots to finish his job no matter the cost. One of the best scenes has to be when Peter comes clean to Aunt May about what really happened to Uncle Ben. Here, the script and director could have done anything to make the scene anything else but what it was but they didn't. Those types of scenes, included along with relating to Mary Jane and saving whatever he kept holding onto with her, worked because of the exceptional acting and direction involved in knowing that they were creating a great film. Spider-Man 2 is one of the best sequels of all time, and if you loved the first movie, the second will not disappoint. Everyone involved in this film, should give themselves a hand because Spider-Man 2 lived up to its namesake as a film that you could enjoy over and over and never tire of. Every scene is never wasted, and I give the film two thumbs way up for ingenuity and imagination, for bringing the web-crawling hero a greater movie than one could think possible.",9.0,The_Orenda,2007/10/31,11,8

This was an outstanding movie and in my eyes should of got more recognition and probably the Best Picture of 2011. Adrian Brodys deserved a nomination for his performance as a substitute teacher who does not want a full time gig because he does not want to be emotionally attached to his students. He shows real raw emotion in his position. I just want to say props to the director who did an outstanding job not trying to be too artsy and trying to make all viewers happy instead of one group of viewers.

1187,Moon,Fabulous film,"I saw this last night and it was fabulous. It's hard to discuss for fear of giving away any spoilers but I'll try. I thought it a magnificent film and when compared to the bloated, nonsensical 'lets have more pointless explosions' of Transformers 2 it shows that you can still have such thought, style and cleverness in a film for a fraction of the budget. Normally with the independent art-house films they are set on Glaswegian council estates. If remotely sci-fi they are almost forced to have a horror - sex element to help them sell to the teen market. This was so refreshing for demonstrating genuine craft and story telling. A film that even as your mind is racing ahead to predict the typical ABC outcome of film, manages to keep surprising you. There were no silly twists or WTF moments to make up for the writers lack of logic and it offered a subject matter that resonated with you long after. Sam's performance was stellar but it is frustrating that one can't elaborate for fear of giving stuff away. I know the film didn't have a big cinema push, well certainly not in the UK, and was only out to piggy back the anniversary of the lunar landings, but I really hope it gets some more exposure. Sam deserves recognition for his talent as does the writer and director. I've enjoyed some good films this year but that was certainly the freshest, most inventive and well executed one that I've seen so far.",9.0,Paynebyname,2009/07/31,31,21

The part where he was in the parade cracked me up, especially Twist and Shout, aka the #1 Beatles song. Obviously John Hughes (the director and co-producer) think alike.

1189,Spider-Man 2,Spider-Man rocks!,"Spider-Man 2 is one of the best super hero movies ever. Peter Parker is still dealing with the dichotomy with being a super-hero. He loves and hates it at the same time. On the one hand, he realizes ""with great power comes great responsibility,"" but he still wants his own life. It seems that every promise made to others he cares about is broken because of his self-imposed ""responsibility."" He cannot hold a job because he felt compelled to stop a robbery. He misses Mary Jane's play for a similar occasion. Adding insult to injury, is the fact that his powers are misfiring. He keeps losing his mastery of equilibrium, he cannot stick to walls, and he cannot sling his web. Frustrated, he packs up being Spider-Man. But is it for the best? At the same time, Doctor Octavius is trying to show Peter Parker the mastery of fusion power. It could solve the world's energy problem, mostly by copying the power of the sun. His robotic arms used to control the experiment fuse with his spinal cord and brain functions, giving the scientist a split personality. Now, he is controlled by the artificial intelligence of his robotic arms. Doc Ock needs a special element to continued his experiments. Only a vindictive Harry Osborne has. Since he wants Spider-Man dead, Doc Ock has to kill Spidey to get his precious metal. At the outset, this movie does so well in giving us super-heroes who we care about. The characters and story do not take precedence over the special effects. Director Sam Raimi does well in making Mary Jane, Harry Osborne, Peter Parker, and even Aunt May believable as real people. This is probably the best strength. We identify with them because they have the same problems we do. Aunt May cannot meet mortgage requirements, Peter can't pay rent, Harry turns to alcohol after an abysmal failure, and Mary Jane is frustrated with Peter's lack of commitment. Probably the best scene that shows this believability is when Peter confides in Aunt May. In fact, I think Rosemary Harris does a fantastic job, giving this background character real strength. I also liked the way Doc Ock was given some depth and intrigue. As a villain, he is smart, powerful, and strong. Even more intriguing is how he meets his demise, which will surprise the audience. However, the action and special effects are the topping on the cake. The fight scenes between Spidey and Doc Ock are incredibly fantastic, giving such intricate detail that will even wow a CGI specialist. One of those involves Spidey trying to save Aunt May from Doc Ock atop a high building. A better scene involves the two opponents fighting atop a moving elevated train. In any case, Spider-Man 2 is the best of the series, and probably the best super-hero movie ever ... so far.",9.0,scott-sw,2008/02/19,6,5

1191,Crash,Crash is a Wreck,"In Crash, Director Paul Haggis goes Altmanesque with this garbled attempt to discuss bigotry in contemporary LA. Overall it lacks Altman's energy and offers up gross cliché characters instead of quirky originals. Crash begins to go into its spin right after Detective Weathers (Don Cheadle) sums up the ""City of Angels"" populace in the first line of the film. ""In LA nobody touches you. We're all behind glass and metal. Sometimes I think we crash into each other just so we can feel something."" We are then introduced to a full cast of impatient, ill tempered Angelinos of all stripe and persuasion connected in some way to make life miserable for each other. There's the bigoted cop, the successful ""Uncle Tom"" black, the Asian trafficking in human cargo, the hard working Latino, the misunderstood Persian and gang banger of principle. It's LA as a microcosm of the world, Hollywood style. The enemy is ourselves seems to be the message as Crash's one dimensional characters snarl at each other from start to finish with occasional moments of insight and exposed vulnerability as they spend scene after scene reciting well worn bigoted archaisms that have been around for decades. When Haggis runs out of these he goes into music video mode with a solemn track playing over a montage of Crash's hapless citizens looking dutifully glum. Serious as it attempts to be Crash is a rather vapid message picture with a couple of incendiary scenes connected by preposterous coincidence that patronizes its token cast when its not busy spitting stilted racist venom. It's a five car pile-up.",4.0,st-shot,2007/11/25,27,18

I highly enjoy this film and is yet another brilliant role played by Adrian Brody, quite possibly his best role and story since ""The Pianist."" The supporting cast was also great. My opinion on this film may be biased, solely on the fact that I only enjoy films that touch the heart and soul (or at least makes me think/feel) and this is one film that made me want to go out and change the world for the better.

1195,The Wailing,One hell of a ride,"This movie was a hell of a ride. About 40 minutes into the movie, I stopped to look at how much time was left and was actually RELIEVED to see that there was still so much left. That's how engaging and interesting the story was for me. Before watching the movie I read one review on here that said it was a ""smorgasbord"" of genres (it was a positive review), but it doesn't really feel like it. I mean, yes, I can see it, but the storytelling is so fluid and well written that the multiple genre aspects didn't feel out of place at all. It works. It works so well that I almost feel like it's redundant to point out that there are ""so many genres."" I found the second half of this movie quite similar to The Witch. Not necessarily in terms of the storyline, but the pace, the severity, the terror. Both movies are quite psychological. But The Wailing delivers somewhat of a more complex storyline. Cinematography was breathtaking. Jun Kunimura was ridiculous (in an oh-so-good way). All the actors were on point. I'm not going to point out or mention ""Asian horror"" here (although, technically I just did I guess, lol).

1196,October Sky,A film that hits close to home....,"""October Sky"" is a film that will steal your heart, fill your mind with vivid imagery, and lift your spirit. The tale of Homer Hickham and his dream of creating a rocket seem so simple at first, especially when the film is set in a mining town, where the future is as clear cut as the lumps of coal in the mine. But Homer cannot follow in his father's footsteps. With the encouragement of Miss Riley,(a friendly teacher), members of his father's staff, and his friends, Homer attempts to make his dream a reality. Yet as in any true to life story, there are many stops along the way. Director Joe Johnston lowers us into the coal mines, where we witness the chilling plight of miners stooped beneath a ceiling of rock. With lit helmets and bent posture, they resembled alien insectoids more than humans in the darkness. The hacking coughs of the miners and the blackened faces were a constant reminder of the danger the miners faced in their work. Contrasting the mine shaft's lugubrious load are the images of Homer and his friend's rocket launches. Underneath the blue bowl of sky, rockets are placed upon a pad and launched into the stratosphere...And nothing can match the scene when Homer sees Sputnik for the first time. Yet what makes the film so endearing is the relationship between the characters. Homer's father is a classic hardened man...but he has a soft side as well. We see that he does love his son, despite their many arguments. The love and support of Miss Riley is evident as well. Best of all, the film is uncomfortable. It doesn't tie everything up in a nice bow. It tears at you, lifts you up. It keeps an air of reality, which is important in a film like this. This film can be considered a complete work. At first, I was disappointed that the film did not continue with Homer's life. I didn't want it to end. Then I realized...that's what a good film does to a person. If it has done its job, you won't want it to end. And ""October Sky"" accomplishes just that.",9.0,Jolie,1999/02/07,147,142
1197,Horrible Bosses 2,"Not Good - ""Horrible Bosses"" Sequel is Lackluster","This movie was a broken attempt at trying to ease out any storyline that the previous ""Horrible Bosses"" had. The storyline was vague and relied too much on characters established in the prequel to this movie. The first one was better, though not by far. Any humor in this movie was due to characters saying lewd things, and that got old quickly. The best part of the movie was their final plot, in which the three former employees of different jobs plotted to get the money they needed to start a fledgling business. The plan was far-fetched, but how they executed it was mildly entertaining. This movie was suspended entirely by the ticket price of the last ""Horrible Bosses."" The movie provided little incentive to care deeply about the characters, as they were mostly hollow. The last movie had a better storyline. One of the other parts that was mildly funny was when the three main characters stole laughing gas from a dentist's office, and then in a mishap, opened the gas-containing cylinder, and gassed themselves out. But a vague story emerged on what happened to them afterward, hinging on the fact that there was a psycho waiting to frame them for the crime they had (and hadn't) committed. The movie was disappointing overall, though not much was expected from this sequel to an already bad performance.

1198,Death of a Salesman,great adaption of a novel,"I had to read death of a salesman for a modern writers class, and reading plays arent my cup of tea. i can read books, but i cant stand reading plays. i watched the scarlet letter, and was disappointed. i watched the crucible, and enjoyed it. so the adaptions of books turning into movies was kind of like a flip of a coin, 50~50. we watched the movie after reading the book, and i was so intrigued about the movie, since i really felt the pain and anguish that willy loman has to go through just to establish a name in the business. i never really understood how people could come up with theorys about arthur miller's book from just reading it. then, after i really watched the movie, i could finally understand what arthur was trying to get across about the message of society. people are always looking for the ""new"" thing, like supermodels and business people. the more beauty, the more they want you. but after someone else comes along and shows something more than you can offer, you are thrown away like an ""orange peel"". dustin hoffman really does an outstanding job as the decripit old willy loman, and biff really adds to the movie as well. happy and the mom are just observers, trying to involve themselves into the weaving of biff and willy, because they are both high achievers looking for dreams that are just too hard for them to reach. willy wants a name, and biff wants to be properous and maybe both strive to be like willy's brother, ben. ben was only there for about 10 minutes, but really makes a mark in the movie. so, overall, the movie really is a great addition for arthur miller to put under the belt, since his movies (crucible) and this one really are great accomplishments by the director. at least they had the intergrity to keep the book the same, and still make that a work of art.

1199,Goodfellas,The Criminal Mindset,"The gangster film has been redefined so many times in cinema history it will be interesting to see how it is redefined once again. Goodfellas is a milestone film in that regard because just as Public Enemy and Little Caesar defined it in the Thirties, The Godfather trilogy in the seventies and eighties, Goodfellas set the standard that all other films including Martin Scorsese similar Casino try to meet. The interesting thing is that Martin Scorsese is young enough to redefine it again with another work. With Ray Liotta narrating his own life in crime in a flashback as real life criminal Henry Hill, Martin Scorsese offers us one fascinating glimpse of the criminal life in the Eisenhower to Reagan era. Henry Hill even as a child got sucked into the criminal life as a kid, as he said all he ever wanted to be was a gangster. Tutored by both Robert DeNiro and Paul Sorvino, Liotta takes part in one of the biggest heists of all time of Lufthansa Airlines at JFK Airport during the seventies. Goodfellas is the story of the events from Henry Hill's perspective leading up to the heist and the aftermath. For myself I've never seen the gangster mentality better expressed on screen except maybe by Sean Connery in Family Business. Liotta and Connery operate from the same mindset. If you work hard and hope it pays off in success, you're a dope. If you want something, just take it. When you come right down to it, that's how criminals think, it's the rest of us who are fools. Goodfellas was nominated for several Oscars, but came away with only one winner, Joe Pesci in the role of crazy Tommy DeVito. He's another criminal type, one who's driven by a terrible inferiority complex due to his short stature and does terrible things even to his own peers. And those peers don't forget as you see what happens to Pesci in Goodfellas. This turned out to be a career role for Pesci. He's a multi-talented man who's got an incredible range and can play everything from the Home Alone comedies to stone killers like here in Goodfellas or in Casino. There's usually a contest in which Scorsese fans argue whether Casino or Goodfellas is better. I happen to like Casino, but without the success of Goodfellas, Casino would not have been made. For a fascinating look at the criminal mindset, Goodfellas is an absolute must.",9.0,bkoganbing,2007/02/15,5,3

This movie was one of the best movies in 1999, as review aggregator, Rotten Tomatoes, reports that 90% out of 72 critics gave the film a positive review, with a rating average of 7.6/10: ""Rich in sweet sincerity, intelligence, and good old-fashioned inspirational drama, October Sky is a coming-of-age story with a heart to match its Hollywood craftsmanship. Also this movie won Critics' Choice Movie Awards for Best Family Film from the Broadcast Film Critics Association in 2000. It beautifully illustrates the biography of a teen Homer who is ambitious towards rocket science and ends up to be a scientist at NASA despite of all the mishappenings he faces in life. The story is a gem for the teens who are often led down by their dreams and dear ones. Full of emotions and zeal, the movie buys one a lot of encouragement to follow ones dreams. It proved very helpful to me and as it would be to all the people who have been facing a very hard time in life and not been able to do what they want to. The plot and the acting of the cast starring Chris Cooper, Jake Gyllenhaal, Laura Dern and Chris Owen is great and hence this movie easily and beautifully connects to people who got mind-stuck in teenage. As one would expect from Universal studios, the production house of the movie, the scenes combined with the acting is so real that it will take oneself back to the teen life of 1950's in America, which in itself is a wonderful experience.

1206,Ferris Bueller's Day Off,Not exactly a movie to be shown at teacher rallies,"I think you have to be or have been a teacher to feel as though John Hughes' movie ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" is like a student scraping his nails across your blackboard for 90 minutes. When this movie was first released, I happened to see it on a week where a student came tardy to my class, cussed me out when I called him on it, and then had his mother phone and tell me that I was overreacting [for doing what was expected of me] and tell me that she was praying for me. By the time I finished watching the movie, Principal Rooney (ployed by Jeffrey Jones), who was intended as a figure of fun, was a very sympathetic character to me. Anyway, Matthew Broderick plays the title role, an insufferable youngster who appears to have an angel of God at his side. Ferris concocts elaborate schemes for playing hooky from school, yet he manages to endear himself to everyone except Mr. Rooney, who can never quite catch Ferris in the act, and his sister Jennie (Jennifer Grey of ""Dirty Dancing""), who is justifiably annoyed at Ferris's liberties. One fine spring day, Ferris again fools his parents into thinking he is on Death's doorstep. When they leave for work, Ferris browbeats his downtrodden buddy Cameron (Alan Ruck, later of TV's ""Spin City"") into stealing his father's prized 1961 Ferrari, hijacking Ferris's girlfriend (Mia Sara) from school and going on a joyride. The angel-of-God analogy is particularly apt because the movie seems a latter-day version of deus-ex-machina. And never has a movie seemed so stagy. When Ferris starts talking to the camera (presaging similarly self-conscious '90s movies and TV shows), expounding his theories on life and skipping school, one half-expects to read ""Based on a play by Neil Simon"" in the credits. What a great combination--the self-righteousness of John Hughes and the Broadway smarminess of Matthew Broderick. Two minds without a single thought. And the film in constantly at odds with what it tries to tell us. At one point, Ferris tells us that you'll never get anywhere by kissing people's hindquarters. Yet he can't get anywhere without sucking up to people or manipulating them for his selfish whims. He also complains about his parents being weird. The poor kid--all his parents have ever given him are everything he wants, and more attention than his sister can hope to receive. And how is all of this massive manipulation possible? Because Hughes sets up cardboard characters and emotions. Mr. Rooney is essentially Wile E. Coyote, forever chasing the Road Runner in vain. Ferris's parents are vapid dummies who don't care much about anything. And Ferris is supposedly made lovable by such acts as his hammy performance to get out of school (an old bit when it was used in ""E.T."") and his lip-syncing to a rock song (which, after Tom Cruise in ""Risky Business"" and Rodney Dangerfield in ""Easy Money,"" was well on its way to become a modern-day movie cliché). All of the performances are execrable, except for Ruck as Cameron, the put-upon friend. When Cameron vows to take a stand against his dad, the scene almost works, despite its utter gravity, because Cameron has been such a likable dolt up until then. If only we could see a movie about a teenager like *him*, instead of this self-indulgent vehicle about a self-indulgent brat. When John Hughes--a Mel Brooks for high-school geeks--was asked how he prepares his scripts, he said, ""I never start with the jokes. I look at an issue and try to find the story in it...To me, 'Animal House' was a character movie."" That's funnier than anything in ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off.""",2.0,skad13,2004/06/27,104,49

1208,Detachment,Detachement,"We watched this movie thinking it would be a sort of dramatic view or portrait of general schools in US today. To our great surprise, we were submerged breathless, deep inside a personal tragedy and national state of education in US of A. We were expecting to see some prejudice. As it is accepted as a normal tendency in US to presume every single male in presence of younger children or relation between teacher and student, the adult being a potential child molester or someone with sexual intentions! Unfortunately as we were expecting, we were served in some point against the main character. We got an overview of the political and sociological corruption of the education system in this country through an example of a public school with stupid parents and children spoon-fed to all sort of advertising propaganda. Today shareholders, total number of sales and percentage of profits are scattering a dark veil on the education system of a country and its future generation. A country being the most powerful country in the world having the power to influence the future of the others. Now, if they start to grow up under a corrupt propaganda and dumb-down mainstream media and political system, what hope can the future generation hold on to? 10 minutes of glory on a cable TV show, singing? Ironically it seems after 70 years we have learned nothing from the history and recent WW II with hundreds of thousands of hours of documentaries and movies. It is a dark feel-good movie which at the end you won't feel neither satisfied nor hopeful in the future of this failed system and country.

1209,Spider-Man 2,"Is this movie strong? Listen, bud...","Review of SPIDER-MAN 2 by STEVEN BAILEY There are some ""popcorn movies"" that transcend their origins and just become great movies--""North by Northwest,"" ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" Add ""Spider-Man 2"" to the list. There's no good reason that a film about a guy with the dubious talent for traveling by web should be one of the most touching movies around. But darned if I wasn't near tears by movie's end. For that, kudos to director Sam Raimi, who found the same ""realistic"" tone in the first ""Spider-Man"" and extends it here. The characters seem like clichés--the clumsy kid turned super-hero, the erstwhile girlfriend, the doting aunt. But thanks to heartfelt encore performances from Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, and Rosemary Harris, they're more believable than those in more ""earthbound"" movies I've seen this year. Of course, some viewers don't go to ""Spider-Man"" movies for character depth, and action fans won't be disappointed here either. Alfred Molina, whom I've always found hammy, here has perfect pitch as Dr. Octavius--at first friendly and caring to Peter Parker (Spidey's daily alter-ego), then downright operatic in his revenge when his planned scientific breakthrough goes wrong and turns him into a kind of octopus-robot. But the movie spends an unusual amount of time letting us get to know its characters, so that viewers truly have a stake in the high-powered action scenes. (Warning: Those scenes might be very tough sledding for younger viewers. But if you've seen ""Spider-Man 1,"" you know what you're in for anyway.) Out of a flawless cast, I end by singling out thoroughly winning Kirsten Dunst as M.J., Peter/Spidey's love interest. Her dreamy, sunny face grounds the story in happy normalcy. And her final scene tops even ""S1's"" much-ballyhooed kiss. This movie has it all. Go.",10.0,skad13,2004/06/24,6,5

It has been many years since I have seen a sci film that presented so many excellent science fiction ideas to its audience. Any one of the concepts in this film can spawn conversation that last for hours and cumulatively you can talk about Moon for days.

1213,Interstellar,Cosmic,"Somehow, I'd missed ""Interstellar"" up to this point, so with the cinemas in the UK tentatively reopening after Covid shutdown, we decided that the IMAX presentation of the film would be a good way to ease ourselves back in to going. Whereas I had some issues with the film, as an IMAX presentation it was certainly an experience. Set in the near future, where a blight is systematically destroying all the crops of the Earth. The remnants of NASA launch a spaceship on a multiyear mission to investigate whether any planets on the other side of a newly appeared wormhole are suitable for human life. This ships designated pilot, Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) must decide whether to sacrifice time with his children in the hope of saving the human race. You can't argue that ""Interstellar"" isn't good. It is top notch in every aspect of filmmaking. The visual effects, the score, the performances are all spellbinding. This is one of history's greatest directors bring us his version of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" - with all the layers, expressionism and concepts that the inspiration has. It also operates as Nolan's love letter to his daughter, about the time he sacrifices away from her to make his movies and how he feels about that. It is a masterpiece. All that said, I didn't love it. Not the way I have done other films, not in the way I have done other Nolan films - and I'm hard pressed to explain exactly why that is. I feel . . detached from it, somehow, maybe there's slightly too much going on? Maybe it's a little contrived at the end? Maybe it's a little too similar to ""Contact"" as well as ""2001""?

1215,Spider-Man 2,A teenager character study.,"Spiderman 2 has become a fond memory of my movie experiences, mainly due to the fact that this was the first film that provided me with an emotional investment in the characters and also illuminated me to the power that films can present. Previous to this surreal experience i liked films as a form of entertainment, however the second viewing of this film, i believe, developed my love for cinema. Spiderman 2 is a superhero movie in the minimal sense, the film provides the dangers that a superhero faces but rather is concerned in developing a character study on the concepts of being a teenager and facing simple life problems. This is where the brilliance lies in spiderman 2, it's focus is on peter parker rather than spiderman. The audience sees immediately, as we are introduced to peter parker, the challenges he's faces from the creation of parker/spiderman. As to the previous film, we are introduced to peter parker narrating his daily life problems such as trouble at work, failing at school, struggling with rent and his social inability for Mary Jane. Raimi takes the first 10 minutes to establish these problems, which is great because it provides a brilliant focus for the movie and creates amazing pathos for the audience to establish an emotional investment. These opening sequences also create raimi exploration into the superhero paradox, spiderman offers the opportunity to save people from danger and the chance to be classified as a hero, however why does peter risk his life and sacrifice his social life when he is unappreciated for his efforts. Peter realized that the personification of spiderman was a self sacrifical curse, however peter is beginning to question his obligations. Furthermore there is a new villain in town 'doc ock' who is a scientist that has 4 mechanical arms welded to his body, sounds ridiculous doesn't it?, however raimi provides Octavius with a great sense of depth, a scientist tragical embedded into his own creation. Furthermore the birth of 'doc ock' brilliantly shows off raimi love for horror, as the scene encapsulates the villain while paying homage to horror classics. Once again Maguire is great, his ability to convey a sense of innocence effortlessly compliments the pathos that are used. Consider the scene when peter confesses the truth about uncle Ben death to aunt may or when he tells uncle ben that he has to give up their promise, it's quite impossible for the audience to not share some kind of emotional investment into peter's character. The previous spiderman was noted for the first use of CGI, which brought high and lows, however it seems raimi has improved dramatically at incorporating the use of this technology as the action sequences flow quite effortlessly. Particuly the train sequence, as the CGI allows the action to obtain an exhilarating level. As i previously noted, where spiderman 2 brilliance lies, is in it's ability to create a superhero movie that draws it's attention to not the superhero but rather the individual, who makes the choice to protect humanity and the predicaments that are cursed with this choice. Spiderman 2 is a teenager character study, most notable a drama then an action film, IMO the first superhero film to break the concepts of what these 'genre' films can represent.",9.0,jackosurfing14,2012/08/04,12,10
1216,Interstellar,Grand ideas don't make great movies,"It is beyond me how people can claim the movie to be 'brainy', 'intelligent', 'well written'... With all the things I read about the movie prior to seeing it makes it the biggest disappointment I've experienced from cinema in years. I give 1 star to bring balance to the current rating, in reality this movie is of course not that bad. The whole idea behind the plot is that McConaughey ended up in this blackhole where 5 dimensions were compressed into 3 dimensions and stuff, and where he was able to manipulate gravity by sending his daughter the message which was imperative for saving humanity. So what in fact happened is through this ridiculously improbable chain of events McConaughey ended up inside this blackhole. All this was apparently the result of a bigger plan all along. Was there really no easier way for (future humans/aliens) to transmit this data, and if they built this time-space warping machine inside the blackhole - means they had access to the data all along? And also means they chose McConaughey daughter on purpose? So I don't understand, what was this purpose? Could they not have connected their portal to professor's office a long time ago, or go for one of the ten billion more rational alternatives? On a side note: is it not funny how McConaughey ignored the message NOT TO GO from the same 'ghost' yet followed the rest of the directions? While in the end of the movie he idiotically repeats his feeble attempt. Had he added 'it's you dad' or any other sensible hint he would have saved his daughter years of suffering (and maybe a lifetime for himself when he realises this). And I don't even want to get into how ridiculous it is that he transmitted data by moving the hands on the watch, which was unaffected after being picked up, meaning it was hardly gravitational manipulation was it? What was the point of trying to be scientific and trying to explain it in this way then. If he could do that, he ought to have found a better solution that did not require his daughter 25 years to figure out. And anyway, they saved humanity by building this massive station named after his daughter (by that time they knew what he went through and they still named it after her?). Why couldn't they have done the same thing on Earth? Just build the same goddamn station on Earth without needing to harvest their gravitational energy bullsh*t, bam, humanity saved in the same way.

1217,Crash,Review: Ensemble cast delivers top-notch performances in reflective drama,"In a drama strikingly reminiscent in style and tone of P.T. Anderson's film Magnolia (1999), the narrative in Crash shifts between 5 or 6 different groups of seemingly unconnected characters, whose relationships to each other are only revealed in the end. Not to be confused with the David Cronenberg feature of the same name, this Crash is the feature-length, studio-released directorial debut of veteran Canadian TV writer/producer/director and two-time Emmy-winner Paul Haggis. An in-depth exploration on the themes of racism and prejudice, cause and effect, chance and coincidence, and tragedy, ""crash"" is a metaphor for the collisions between strangers in the course of day-to-day existence. Set over a 24-hour period in contemporary L.A., it is a social commentary on the interconnectedness of life in the big city. Crash features a top-notch ensemble cast which includes: Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle, Matt Dillon, Jennifer Esposito, Brendan Fraser, Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges, Loretta Devine, Thandie Newton, Ryan Phillipe and Larenz Tate. All put in superb performances in a tight script which is at once gritty, heartwarming, shocking, tragic and witty, and which will ring true with viewers of all demographics. Centering around two disturbing car accidents, a carjacking, vicious workplace vandalism, and the suspicious shooting death of one police officer by another, the drama is set against the backdrop of a racist LAPD and Los Angeles justice system. Action shifts between the various characters, whose lives collide with each other in unpredictable ways as each faces their own moral dilemma, and tries to cope with the consequences of their resulting decision made or action taken. Each of the dozen or so main characters undergoes some type of a personal metamorphosis as the various story lines head toward a striking, common conclusion, which succeeds at being both cathartic and unsettling. Crash is backed by a solid and varied, original soundtrack and excellent cinematography. Sweeping, wider shots alternate with disjointed camera angles which convey the chaos and confusion of the characters and the unpredictability of life. Occasional lingering close-ups -- on occasion without sound -- capture the actors' facial expressions, which suitably detail key moments of the characters' aching pain, fear, anger, bitter anguish, remorse or grief, far better than any dialogue could. This breathtaking film is destined to be a critical smash and box-office hit. Five stars.",10.0,Brambo,2004/09/11,1273,869

On March 5, 2006, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences did something so inexplicable that my head is still spinning. The Academy voted one of the worst films ever made, ""Best Picture."" You heard me right, ""Crash"" is one of the worst films ever made. No, ""Crash"" isn't bad in the way of ""Plan Nine from Outer Space."" ""Crash"" is bad because it thinks it is so good and that its message is so important that it bears repeating over and over and over again until everyone gets it. But what is the message of ""Crash?"" There seems to be some confusion about this aspect of the film which I will clear up for you. In its simplest form, the message of ""Crash"" is, people can be categorized into racial stereotypes and it is understandable that we are prejudiced towards them. For example, the film shows us that all young black men are carjackers and criminals and it is perfectly justified for white women to fear them. All Asians, but especially Asian women, are bad drivers and talk funny. Another example is that all white cops are prejudiced against blacks. Even white cops that appear to be good on the outside are all racists. When the least bit frustrated white cops will molest black women instead of kicking the dog, and white cops will shoot young black men in the blink of an eye for simply reaching in their pocket. Rich, white women all hate Hispanics and treat their Hispanic maids like dirt. Black women are all drug addicts on welfare or have funny names. Okay, maybe that's only one of the messages of the film. I guess another message of ""Crash"" is that everyone is prejudiced towards some race and that includes the writer, director, and producer. Well, to be fair, the writers (Haggis and Moresco, director (Haggis), and the many producers are just prejudiced toward blacks, Asians, and Persians; they have no problem with Hispanics. Hispanics are the only good people in the film and have no prejudices. Oh, I forgot! Hispanics are prejudiced against bad driving, funny talking Asian women. Another ""Crash"" message is that, if you're having a bad day, if you're father is having health problems, of course you're going to be a racist. After all, isn't everyone? I know you're confused now because you and so many others were tricked by the film into believing that it was against racism. Don't feel bad because the writers and director of ""Crash"" use every trick in the book to manipulate you into thinking that, because they had some noble cause for making the film it is appropriate to use racial stereotypes. After all, the Academy had no problem with it so why should you. Okay, so the message of ""Crash"" is that racial stereotypes exist and everyone is prejudiced is kind of disgusting, but does that in itself make it one of the worst films? No, there are countless other flaws with the screenplay that make this film one of the worst. The only positive thing I can say about the script is that it is going to be a great teaching tool to show students what not to do when writing a screenplay. For example, in the very first scene of the film, Don Cheadle and his partner, Jennifer Esposito, get into a minor car accident. Cheadle then says the following, ""It's the sense of touch. In any real city, you walk, you know? You brush past people, people bump into you. In L.A., nobody touches you. We're always behind this metal and glass. I think we miss that touch so much, that we crash into each other, just so we can feel something."" Can anyone explain to me why the Academy awarded this ""Best Original Screenplay?"" It's like it was written by some pretentious high school student trying to show off to the teacher. Besides the clunky, pretentious dialog, the screenwriters overuse irony to a degree I can't remember seeing in any other film. It's like they are going to hit us over the head with irony until we just know what great writers they are. After this film, Congress should pass a law limiting impossible ironic coincidences and ironic twists to no more than two per film. Hefty fines should be levied for each one over the limit. By my count, there are a minimum of 15 ironic coincidences or twists in ""Crash."" How many can you come up with? Maybe this could be a fun party game like Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon. I want to give one more specific example of the many problems with screenplay, but I'm hard pressed to talk about just one. Maybe it should be the carjackers, or maybe the invisible cloak or the second car crash. I just can't decide. Well, I'll just end with snow. On at least a few occasions, different characters in the film mention that the weather calls for possibility of snow in Los Angeles (the last time it snowed in LA was 1962). At the end of the film, white flakes fall from the sky, but they are the ashes from a burning car which was the site of a racially motivated murder. I'm not sure what the screenwriters had in mind with this scene, but I'm sure it was another heavy-handed allusion to something very deep. Maybe it was the ashes of racial hatred raining down on the city? And again, the Academy voted this Best Picture.",1.0,mdmc-1,2006/03/12,147,85

This movie teach us that even in the most difficult situations we must believe that something or someone will come.

This movie is up there with The Dark Knight as one of the best superhero movies. This movie was loved when it came out, now it's cool to hate on the trilogy. Spider-Man 2 improved on all aspects of Spider-Man 1. Peter is struggling to be Spider-Man, and the movie illustrates that very well. The action is better than lots of movies today, most notably the train fight scene. Danny Elfman provides an unforgettable soundtrack. This movie and the trilogy shouldn't be overlooked as some cheesy 2000s movies, because they paved the way for the MCU as we know it today.",10.0,ditkovich_rent,2019/01/04,334,292

Highlights all the narcissism and self entitlement problems females today bring to the world. Princess syndrome at it's worst. Two sick people and a family, and one individual spends the entire time only thinking of herself and what she wants, how these other person can improve her pitiful life while she does nothing to contribute back. Thinking they need her and won't be able to cope or survive without her, come on.

1228,The Chorus,"Bittersweet Tale of Hope, Teaching, and Bucking the System","Too many people are afraid to see foreign language films - and it's a pity more people didn't get a chance to see this in the theatre. It's a great movie for anyone who has ever been changed by a teacher's efforts, or frustrated by an unjust system. Set in post-World War II France it's about a teacher who finds himself posted at a school for troubled boys. Although the corporal punishment is harsh, the boys don't seem to have any respect for the severe headmaster...nor anyone else. It is in this environment that the gentle Clement Mathieu arrives and struggles to find a way to break through to the boys and bring humanity back to the wild gaggle of youth. The film is well made and feels old fashioned and more leisurely paced from a far less ""sped-up"" time. Not a ""feel good"" movie and not a downer, more bittersweet, but well-worth the effort if you run across it.",10.0,MRavenwood,2006/09/26,1,1

You spend the entire film waiting for it to end so it can make some sort of sense,then it reaches the end,and guess what still nothing.But don't worry about the bad ending, the movie never really gets your hopes that high so that the bad ending is that much of a disappointment,it is more of a relief that it is over.""Moon"" is just a terrible terrible movie in my opinion, I have no idea how this movie received an 8.0 on the IMDb rating scale.",1.0,clmlo,2011/08/07,88,41
1230,Horrible Bosses 2,Just Horrible,"In the first Horrible Bosses our intrepid trio tended to add two part incompetence with every bad idea they had and the film mixed laughs with just the right dose of dark humour. In Horrible Bosses 2, this time the mark is Christoph Waltz as the Boss who cheats Day, Bateman and Sudeikis over their Shower Buddy product and decide to kidnap his smarmy son, Chris Pine who is also in on the kidnap so they can all split the ransom. Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Aniston and Jamie Foxx who appeared in the first film, pop up again. Things that does not return is a plot, script and jokes. The trio just drone on and on until you are on the edge of entering a deep coma, then Day's irritating character pulls you out of it before the babbling begins again. Its all filler because the film has no proper script. Waltz in fact only makes a cameo in this movie and is left to Pine to salvage what he can with this film. The first film had some inventiveness in its dark comedy, even had some cod Hitchcockian overtures. This was just a shambles and the fact that it contains a few laughs saves it from a total bomb rating.",2.0,Prismark10,2015/03/01,14,6

Christina Hendricks is again (as in Drive) wasted, as is Lucy Liu. Bryan Cranston, on the other hand, is superb. The ooey gooey ending doesn't disappoint, but animal lovers may want to skip this since a friendly orange tabby is sacrificed in order to move the action back into James Caan's office.",8.0,ctonjes-302-616242,2012/02/25,12,8
1232,October Sky,An American Billy Elliott,"Audiences could be forgiven for confusing ""Billy Elliott"" to be a remake of ""October Sky."" Both films take place in coal mining towns, both concern young boys who yearn for something more than going down in the mines, both boys have tough fathers who are disapproving of their career choices, both boys have tough older brothers, both boys have supportive female teachers, both films involve strikes, and both films are exceptionally well done and emotionally uplifting. With the success of Elton John's musical version of ""Billy Elliott,"" how long can it be before ""October Sky"" hits Broadway. Like Billy's tale, the story of Homer Hickam is based in fact. Captivated by the launching of the Russian satellite, Sputnik, Homer wants to launch his own rocket, and Werner von Braun becomes his hero. Teaming with three schoolmates and encouraged by his teacher, Homer learns all he can about rocketry to achieve his goal. Well written with conviction and heart, ""October Sky"" has a fine cast that seems to have realized the special nature of the project. A young Jake Gyllenhaal is fine as Homer, a role that obviously gave a boost to his career. Laura Dern is excellent as Miss Riley, the cheer-leading teacher. However, Chris Cooper is the standout as John Hickam, a man who has spent his life in the mines, risen to a leadership role, and does not comprehend that his son wants more than that. Cooper is a master of repressed feeling. For some unknown reason, Cooper was overlooked at awards time for this and his later roles in ""American Beauty"" and ""Breach,"" which makes his Oscar for ""Adaptation"" all the more deserving. Although filmed in Tennessee, Fred Murphy's cinematography captures the gray bleakness of a West Virginia mining town. The use of popular songs from the 1950's and early 1960's adds a nice period feeling, and Mark Isham's haunting original score aches with nostalgia. However, Gyllenhaal and Cooper are at the core of the film, and their scenes together capture a strained father-son relationship that evolves over the course of the film into one of mutual respect. Again, this parallels the dynamics of Billy and his father. Elton John, are you listening?",8.0,dglink,2009/06/19,1,1
1233,Goodfellas,A masterpiece (spoilers),"The opening to Goodfellas  the murder of Billy Batts  shows the beginning of the end of Henry Hill. Up until that point, despite the thieving and the violence, everything is rather light-hearted. There's a sense of solidarity amongst the criminals. But once Batts is murdered, infighting, greed and addiction take over. The life will get you in the end. But the opening scenes are great at establishing the allure of being a gangster. After all, as the movies have always shown, it's a very seductive world. I mean, who wouldn't want to be able to thumb their nose in the face of the law if they could get away with it? Therefore it's totally right that the film shows you all the fun aspects of this criminal life. And at the beginning the camera focuses on all the accoutrements of gangsterism  jewellery, shoes, cars etc. They're almost like movie stars. And at the beginning the violence is even intended to seduce you. There's a great bit where Henry's postman is threatened with an oven to make sure he doesn't give any school letters to Henry's parents. The way it's shot and scored makes it seem like something of a lark. You're asked to acknowledge and respect the power and audacity of these guys. And the icing on the cake is the final-freeze frame of the terrified postman's face  these guys control life and death; if you don't respect them you're going in the oven. But freeze-frames occur frequently in the early part of the film. There's a powerful shot where Henry's dad is beating him with a belt and it's stopped right in the middle of the whipping. It makes the beating seem even more violent than it already is and it makes you understand and identify with Henry's rebellion; soon no one will be able to do that to him again. However, the most famous freeze-frame in the film is when Henry sets the cars on fire. The image is held as Henry makes a Christ-like pose with flames behind him  he's finally in the life; welcome to hell. And another early scene I like is when the young Henry gets pinched. He thinks the guys will be mad at him for getting caught, but because he keeps his mouth shut he's welcomed from the court like a conquering hero. And the scene even ends with another freeze-frame. It might as well be a family portrait. But the good times extend into Henry's adult life. He steals trucks, makes lots of money and even falls in love. And this leads to another great scene  the long Steadicam shot when Henry takes Karen to the Copacabana. This is her seduction. This is when she is seduced by the life. And another seduction is the scene where Henry pummels one of Karen's neighbours. He's supposed to have touched Karen so Henry rearranges his face with the butt of his gun. But although it's incredibly violent and although the sound effects make you wince, you can see why Karen would be turned on. How many other men would do this for her? How many other men would protect her in such a brutal way? Not many. However, like I said at the beginning, Billy Batts is when everything begins to go downhill. From that point on the murders become more frequent and collective greed is overtaken by personal greed. But I do have to say that the Batts murder is my favourite scene. The dialogue and the timing between Joe Pesci and Frank Vincent is outstanding and the beating has so much emotion. You kind of get whipped up in it yourself. You can feel what it must be like to get your on back on someone you hate. And the choice of music ('Atlantis' by Donovan) is perfect. It raises the scene to another level. But Scorsese's choice of music is always spot-on. The other musical highlight has to be his use of the closing music in 'Layla'. It's a beautiful piece, which makes it work well with the grisly murders it shows  the images kind of show an end of an era, which, what with the music, lends the whole sequence a strange kind of romanticism. And it also works well because the emotion of the song and the final piece of music go hand in hand with what Jimmy (De Niro) is feeling at the time  the song and the music is about yearning for someone and then having that love fulfilled, and Jimmy is beside himself with pleasure that Tommy (Pesci) is being made. He thinks his dreams are finally coming true. Unfortunately, though, that sequence is when the real nightmare kicks in. After this, Henry becomes an addict and screws up so bad that he has to betray his friends. And the sequence that shows the day of his arrest is rather amazing. Again Scorsese proves himself to be a master of using music to emphasise emotion and mood, and it's shot in such a way with zooms and fast edits that you feel as strung out as Henry. It's coke film-making but in a good way. And I also like the final scene between Jimmy and Karen. With smiles and promises he tries to whack her, but she gets scared and manages to get away. It's a good way of showing what's wrong with this life without moralising  in this life you can never truly trust your friends; and who really wants to live like that? But at the end, despite everything, you also get to see that Henry misses his life. And although it's supremely arrogant of him to say that he gets to live the rest of his life like a schnook, you sort of know what he means. If only he and his pals weren't so damn greedy they would have had it made.",,Ricky_Roma__,2006/05/06,5,3
1234,Ferris Bueller's Day Off,Spoilt brats laugh at the working man,"Let me first say that the main story here, involving the kids, contains many iconic scenes. The problem is the sub-plot about the misadventures of the school's principle (Mr Rooney) which seems to come from a different and inferior film. Its lazy slapstick brings to mind the worst parts of Police Academy or Home Alone. But the problem is deeper than that. It is philosophical. For here we have 3 affluent kids who have pampered lifestyles (particularly the insufferable Ferris), and our sympathies are supposed to lie with them. Meanwhile the butt of the joke is someone who actually has to work for a living. The cruelty with which he is subjected to humiliation while the kids swan around at others' expense is actually quite sickening. It is like seeing aristocrats gorging themselves and then being invited to laugh at their servants. It is no good saying that he is an authority figure. That would only work if the kids were of a lower standing in society as he is. If they were Chaplinesque hobos who needed to kick a cop up the behind or they were acting out of necessity, you could understand it. But they are entirely selfish. Ferris Bueller is an impossibly perfect youth, good looking, pampered by his parents, with a beautiful girlfriend and an assortment of gadgets which would have cost his adversary, principle Rooney, a year's wages back in the mid 80s. We are constantly told how popular he is in school. Why? I imagine a real life Bueller would annoy the hell out of most people. His friend Cameron has access to at least two cars, one of which is a fabulous Ferrari which his father keeps in a large garage overlooking a specular wooded area. And we are supposed to care that these, and Bueller's girl, go on a joyride? Rather like in the old Road Runner cartoons, which suppose our sympathies should lie with a one-dimensional annoying character rather than the harassed workaholic, I guess many people were hoping that Bueller would get his comeuppance in the end.

1235,Hotel Transylvania,Grand Hotel,"Set in a world in which monsters fear the wrath of human beings, Count Dracula runs a refuge and has to hide the fact that his latest guest is really a lost human backpacker this animated comedy. While never short on imagination, the film begins poorly with lame flatulence and urination gags as well as silly wordplay with terms like ""holy rabies"" and ""scream cheese"". The humour does not really improve as the movie progresses either (fingers stuck up noses), but the main characters become well developed and likable, especially the backpacker - an avid horror fan who enjoys interacting with the monsters with a natural curiosity, sticking his hands into skeletons and so forth. Some of the backdrop gags work well too (the backpacker beaten up by an invisible knight) and there is a great sequence towards the end where the monsters come across a town in which they are celebrated as horror legends rather than feared. The film does, however, also become more sentimental as it progresses, especially as Dracula's daughter predictability falls in love, but the overall product is more enjoyable than one might expect from the barrage of toilet humour and groan-inducing wordplay puns early on.",,sol-,2017/10/27,1,1
1236,Hotel Transylvania,Not That Funny...,"This movies is funny, but not that funny. Obviously that is an extremely opinionated assertion, but it's my opinion. There just wasn't enough humor to cover up the obvious annoying clichés and the painful lack of likable characters. This movie does absolutely nothing to draw you in and make you care at all about what happens to these creatures. The premise is great - a hotel where all the terrors of the past and present congregate? How could such an interesting idea be messed up? Like this. For one thing, there were no surprises. Without giving too much away, I can say that it was obvious from the beginning what was going to happen to each one-dimensional character, and even more irritating was that it all happened using the same formula as every other stupid teen angst movie ever made. None of the characters interested me. None were developed enough. Were there funny moments? Yes, and of course they managed to fit in the tiny, harmless yet funny reference to the certain famous/infamous series regarding sparkly fanged creatures, and that was all good and satisfying. Still, there were few rib-crackers... nothing that made you fall out of your seat giggling. Okay, I'm only just getting to my real problem with this film - it's obvious political and social messages. Bottom line, let your kids go, they should be given room to breathe, etc. Whether you agree with that message or not, we see it so sickeningly often in film these days, it's become a kind of disgusting platitude. Originality? Anyone? And also, they do next to nothing to veil the obvious metaphor of monsters living in hiding (literally in closets, for some of them) misunderstood by the rest of the world. I make so social or political statements here when I say that it was way, way too obvious. And it makes the movie, for me, far more dramatic than it needs to be. Obviously, no one is going to take such a silly animated movie seriously, so why try to stuff dramatic messages in there? And why is it that a kid's movie is all of a sudden the place to be stuffing these political messages? In short, there was nothing about this movie that made me think, ""Heh, that's interesting. I like that."" I'd seen it all before. If it had cracked me up, perhaps I could have given it a pass. But it just wasn't that funny.",3.0,brown-faith922,2013/07/29,11,6
1237,Hotel Transylvania,Great voice acting and visual effects save this otherwise average animated adventure,"Although I am only 21 I feel I am too old when watching these new children's animated films. What looked like a fun, entertaining movie ended up being disjointed, manic and sentimental. It's like all the kids these days have ADD and can't concentrate on a well-told story so the filmmakers feel the need to have almost no pause in the action and just go from scene to scene with no breather, inserting pop-culture references everywhere. Even my eight year old cousin who I took to see this said the movie felt ""like it went faster than other movies."" The voice cast is excellent, with Adam Sandler, Steve Buscemi, David Spade, Andy Samberg and Kevin James lending their talents. Visually the film is quite stunning, with vibrant colours and hideous monsters sure to scare the kiddies. In terms of the 3D I wasn't really impressed but I haven't been impressed with any 3D movie as I find it adds next to nothing to the experience but hey, the children seem to love it and it brings in more money so I'm sure it's here to stay. So why does this animated kids' film fail to come together? Bursts of manic pacing steamroll over most of the wit in the story, and by the end the whole movie is bogged down by parental mush about trusting one's kid to make her own discoveries.

Second, it is aesthetically captivating and pleasant to follow. Cowperthwaite's reconstructs the narrative leading to the final, and fatal, encounter of Tilikum and Dawn Brancheau, alternating footage, both in the wild and in aquariums, with interviews and contextual data. Finally, it is a work that, without ever abandoning neutrality, serves a mostly noble cause: that against the confinement of animals that are intelligent, social, and set to crisscross oceans, not to be kept in tanks. My hope is that, by being such a fine piece of art, it also helps change the industry of marine-life entertainment theme parks. So ""Blackfish"" is a big splash in more than one way!

1242,Spider-Man 2,Enter Dr. Octopus!,"I have never been a big fan of the first Spider-Man movie, but I have to agree that its sequels, especially 'Spider-Man 3' have finally won me over. I've been a Spider-Man fan for a rather long time, but the Green Goblin has always been, to me at least, the lamest villains in Spider-Man's villains galore. Dr. Octopus isn't really the coolest one in the bunch either, but growing up I kinda liked him and his movie incarnation presented a nice multi-level character. The second Spider-Man has the convincing CGI effects but is also miles more interesting and comedy-packed than its predecessor, which is why I liked it so much. Though some parts of it are borderline cheesy there's enough to keep the film grounded. Only the middle-part of the film seemed horridly stretched out and a little boring though its nice to present Spider-Man having problems. I also wasn't irked by the revelation of his identity to a number of individuals, but in some places the film just seemed to lose its pace at times. However, the film undoubtedly has all the right ingredients of a great film. It doesn't compare to Spider-Man 3 in terms of plot, but it definitely has a memorable cast and is in most ways superior to the first one. Definitely recommendable.",8.0,TheHande,2007/05/19,3,3

I've been tricked so many times this year by high-ratings and rave reviews to films which have turned out to me absolutely atrocious that I'm losing my faith in film critics and the cinema-going public alike. I was promised this film would be a tearjerker, but the only thing that jerked was my gag reflex. I have never met a more obnoxious and irritating character as Augustus Waters and the whole script was painfully cheesy for about 80% of the film. I strongly recommend you do not see this movie.

1245,Detachment,The Relationship between Henry & Grandpa,"Why Henry cares about the issue of kids so much? Why Henry cares about the issue of raping so much? Why Henry cares about the issue of women so much? And why Henry's mother made him lock the door at night, and he says that was the way his mother protected him? What issue does Henry's grandpa want Henry's mother to forgive? If we connect all these questions together, the result is obvious. Henry's grandpa raped his mother. One key role in the movie never be mentioned, Henry's father, so I have the reason to believe that Henry's grandpa actually is Henry's father.",10.0,mile-times,2012/11/02,9,6
1246,Spider-Man 2,"Superior to the original, with some problems worked out!","Before going to see this sequel to 2002's ""Spider-Man"", I read a very positive review of it, and after doing so, I had high expectations! Surprisingly, I left the theatre disappointed that night, and failed to see how it was superior to the first (many clearly to believe it is). However, after watching ""Spider-Man"" again on the small screen more than 2 1/2 years later, all the praise the movie has received suddenly made sense to me! It has been two years since the events we saw in the first movie took place. Peter Parker is still Spider-Man, but unfortunately, he hasn't been having the best of luck lately. His life as Spider-Man is causing nothing but trouble in his life as Peter Parker. He can't seem to ever be punctual, which makes it very hard for him to keep a job and make it to his university classes. Also, due to misunderstandings, Mary Jane Watson and Harry Osborn no longer consider him their friend! His life as Spider-Man isn't going so well, either, as lately, his powers have often been malfunctioning, and the Daily Bugle is constantly trying to make him look bad to the city. So, Peter decides to give up his life as Spider-Man and move on. However, with a new villain threatening the town, Dr. Octopus (Dr. Otto Octavius, a scientist whose invention has gone wrong and taken control of him), it appears that Spider-Man is needed! I guess I was disappointed when I saw ""Spider-Man 2"" in the theatre because it was a bit darker and more dramatic than I expected. However, when I watched the movie again, I was obviously prepared for that, and managed to see a lot more in the film. It definitely has more funny moments than its predecessor (there certainly aren't any moments in the first ""Spider-Man"" movie that can match the part where Peter is on an elevator in his Spider-Man suit). Also, despite some dragging around the beginning, the excitement is probably more consistent, with more action in the movie, and the dialogue, while not always perfect, doesn't get quite as cheesy as it sometimes gets in the first movie. This second installment involves more romance between Peter and Mary Jane, but it never gets quite as embarrassing as it does at least once in the first. Sequels may not usually turn out to be as good or superior to their predecessors, but ""Spider-Man 2"" turned out to be one of those rare cases! Overall, this is certainly not an absolutely perfect superhero flick, but it comes closer to being one than the original ""Spider-Man"" movie adaptation. So, I wouldn't expect this movie to be quite the same as the 2002 blockbuster. I also wouldn't expect it to be quite the same as the comics, if you're at all familiar with those. However, if you want good action, a bit of humour, and some drama, you will likely find it all in this 2004 smash hit!",9.0,Electrified_Voltage,2007/07/30,6,5
1247,Horrible Bosses 2,"While Horrible Bosses 2 is not entirely horrible, it is still a carbon copy of the first film.","You know something is not quite right when the original director and screenwriters are not involved in the making of a sequel. While some sequels have actually benefited from new scriptwriters and a different director, Horrible Bosses 2, if anything, stands testament to an age old maxim – 'don't fix it if it ain't broke'. What made Horrible Bosses a laugh out riot was a funny yet believable story about three white collar stiffs locking horns with their evil bosses. More than just an outrageous comedy, it was a dark fantasy appealing to every Tom, Dick and Harriet cursed with an over demanding boss. At some point, that fantasy works with universal reference to almost anyone watching that film. What worked well in the first film also ended with that film because original director Seth Gordon ensured there weren't many loose ends. One of the main problems with this sequel is the fact that there isn't an actual boss. After the farce that left one boss dead (Colin Farrell) and another in prison (Kevin Spacey), Nick (Bateman), Kurt (Sudeikis) and Dale (Day) return as potential entrepreneurs of a bathroom gizmo they call 'Shower Buddy'. But even before they sell their product, the trio is fleeced by real billionaire entrepreneur Bert Hanson (Christoph Waltz). Now calling themselves Nickkurtdale Inc, (pronounced as one word, this is even used as a racial gag), they then retort to the dark side by contracting the services of their former no-good adviser – Dean ""MF"" Jones. Returning as Jones, Jamie Foxx has the best lines in the film and somehow stays above the rest with nothing but amusing screen presence. With a little poking and prodding from Jones, Nickkurtdale devices the perfect plan – kidnap Hanson's equally ruthless son Rex (Chris Pine) as revenge and ransom. Problem is, Rex hates his father too, thus setting up this sequel into a heist of sorts. Gone is the chemistry between the three leads. Instead, they are written off as imbeciles. A major chunk of Horrible Bosses 2 is made up of whining and bickering from Nick and Kurt, and high pitched squealing from Dale, who turns out to be the team's dimwit with a retarded solution for every situation they encounter. If this is director Sean Anders and a trio of new scriptwriters' way of saying that office workers barely think outside their cubicle, they may be on to something by reiterating that a boss is only as horrible as an employee allowing said boss to remain so. That tick aside, everything else is mere copy-paste from the original including an almost ditto ending. With the story remaining the same, albeit without any real boss, the only difference is watching actors play concentrated versions of their former characters. Fans of the first film can revel in two short scenes that bring back Spacey, now a criminal with even more wicked sarcasm, while those who fantasized having Jennifer Aniston as a man-eater boss is in for another steamy treat. On the other hand, new additions played by Pine and Waltz aren't penned with enough gusto, especially if like me, you go in expecting maniacal devotion from the latter. At best, Horrible Bosses 2 is a re-written version of the first film. At worst, it is unnecessarily re-written. But if you decide to watch this sequel, the best thing you can do is highly recommend it to your boss; just don't blame me if you get fired.",5.0,LloydBayer,2014/12/07,24,9

1250,Interstellar,A visual and auditory marvel,"Interstellar is a movie like no other. Unlike many apocalyptic sci-fi films that feature advanced technology as the source of our destruction (ala The Terminator movies), it instead asserts that technology will save us. Not everyone in Interstellar recognizes the potential of advanced technology. Most dismiss it as a waste of time and resources, and not just old curmudgeons feel this way. Thoughtful, intelligent young characters share this sentiment. This belief gained steam following a world-wide blight that wiped out the vast majority of life on earth—crops and humans. Farming became paramount while advanced technology was deemed frivolous. Cooper (McConaughey) remains one of the few survivors who still appreciates the need for engineering. He feels like a man lost in time, until he stumbles into the headquarters of NASA (which had been operating in secret due to public disapproval). Here he meets others who realize that a return to our old ways is unsustainable and will ultimately lead to our demise. We need technology to save us. As Michael Caine, playing the brilliant (duh!) Professor Brand, eloquently tells Cooper, ""we were never meant to save the world. We were meant to leave it."" For a movie that won an Oscar for Best Visual Effects (and deservedly so) the sound stole the show. Hans Zimmer (Dark Knight Trilogy) unleashed a performance that was, quite appropriately, out of this world. Never have I seen a movie elevated so much by its score. The sound literally took my breath away. Forgive me for the next paragraph. I will gush irresponsibly about the magic that is this movie's sound. Skip it if you please. You have your warning. The music fueled every important scene. In every meaningful moment Zimmer's harmonies captivated watchers' attention in the way of a coach commanding a locker room with a pregame speech. The music elucidated those emotional scenes, particularly ones featuring Cooper and his daughter, in a way that no words or visual ques possibly could. I sat frozen, jaw agape, with tears pouring down my cheeks as the music completely overwhelmed my emotions. The sound penetrated my soul and reverberated through my body, flowing to my appendages, supplying me with life like a heartbeat pumping blood through my veins. The music was truly the life force of movie. Yes, we all witnessed a visual triumph, a daring creative wonder the likes of which we haven't encountered since Inception. Yes, nearly every actor's performance proved worthy of commendation. McConaughey is on fire. Chastain is blossoming into a star. At this point Michael Cain exudes such knowledge and wisdom by merely appearing on screen that if he were cast as Albert Einstein, people would wonder if the role were beneath him. All this considered, and the sound still towered over everything. I walked out of the theater believing that I had experienced something unique, something truly special. Interstellar inspires, it awes, and above all it entertains. I cannot ask for more than that.",10.0,Jared_Andrews,2016/04/13,102,83

1252,Moon,"Gerty, we're not programmed. We're people, do you understand?","Directed by Duncan Jones and starring Sam Rockwell, Moon finds Rockwell as Sam Bell who is coming to the end of his three year contract on a lunar station working for Lunar Industries. His only companion is an intelligent computer named GERTY (voiced by Kevin Spacey). When Sam has an accident he awakens to find he is now not alone and all he thought and believed in is just not as it seems. Forget any fears about a low budget and any plot similarity to 2001: A Space Odyssey, for this is a cracker jack of a science fiction picture. Film quickly fills us in on Sam Bell the man and his function up there on the lunar station. His relationship with GERTY the computer grabs our interest whilst the production design has a sort of medicinal sheen to it. Once Sam's solitude is established, the minimal contact with Earth explained, the pic then spins into another dimension, dragging both Sam and us viewers into the vortex. To say more would be churlish, but this is adult science fiction, clever in existential whiles and scathing with observations on corporate shenanigans. Narratively it's evocative in its telling, even haunting and philosophical, where a brilliant Rockwell nails every inch of Bell's search for being, and crucially, the truth. It's all building towards a finale of some devilish substance, no cop outs or easy fed answers, just a pertinent question asked of the viewers. Moon comes highly recommended to sci-fi fans who are after a bit more than mere sparkly fluff and robotic chaos. 9/10",9.0,hitchcockthelegend,2018/12/27,5,3
1253,Intermission,Gritty film about life and love in Ireland.,"This is by no means a ""Hollywood blockbuster"" movie, by which I mean Colin F is not a hunky hero (he is a low-life Irish thug), there is no formula (except sort-of a happy ending) and the people don't look like they never use the loo. It's real, it's funny (not American humour, though - most Americans won't get it, probably) it's sad. Colin gets to be himself, I guess, because he did a great job of his character! And the other actors are well-cast. It starts off in a surprising manner, and although there is quite a bit of violence in this film, I loved the fact the it showed the action and the consequence and not the bits inbetween, ie, if someone got punched, you saw a fist coming and the guy's face afterwards and not the actual contact. That made it far more palatable to me. It's an art film and a typical one at that. Very enjoyable, if you're in an arty mood. If not, stick to the blockbusters.",,Prazzie,2004/04/30,6,0

1257,Ferris Bueller's Day Off,What a day off can do for you!,"When it comes to making films about teenagers, John Hughes is really the only writer and director who can get it right. Some of his incarnations can be very thought provoking like The Breakfast Club. In other cases, they can be downright funny. Ferris Bueller's Day Off is such an example, and manages to be quite inspirational too. Set in Chicago (like all of John Hughes' films), the audience is introduced to Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick). Ferris is a teenager who realises life can be complicated. That is why you're never too old (or too young!) to have a day off. He fakes an illness to his parents with ""a non-specific symptom"", much to the chagrin of his sister Jeanie (Jennifer Grey) who just knows he is faking it. But still, his parents fall for it, hook, line and sinker. They believe their son is an angel who would never lie to them. Once they're gone, then the audience is properly introduced to Ferris Bueller. A hip, trendy, free-wheeling, philosophical spirit who has now been absent from school for a total of nine times in the past semester. One of the nice touches about this film is the way Ferris addresses the audience. He does seem to like to give sermons about how to enjoy life, and some of his observations about life are quite interesting. This derives from his personal philosophy that I must quote: ""Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in awhile, you could miss it."" It is exactly for this reason he wants to take a day off from the monotony of high school. When we actually see some of his lessons, you understand in an instant why. But a day off is no fun on you're own. It is an experience best shared. Ferris wants his best friend Cameron Frye (The superb Alan Ruck) to join him. Cameron is the exact opposite of Ferris. Ferris doesn't worry about anything, and manages to make the impossible possible. Cameron, on the other hand, is a neurotic, paranoid young man who is not in school that day because he genuinely believes he is sick. He is terrified of life, and how it seems to control him. Ferris hopes this day off will help Cameron to reflect and learn to appreciate life instead of running from it. When Ferris (eventually) convinces Cameron to come over to his house, they still have to add one more person into the mix. Ferris' girlfriend Sloane Peterson (Mia Sara) has been invited along too. In a scheme concocted by Ferris, Cameron calls the school pretending to be Sloane's father. This is one of the most hilarious scenes in the film, because his impersonation is so funny it had me in hysterics. It made me wonder if Sloane's father was really like that. Claiming that Sloane's grandmother has passed away, they manage to get one over on the principal Ed Rooney (Jeffrey Jones). He is certain that Ferris is faking his illness, and would like nothing more than to catch him in the act. His purpose in the film is to expose Ferris and failing in every attempt. Once they've got their hands on Cameron's father's Ferrari, a car his dad loves more than life itself (and sadly more than Cameron), Ferris, Cameron and Sloane are ready to go. Once they're in the city, our trio enjoy the sights and sounds. From checking out the Sears building to a baseball game, dining at a fancy restaurant, enjoying modern art, the audience begins to realise this is all for the benefit of Cameron. He's not really enjoying himself, mostly because he's terrified something will happen to the car. Gradually, he does begin to loosen up. Events such as Ferris singing on a parade float help Cameron to do that. That scene is so funny, because the whole crowd join in on Ferris' enthusiasm. It's quite nice as well to see so many people enjoying themselves at once. Cameron eventually manages to bring his perceptions of life into focus. He knows he can't just stand by and let life control him. For too long, he's allowed that to happen. Because his parents have never given him the love and affection he has wanted, and given it to the Ferrari instead, his first act of rebellion is to destroy the car. He is willing to take the blame, because he now wants to be the agent of his own destiny. This is something Ferris has been trying to teach him. Cameron is the real star of the film, and his courage about standing up to his father for wrecking the car is both inspirational and touching. Matthew Broderick is perfect as Ferris Bueller, bringing the boyish charm he is famous for. With people like Jeanie and Rooney against him, and coming out on top, it is hard to dislike him. Although Jeanie learns something from this day too, and becomes a better person for it, like Cameron. This film has a great deal to teach, about how life's moments must be seized, and reflecting on it to make the way for a better future, not only for yourself, but for other people out there like Cameron. It also has a wonderfully surreal touch, that adds a whimsical feeling to the whole enterprise. This is definitely my favourite of John Hughes' teenage films.",10.0,DavidSim240183,2004/02/06,7,4

1259,Death of a Salesman,filled with enough strengths to mostly overpower any complaints,"Volker Schlondorff's adaptation of Arthur Miller's bed-rock of an American tragedy, Death of a Salesman, is one of the best made-for-TV movies of the 80's (odd how it never got a theatrical release though). It gives the star power of Dustin Hoffman in the iconic role of Willy Loman, and for a great theater actor-turned-screen star (though mostly low-key through his career), John Malkovich, and some fine character acting as well. If you've read the play, you might envision something else entirely, and if you've seen it on stage it might bring more disappointment. It is the sort of play you end up going through whether you want to or not in English class(es), particularly in college. It is an important film to see/play to read when you're around this age bracket, as the struggles of Willy and Biff collide alongside each other, and some kind of catharsis needs to come for both- one who's life has almost gone up in smoke, and one who needs to figure it out. It's not worth talking about much of the actual plot or story of the film/play, although it is of note that one of the very best (or at least most effective) scenes for me comes when Willy visits Howard at the office. This exchange, and the drama that unfolds, is a truly heart-breaking little moment, among some others in the film, where you see a collision of ""old-school"" salesmanship and the always now recycling form of BS that goes with the salesman/business world. Really, what's worth talking about is the acting, and certain things with the style, for if you are wanting to check out the film before (or after) seeing the play, it's worth it to know what you'll be in for. In short, Hoffman is quite powerful and true in the film, though in ways that aren't really expectable. An image from reading the play of Willy (that he might be bigger than life, though perhaps little in the mind, and out of shape) might go against a low-energy actor like Hoffman. But somehow, it seems to work, because there's heart and fire in the performance. Same goes for Malkovich, though on a different level. Their scenes together, or on their own, are like watching pro boxers have a go at each other, old timer versus a new champ; there is one other scene, when Biff catches Willy in the hotel room with his 'lady friend' that is likely one of the best scenes either actor has ever done (even if it's questionable if overall the performances are among their best). As far as stylistics go, Schlondorff usually does the right thing: let these actors have their way around, and just try to film it without too much getting in the way. He does this, and at the same time is clever with certain camera sweeps and timing in the narrative (Miller's play was one of the first to jump around, like a novel or even a some films). The music by Alex North is one of my least favorite aspects to th film, as it chimes in some emotional cues that aren't right at all (though when it gets to the jazzy 40's style music then it's not bad). This version of Death of a Salesman is definitely recommended by me, but it may not be the absolute definitive version for some.",9.0,Quinoa1984,2005/10/29,15,13
1260,Horrible Bosses 2,A genuine waste of time.,"I thought the first Horrible Bosses film was good-a bit unpolished in places but basically a good & watchable funny movie. The sequel is actually an awful movie. The first film was flirting with tackiness but never really 'took the plunge' into true tackiness-but this one does. Unless you like jokes about gay men licking other gay mens asses: don't see this film. I think there is some stuff you just shouldn't say in a movie-apparently the producers of this potato don't feel that way. Also the interactions between the three main characters was so hard to watch in many cases in this sequel it made you crave watching a film on brain surgery-it was that crappy. Fortunately the cinema where I saw it took pity on the fact it was such a horrible movie and allowed me to get a refund after I departed the film after about 20 minutes worth of its brain shattering crap. I don't think there has ever been a time where they have made so many nothing movies before and I'm not talking about films like The Interview. Many of the supposedly funny/entertaining films that are more recent are just stupidity like this film. Just avoid it. The thing about that is the spate of dogs that they have been releasing are probably gong to coast some cinemas their businesses. I was the only person at this movie so when I left it was playing to an empty room, and that was in the early evening on a shopping night-the time when most people will take the time to see something at their local cinema.",1.0,lois-lane33,2015/01/08,51,27
1261,Primal Fear,This is THEE Thriller...period!,"Primal Fear will always be on of the best movies I have ever seen. I remember the first time I saw it, I remember each and every subsequent time and each time it's equally as incredible. As thrillers go this is the be all and end all!! Drop dead powerful performances, a moving story, captivating courtroom drama and scenes and an ending that makes The Sixth Sense look predictable. In this review I WILL NOT reveal the ending in any way, shape or form because if you have not yet seen this movie I would never deprive anyone of the incredible shock that this film delivers. Richard Gere is one of my favorite actors, always has been. He has a screen presence rivaled by very few and his performance in Primal Fear is no exception. Martin Vail will always be one of his best performances. Vail is conceited, hopelessly stuck on his own ego. He believes himself to be unparalleled in the world of law and he can't wait to sink his teeth into the media story of the century. A young man and alter boy has been arrested following a brutal murder of a beloved arch bishop. Perplexing thing is this boy is the most soft spoken, stuttering, quiet, innocent boy Vail has ever seen and he immediately sees fame attached to this case. Without a doubt Gere's character goes through the greatest transformation in this film as he quickly discovers the difference between truth and lies, defense and offense and that not everything is black and white. Primal Fear is the story on many levels of people who wear ""masks"", different sides of themselves to different people. Each character wears a different mask throughout the film. Vail wears the mask of being pompous and confident but in fact is scared, fragile, and emotional. The defendant Aaron wears the mask of being the innocent, scared little boy but has the evil alter personality that protects him. Laura Linney's character Janet Venable also wears the mask of being a confident, strong lawyer while in fact feeling her world is falling apart and of course the victim himself Bishop Rushman who to the city was a beloved man who helped many but in fact performed horrible perverted things on his children behind closed doors. Laura Linney is quite good as the rather shaken prosecutor who is really fighting for her job in trying to vindicate Aaron while taking on her former love Vail in the courtroom. She has something to prove and a huge chip on her shoulder and makes for some intense debates in the courtroom between Gere and Linney. Frances McDormand is also very good as Aaron's psychiatrist Dr. Arrington, she's very believable and handles the role with great intelligence. All these amazing performances in this film and they still don't even come fathoms close to touching that of then newcomer Mr. Edward Norton in his Academy Award (and hugely deserved) nominated role as Aaron Stampler and his protective, brash, angry, violent alter personality Roy. Norton is so believable as Stampler and to watch his scary transformation to Roy, his performance draws you in exactly like he's doing for the main characters in the film. You're feeling everything that Martin Vail is feeling as you watch this movie. Every single person's performance in this film is so brilliant that it adds into one amazing film. Other notable smaller performances are Maura Tierney, Alfre Woodard, John Mahoney, and the great Andre Braugher. None of these performances should be ignored. Director Gregory Hoblit at the heart makes a courtroom drama with lots of behind the scenes investigation that puts the action and thrill into the film. But that doesn't stop when it hits the courtroom. The drama and fire ignites in the courtroom with the battle back and forth, further facts, new evidence, a story unfolding before us about this Bishop and his brutal murder. From beginning to end this is one entertainment at it's absolute best. In my opinion I state this as one of the greatest films ever period!! It's absolutely one of my top ten for certain. It's just powerful, moving, well acted and thrilling. It's exactly what you want a film to be...it's what movies are all about.

Now the first Horrible Bosses did have some moments that make you go ""Really""? but it was still enjoyable but this one Oh My God it is just uninspiring. What were they thinking for this!? I mean the jokes in this film are so awful and pretty much disrespectful the comedy is just plain awful it just feels the writers didn't care as long as it made money. Well the cast from the first film reprise their roles for the film it is just not enough to save the film from burning in the movie eternal fire pits it deserves to burn in. The plot for the film is just so stupid that it makes the film unbearable to even consider paying attention to it. And don't get me started on the acting, the cast couldn't find an performance in this film with both hands and a map all I can say is that they must have gotten a big paycheck to star in this film, they perform so badly that they should have consider making this a direct to video release because I've seen TV movies with better acting then this film because they just act so awful that you would want to scream. Horrible Bosses 2 should have been called Awful Writing and Performance because I pretty much lost respect for those who started in this movie. If you have any love for films and comedy films you will avoid this film at all cost it isn't even bad comedy it Terrible Comedy.

1263,Pulp Fiction,If you only ever watch 1 Tarantino film make it this one,"I like to think that any Hollywood director who dedicated their life to making movies can look back at one film and think ""At least I made my mark"". Kubrick had 2001, Scorsese will have Goodfellas and Tarantino, well, he'll have Pulp Fiction. I watched this film on release, when all we really knew about Tarantino was Reservoir Dogs. It's hard for me to think what someone viewing it more than a quarter of a century later would make of it. Hopefully it can be viewed in context and see how revolutionary the film really was. One striking thing, which was quite novel at the time, is how the scenes aren't shown chronologically. What at first seems like a gimmick makes more and more sense as the film progresses and on repeat viewings. The impact of the storytelling would have been nowhere near as great if told in a more traditional way. If you're new to Tarantino then lucky you, you've got some great movies to watch. You won't go wrong by starting with Pulp Fiction.",10.0,ChubbyChecker,2020/04/09,7,6
1264,Crash,Despicable,"""Crash"" is not the best picture of the year; the Academy got it wrong, which wouldn't be the first time. If you're reading this and have not seen the film ""Crash"" I suggest you stop reading and watch the film so that you, the home viewer, can formulate your own opinion about the film prior to reading this entry. OK now, everybody else ready? Here we go: First and foremost this film is about 12 separate people in present day Los Angeles and their trials and tribulations during a 36-hour period. Though they all have never met before, each will eventually ""crash"" into one another and learn a valuable lesson about life. The overall moral of the film is not to stereotype others and end all racist connotations. So how does the film go about conveying this message? BY MAKING ALL 12 CHARACTERS IN THE FILM A RACIAL STEREOTYPE AND HAVING EACH CHARACTER STEREOTYPE ALL THE OTHER 11 CHARACTERS IN THE FILM!! WHAT KIND OF OXYMORONIC CRAP IS THAT?! This film wants to break down all stereotypes by making everyone in it a stereotype without any explanation of what, why, or how. Does this make any sense at all? None of the characters are decent people in the film (except for one, the Mexican!) due to their negative traits and negative actions. Plus the fact that there are 12 separate stories means the audience member can never understand the rhyme nor reason to each character's traits (which is easy, lazy, despicable writing to say the least). The viewer has no way to empathize with any of the characters in the film. So then why should the audience member give a damn about anything happening on screen? On top of that, there are some technical reasons why this film isn't the best picture of the year, most of which you can read on the ""Goofs"" section of IMDb. Oh, and it won for best editing as well. Way to go Academy! All in all this is a poor film, lazily written, poorly produced, and conveying a message that the messengers themselves don't understand due to the stereotypes that they represent.",1.0,YBEazy,2006/03/06,64,38
1265,Interstellar,I Question Humanities Future Based On The Reviews This Movie Is Getting...,"This movie is genius... What? Seriously? First off, possible spoilers, although I'm mostly going to try to avoid them. Second off, SERIOUSLY??? Third, it's not really a one star movie. It's like 5-7ish depending on how you want to weight various factors. I'm just doing this because all the hype, and all the ""stellar"" (pun intended) reviews are blowing my mind and need to be balanced out. This movie is OK. I'm a sci-fi geek, and an apocalypse movie geek. This was kind of supposed to have both, so how could I go wrong? Easily apparently. If you like movies that actually make sense, this film is not for you. If you have any common sense or a logical brain you'll know what I mean when you see it. For me this film falls into the ""big flashy substance free summer blockbuster"" category, aside from the fact that it was released in fall. If you like big flashy special effects movies with no substance you'll probably love it, because you're OK with just going for the ride. If you like movies that make sense and have cohesive plots, you will likely be irritated when this strays from those lofty goals... And stray it does. A lot. He TRIED to make a great movie, but ended up with one that doesn't quite get there. This movie, like so many movies with generally promising plots falls down all over the place in the execution... Or more specifically, the script itself. Special effects were killer with lots of great visuals. All the ""directing"" portions of the movie were well done. So I suppose I can say Nolan did a great job directing the movie. All the actors were just fine... The problem was with what they were told to act out. So Nolan did not do a good job as writer. Perhaps he should stick to directing which he is quite good at. Let me say this, I'm NOT a pompous, arrogant guy in real life. But sometimes I wonder if having a couple dozen IQ points over average just RUINS films for me. So many movies have everything this one does. Good basic premise. Good acting. Great special effects. Horrible scripts that make absolutely no sense for anyone with a brain. So where to begin? In my opinion a huge percentage of movies, especially sci-fi, require that you accept a basic premise. Many of them do not make sense. This can be OK. You just have to roll with it even if it's a little off. Think zombie movies. I love zombies... But really with the setup/explanation of how most zombie viruses spread, and how awesome our military is, and how slow zombies are (or even if they're fast zombies), it's a ridiculous premise. The mess would last about a week, and then get under control. How exactly does a zombie take out an Abrams tank again??? But I roll with it. This movie's basic premise is slightly flawed, but not so much so that it HAS to completely ruin the movie. There are cases where the basic idea is so bad I can't get past it, but this isn't one. Earth is basically overwhelmed by bad weather, and crop killing plagues. It happens in real life. The Dust Bowl was rough, and so was the Irish potato famine. The truth is that we could deal with those easily on Earth, but let us pretend we couldn't and move on. My problem is with the endless series of things that either outright don't make any sense, or things where you have to stretch it pretty far mentally and basically ""cover up"" for the writing by buying into implausible, silly reasons for things. How exactly does everyone still drive around gas guzzling trucks, and yet are enthralled by a few small solar panels they can pull off of a UAV? How do they have all this infrastructure for pointless things, yet they can't keep control of said UAV, or like make parts for their robotic farm equipment they rig up from scraps? That's the first like 2 seconds of the movie. This movie is a death of a thousand cuts. Going point by point would take way too long. In my opinion this movie didn't have any ""deal killer"" plot holes. As in no one thing completely made my head instantly explode. But what did happen was by the end of the 2nd hour there were so many little silly things piling up that it just went beyond the pale. There's plenty to be desired in terms of the time dilation stuff making sense, but most of it does if you think it through logically and do the math. Perhaps not 100% though. To me it just had a general vibe of meh with a lot of little stuff. Then there's the non logical portion of the story, AKA the human story, also being meh. It's like they kind of want you to think Cooper and Brand had a love thing maybe? Or at least Cooper does for her... But then no development. But then he rushes off at the end after her... Is that a platonic hero thing, or was that supposed to be the big romance story? You don't even know because it was such a mess. It's not that the actors couldn't have acted it out fine, but it just doesn't happen. I found myself not really caring about any of them much because none of them were developed. Cooper was a pretty cool dude, but other than that I didn't take a lot away. That's it. I'm done typing. In short feel free to watch it, but just be forewarned if you have an analytical mind that you will find many portions of the movie causing minor brain aneurysms.",1.0,Not_An_Idiot,2014/11/11,444,197
1266,The Green Mile,The Green Mile was excellent!,"My Plot Summary: The Green Mile, set in the 1930s, is about the mental and physical health effects of working on death row. In this film the guards encounter many different men that have been put to death for various crimes. It isn't until they come across a black gentleman that has been falsely accused of raping and murdering two young girls, that they begin to really have second thoughts about execution. This inmate has the magnificent gift of healing through his faith. A mix of the inmate's gift, and the fact that he is innocent, causes the guards to question whether or not this man should be executed. The situations a person encounters in their profession can affect them for the rest of their lives. Paul Edgecomb, played by Tom Hanks, is the supervisor on death row, a dimly lit, dungeon-like building. Edgecomb has suffered major effects from the many executions that he has taken part in. He encounters a once in a lifetime experience when John Coffey, played by Michael Clarke Duncan, is sent to the Green Mile to await his execution. John Coffey is a very large and intimidating man that is extremely soft at heart. All this man wants is peace in his life from all of the hurt that is going on in the world around him. He has been blessed with the gift of healing. While he tries to help all he can he learns that it is impossible to help everyone. Paul Edgecomb's fellow prison guards are of varying personalities. Brutus Howell, played by David Morse, is a large man who has been given the nickname ""Brutal"" due to his size. In spite of the fact that he is a tall man, and somewhat intimidating, he is a kind man that comes to second guess the ruling for the execution of John Coffey. Percy Wetmore, played by Doug Hutchison, is an all around jerk who is all bark and no bite. This is proved when one of the more violent inmates grabs hold of one of his co-workers while he stands there shaking in his boots. Percy's interaction with the inmates causes John Coffey to dislike him. As a result, John Coffey has decided to ""infect"" Percy with an ailment that he cured a person of. Percy lashes out on another inmate, kills him, and then releases his ""infection."" Percy, in the end, ends up going to a mental hospital. My Review: The Green Mile, starring Tom Hanks, David Morse, and Michael Clarke Duncan, is a brilliantly written and produced piece of work. The choice of actors and actresses along with their exquisite performances could not have been better. The lighting and angles made the viewing of the movie a one of a kind experience. The artistic dimness of the lights, and dull colors within the walls of the Green Mile made this film all the more believable. It gives the viewers the sense of doom and dread that is felt by the inmates knowing that their lives are soon coming to an end because of the crimes they have committed. John Coffey, played by Michael Clarke Duncan, delivered the most convincing, amazing, and overall ground breaking performance in this film. In spite of his extra large stature, Coffey is a kind, soft hearted man who brings a lot of heart-felt emotion to the Green Mile. The attachment that the guards develop to Coffey makes it extremely hard for them to carry out his execution; there was not a dry eye amongst the guards. This film shows that any situation that is encountered in a person's profession, whether it is mental or physical, can affect them for the remainder of their lives. These men face the biggest moral obstacle they will ever come across in their lifetimes. When asked by Paul Edgecomb how he is to answer for the execution of John Coffey, he is assured by the large, gifted inmate that it is OK to execute him, that it will end his pain and he wants it to be carried out. All he wants is to end the feelings he has every day because of all of the violence and hurt in the world around him. This film is, by far, one of the best movies that I have seen in a very long time. There was laughter, tears, and amazement throughout the entirety of this film. The performance of the cast of The Green Mile was above and beyond my expectations of a film that deals with a prison setting. Tom Hanks, along with the many other actors and actresses will leave you begging for more. If you have not seen this brilliant piece of work, then it should be added to your list of must see movies for the year because it is guaranteed to please! If you liked Shawshank Redemption you will love this.",9.0,thompd09,2011/04/29,4,3
1267,Moon,half way between solaris and space-odyssey,"I was led to this movie, partly because of a sort of dissatisfaction from what we've known as science fiction due to Star-Treks, Star wars, terminators and transformers. On my visit to the local independent movie theater, I was only expecting something like Apollo 13 and I would've been satisfied with just that. But the movie proved to be much more. It wasn't just the cinematography, few captivating shots of the moon surface, or the great acting performance. It was as if the movie took a while to ponder over philosophical questions that science and technology raise- something that every science fiction ought to do. This work won't be unworthy of a comparison with Kubrick's- space odyssey – only that it is probably not as visually stimulating as the latter. It does make good use of classical music like Kubrick's. I found the movie to be a bit more accessible than Tarkovsky's Solaris in that it is much more fluid and entertaining (Solaris was 3 hr long – executed very slow albeit with a similar idea). Like Solaris, the protagonist's recollections of the life on earth eventually result in some mental instability, but the movie stays away from getting into long philosophical debates on human experience or our place on earth. In general, do expect a lot more than space travel in this movie. To cite an example, the isolation of Sam made him more attached to memories of his life on earth. I don't recall many other movies that have expressed it so well that in isolation, nothing really means anything. Kudos to the director! Such existentialist reflections aside, there are many instances when the movie makes a statement about unethical corporate practices, evasive HR responses - almost to the extent 'Michael Clayton' did. I think that makes it more worthwhile to watch. Still despite all that, it avoids taking any stances on controversies that bother all of us in modern times. It puts us through the fears of the unknown, catastrophes of distrust and what arises from distrust and isolation and all of that. Still, somehow the movie isn't really as dark as the script might make it sound. There is isolation, mistrust, schemes, confusion, curiosities and despair, but the human experience probably transcends the realism of its existence – that was the idea I carried back from the movie theater.",8.0,anuragr,2009/06/30,277,221
1268,Moon,boring and predictable,"This movie starts out pretty good. The moon setting and the idea of isolation from the rest of humanity is a tried and tested plot. However the movie became extremely predictable right after the rover crash and the clone was shown for the first time. The one thing going for this movie was that it was not regurgitation of the 2001 space odyssey man vs machine. But even the aspect of a helpful computer (Gerdy). Gerdy in the beginning won't answer Sam's questions and then about half way through he 'decides' that he will tell Sam the whole conspiracy that the lunar company is trying to pull off. All and all, this movie was boring, predictable, and fits right in with Hollywood's sup par film making that has regrettably become the norm.",4.0,thewall-06,2012/01/01,34,16
1269,Blackfish,SeaWorld's Nemesis,"Blackfish is an extraordinary film that captures aspects of Orcas both in the wild and in captivity. The film uses research of Orcas in the wild against the conditions they are kept in while in confinement. In doing so it does an impressive job at opening your eyes to the dark side of captivity. Orcas, also referred to as Killer Whales, are often thought to be friendly, loving and intelligent creatures. This is the case in the wild, but not in long-term captivity. Blackfish takes a look at the conditions Killer Whales are kept in at the glorious theme parks, which just happen to turn them into money making slaves. Orcas are meant to be wild animals, and training them to perform tricks against their will to earn food—which they need to survive—is just immoral. The film allows us to see the mind-turning process in multiple video clips of not only the training sessions, but also of the whale's performances. The film's main focus is on a Killer Whale named Tillikum. It follows Tillikum beginning from when he was captured to his current stay at every kid's wonderland, SeaWorld. Tillikum's past is filled with mistreatment, abuse, and underestimation. After being captured Tillikum went to stay at a park called Sea Land. It should have been called Sea Tank, because that's what it was. He was kept in an atrociously small metal pool, nowhere suitable for his size. During his stay at this park, he participated in the killing of a trainer. The film shows an interview of two women who were viewing the show the day this tragedy happened, and revealed that Tillikum may have not just participated, but ""initiated"" the killing. Right after the killing he was purchased by SeaWorld, who knowingly took him despite the horrific event. SeaWorld claims they did not know of the tragedy. If they didn't know, why did they caution the trainers not to get too close to him? SeaWorld unsuccessfully tried to keep this tragedy from reoccurring. The film covers the 2010 news story of Dawn Brancheau being killed by no other than Tillikum himself. SeaWorld tried to revise the story by saying it was Dawn's error, not Tillikum acting out. After Blackfish was released, SeaWorld fired back saying that they had never blamed Dawn for her death. Although the film clearly contains an interview of a SeaWorld executive saying, ""If Dawn was here she would agree with me that it was her error."" The film shows how Tillikum has been brutally treated by both his fellow whale companions and by the parks themselves. Neither the film nor I claim that SeaWorld or any other park abuses their animals physically, but they are mentally tortured. The film features a news segment showing Jane Velez-Mitchell making the controversial remark, ""If you were kept in a bathtub for 25 years, don't you think you'd get a little psychotic?"" The producer's decision to include this segment was an extremely good one; it points out the flaws in captivity. How can you morally take a wild animal--which is supposed to be able to roam freely--and stick them in an enclosed tank with animals not of their family? That's right, the whales at SeaWorld are not a big happy family as SeaWorld has made the public believe in for quite some time. Despite the name ""Killer Whales,"" these creatures are very family oriented animals. In the wild, they stay with their family their whole lives. Whale hunters have ripped these families apart to turn them into show monkeys. The film features actual footage showing hunters capturing these beautiful creatures and splitting them from their family. Not only does this process affect the captured animal, it affects the family who has now lost one of their loved ones. A lot of times the capturing of the whales leads to some of the family members dying as well. Blackfish exposes SeaWorld for the lies it has told. The film provides footage of SeaWorld employees informing customers that Orcas live to be 25-30 in the wild, so they live much longer in captivity. This is an outright, boldfaced lie. Research has shown that in the wild Orcas have a life expectancy equal to humans, if not longer. While this film does effectively uncover the horrific side of captivity, it has its flaws, as does everything. It does not show the positive outcomes of captivity, such as being kept from whale hunters' harm (ironically how they got there in the first place). The only good part of captivity to me would be if they were taken from the wild due to an illness or injury. That would justify captivity, because then it would be ""rehabilitation."" After being in captivity for a certain period of time they should be released back into the wild. Arguments against the film could be that they did not use the correct footage during some parts of the movie; like the segment showing a trainer jumping onto a whale for a ride. During this part the film shows a former trainer talking about her first ride on a whale when she was in no way experienced for it. She was not the trainer in the video clip. To me this is not a big error because it still shows a trainer boarding a whale for a joy ride. The film was full of bias, but it was set to accomplish a goal and it fulfilled it. This film will either rip your heart out, or have you saying ""Liar, Liar."" I wasn't the latter. After viewing Blackfish I cannot think of SeaWorld as a safe haven anymore. Blackfish set out to expose SeaWorld and it effectively did so. It is by far my favorite documentary.",9.0,ampercussion,2014/11/16,5,4

1273,The Wailing,One of the most significant movies within the genre in recent years!,"Goksung (original title) or The Wailing (English title), the new film from South Korean director and writer Hong-jin Na (known for Chugyeogja - Chaser - 2008 and Hwanghae - The Yellow Sea - 2010), is already considered one of the great works in the horror genre, addressing a macabre part of eastern culture on legends, curses, evil spirits and mysticism, being one of the highlights at the Cannes Film Festival. Coincidentally after the arrival of a stranger, a strange disease begins to spread in the small village of Goksung, triggering a series of brutal murders. What at first appears to be only crimes of passion just takes darker contours, since all deaths occur in mysterious circumstances. In charge of the investigation, the police officer Jong-Goo (played by Do Won Kwak, known for Ajeossi - The Man From Nowhere - 2010) searches for clues and explanations to the tragic events. When his daughter, Hyo-jin (played by Kim Hwan-hee), begins to feel the strange symptoms of the disease, he has to fight against time to solve the mysterious case and save her life. With a rhythmic narrative, The Wailing presents a folk story associated with Eastern mysticism and also the occultism, marked by elements of mystery, horror and supernatural, as guardians, demons and shamans, and the unfolding of the plot gradually gets more intense and disquieting contours. The technical quality is one aspect that stands out in the movie. The picture and the soundtrack provide an immersive and engaging combination as ambiance, expressed by constant rain, the mud, the precariousness of the small village, the striking features of a small town, as well as makeup and massacre scenarios, consolidate the mystical and eerie atmosphere of the film, expanding the mystery and holding the viewer's attention. The script plays well with expectations, building some characters in a dubious way, without specifying their actual intentions. A relatively simple story is presented in a complex and intriguing way, where apparently scenes with no great purpose show us much, requiring attention to small details, whether occult symbols or religious references (Biblical). Crows and goat's head are used throughout the narrative, symbolizing death and evil omen and referring to the profane and witchcraft. The film manages to build an atmosphere of terror without abusing the typical genre tricks. The moments of humor are used to softer the approach of a subject that in itself is already quite tense. Here it is worth mentioning the great performance of Do Won Kwak in the caricatured role of the lazy, fumbling and fearful police officer, though well intentioned. With a competent job of the cast, efficient direction creating an atmosphere that blends mystery, horror and comedy as well as providing much reflection with an end open to different interpretations and also for its originality, The Wailing is one of the most significant movies within the genre in recent years.",9.0,Vikingbyheart,2016/10/21,45,20
1274,Crash,Not as good as they would have you believe...,"**Contains Spoilers** I was intrigued by the first half of this movie. We have a police officer sexually assaulting a black woman, his indignant partner, a pair of carjacking black youths, an Asian man hit by a car, a Persian convenience store owner (how original), and a prosperous white couple who turn out to be rather unsavoury. The movie baits you with these characters, making you wonder what will happen to them and how their behaviour will be repaid. Then we get to the second half. While the beginning of the movie nicely sets up some scenarios that make us curious, the second half hinges on consequences that are too unbelievable to swallow. The sex offender cops saves the woman he molested. The WASP woman who is ""always angry"" falls down stairs and must be cared for by her Hispanic maid. The good black policeman purgers himself in order to cover up a warrant out for his brother, who coincidentally is shot to death by the idealistic young cop who stood up for his principles. The poor Asian man, hit by a car, turns out to be trafficking Cambodian nationals for a Triad gang. And the car thief finds the van full of Cambodians, steals it, and ends up setting them free after being offered roughly $5000 for them. Right... ***Spoilers End*** Okay, we get it. Good people do bad things, and bad people do good things. Nice premise, but did we need to be hit over the head with it over and over again? And couldn't the writer find less coincidental means of revealing the moral of the story? Perhaps the writer should have spent less time attempting to write a Pulp Fiction morality tale and more time fleshing out his characters in order to make them more believable and less one-sided. Because in the end, no matter what they do, they can still be described in simplistic terms. Racist. Car Thief. WASP. Idealistic Cop. Family Man. And so on.",3.0,descendant_x,2006/04/17,29,19

I thought this movie was a real treat for Spider-Man fans, it was excellent, with lots of energy to entertain the audience and has a few twists and turns. Better than the first, it made good progress since then, this movie is more complex and exciting than the first, so you can see a big difference when you put this movie and the first together. Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is facing more stress than ever, after two years of saving the world, life becomes more harder for him. He's been fired from his job, the newspapers says that Spider-Man is a criminal, Peter is not doing so well at school, his true love has been engaged to another man, his friendship with Harry is falling apart as Harry wants revenge on Spider-Man for killing his father and a scientist called Doctor Octavious does a fusion experiment but it leads to failure and he turns into a villain with four tentacles controlling him. This time, Peter must learn to control both of his two lives and he must find time to save the world and also try and live a normal life as a college student. But as the world needs Spider-Man's help as Doctor Octavious starts destroying and killing the city, Peter must make a choice of who he's going to be, Peter or Spider-Man... The performances, script, special effects were all amazingly brilliant. So well done. Overall, a great movie, with special effects were out-of-this-world, the performances that were outstanding, but a little work needs to be done on the plot : it needs cutting down, if it were 5 minutes shorter it would have been a masterpiece.

1277,Primal Fear,Amazing film.,"Primal Fear tells the story of a seemingly harmless altar boy who is accused of murdering Chicago's most beloved archbishop. Big shot lawyer Martin Vail takes the case to prove his client's innocence, and ends up digging up clues that prove the archbishop wasn't so great. He also discovers that due to his client's repressed personality, he has developed a second, more brutal personality. Now the lawyer wants the insanity plea, and to prove that the archbishop brought on his own murder. This is an intense courtroom drama, and a very well made film that makes you think. This movie is one of the best courtroom dramas/thrillers out there. It is well made with a chilling plot and great dialogue. The style in which the film is made reminds me of the classic mystery/courtroom films, except with a darker, more modern twist. The movie is dark and violent, but it never goes too far over the top to push people away. It's a movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat until the final shocking scene. The acting is great. Richard Gere is as good as always as the big shot lawyer. This is Edward Norton's first film, and you can tell straight away that he was going somewhere. He is amazingly talented. Overall, this is a chilling film, and I recommend it to anyone who likes a good thriller, a good courtroom drama, or a plain old good movie. 9/10",9.0,theshadow908,2006/06/27,2,2
1278,Intermission,Intersecting Intermissions,"What a truly interesting film containing several seemingly unrelated story lines that eventually intersect, physically and emotionally, toward the conclusion. We have large doses of typical urban problems such as extra-marital affairs, drug pandering, sexual, romantic and emotional conflicts, hooliganism, etc. Sounds like rather typical film fodder except for the manner in which John Crowley and Mark O'Rowe respectively execute their directorial and writing skills in putting together this tightly woven comedy/drama. The dialog is rife with articulate and extremely witty banter in the unmistakable Celtic manner. The execution of that dialog and the intersecting story lines is carried out in grand fashion by all these extremely gifted actors. Nobody, even in the smaller roles, misses a beat in this well-timed piece. As these various story line ""intermissions"" come to a close, will emotions cool down and some semblance of peace and normality prevail?

Given that, I was somewhat embarrassed to have reached 38 years old and not managed to see a film much ballyhooed as a classic. Instead, I should have been thankful. It's not just that the pacing is slow, the music vaguely irritating, and the story lacking. The problem is that a character study needs to be about someone who *has* a character. We need to see development and we need to care about them. Travis doesn't have a well defined character. His mental instability ebbs and flows, is never properly defined (probably a good idea from the director's viewpoint), and his actions seem random rather than prompted by illness. Does rejection by a ""good"" person make him re-classify everyone as bad and lead to his vigilante-ism? Or is he attempting to re-cast Iris as a ""good"" person? Who knows? Certainly not the viewer as no clues are given. Even if we draw a veil over that issue, and the ludicrous idea that he would be seen as a hero for deliberately killing several people, the lack of rationale for, well, anything, makes empathy with the title character impossible. Frankly, there is no reason to care what happens to him, and so, ultimately, no reason to watch this movie. ""Rocky"" roundly trounced Taxi Driver at the Oscars.

1280,Moon,how to make a great movie,"You don't need a big budget, big name actors, big studio, big special effects for a good movie... you need a good story, great acting, good directing, good camera work, good cuts, good sound... and all of this can be found in this film. Yes, OK, I admit it, I like the genre, but what a pleasant surprise this film is. I'm so glad I made the effort to travel 30 miles to go and see it. This film won various awards and I would not be surprised if there were quite a few more in store. Details... Sam Rockwell's performance was 100% or shall I say 200%? What a talent he is, very believable, he made me care about the character he was portraying, and he moved me deeply. The story was very good and brought up a few troubling issues, no, not nightmarish stuff, but just things that we as society should really think about before going forward, 'just because it can be done doesn't mean we should do it'.. and I think this film will have added to the discussion just like GATTACA and others like it. I am glad I saw this film, it was an enriching experience.",10.0,andres-kruse,2009/08/20,9,5
1281,The Wailing,One of the Best Korean Movie,"The Wailing (Gokseong in Korean) is a 2016 South Korean horror movie directed by Na Hong-Jin. The movie is set in a little village in the mountains of South Korea and it's about a police officer named Jong- Goo (Kwak Do-hon) who investigates a series of mysterious killings and illnesses. At first the police department thinks that killings is just a normal kind of killing, but as time passes and more bodies being found, Jong-goo knows that something is wrong. A mysterious disease starts spreading among the villagers, causing a rash which precedes violent murderous outbreaks followed by stupor and eventually death! When Jong-goo's daughter is also become sick like the others, the main story of the movies begins. He see a girl with white dress in front of one of the victims house that she claims she knows who is responsible for this disease and killing, a Japanese stranger who lives in a cabin in the woods... I highly recommend The Wailing to horror movie fans who liked movies Rosemary's Baby, I Saw the Devil and The Exorcist. It has a combination of those three movies but in a new and strange way in 2016! You always guess one thing gonna happen, but the movie shows that in another way, specially at the end of the movie all of your guesses might be wrong... or maybe right! The actors played very good and Kwak Do-hon nailed it as a father and a policeman. It had only one problem that maybe it's just my problem : Running Time. The movie is 156 minutes, for a horror movie it was really long and the tempo and rhythm of the movie in the middle was slow. Maybe if they did a better editing and cut the non-important parts, it would've became a perfect horror movie in all aspects. Anyway, The Wailing is one of the best horror movies that I watched in a couple years and if you're a fan of this kind of movies, you're gonna love it!",8.0,KhashayarEmamifard,2017/07/30,10,4
1282,Blackfish,Seaworld and killer whales.,"My new favorite documentary! Although it is probably one of the most heart breaking things you will ever watch, Blackfish has truly opened my eyes to the world we are living in. This film focuses on killer whale named Tilikum, who is performing daily at the Seaworld in Orlando, FL. Even if you are not interested in marine life or any animals for that matter, this film is still extremely educational. You will definitely learn something from it! Animals deserve the same rights as a human being and should not be kept captive for our entertainment. As an animal lover, my hope is that this film inspires watchers to start making changes.",10.0,ari-liuzzi,2013/10/28,17,14
1283,The Wailing,This movie is painful to watch so far,"I see a lot of positive reviews for this movie have a hard time understanding why it's so enjoyable. This is now the second time I've tried to sit through watching it and have given up about halfway through. Is it supposed to be a comedy or is all the goofy antics of the main character(s) unintentional? It's like the movie is trying to be serious/heavy but the hero is straight out of Dumb and Dumber. Can someone explain these questions? -Why are these police officers so inept? I've seen volunteer neighborhood watch citizens with more bearing. They're just a bunch of bumbling fools. Like the scene where they investigate the burned up house. All of the police officers just stand around while a woman attacks another officer??? -These are supposed to be police! Why are they hiding under their desk when that woman appears in the doorway to their station??? They act like 10 year olds scared at a boogeyman, not grown adults supposed to enforce the laws. -I'm at the scene where they investigate the house and one of the officers found a room full of evidence. So what happens when the owner comes back? They hang their heads in shame like kids caught with their hand in the cookie jar. Who cares if you broke in, you just basically solved the whole mystery right there. The next scene you see a police car driving down a road and thinking ""It's about time they pulled their heads out of their asses and called for backup."" Nope, of course not. Instead we have a bunch more bumbling idiot Dumb and Dumber detectives. ""What you're saying doesn't make sense?"" Then pull the police car over and figure out what's going on with your partner??? He's obvious in distress, why are we taking this so lightly? Why does every adult male act like a castrated wimp? These are police but act like a bunch of scared children. They obviously can't handle a serious police investigation so why are they placed in charge? What am I missing here? Like I said, I'm about an hour in and this is the furthest I've been able to watch before wanting to rip my hair out. It's like this movie can't figure out what it wants to be. The movie tagline should be: A slapstick comedy about two bumbling and stammering police officers trying to solve a horrific serial killer case. Even a Woody Allen type character has more bearing than these buffoons.",5.0,Regulatori,2017/09/05,7,3
1284,Goodfellas,how can a masterpiece be underrated? here's how...,"Goodfellas is one of the top movies in the history of cinema, nominated for best picture (and five other Oscars) considered by many the top movie of the 90s, so how can it be underrated. put simply, it is underrated because the Godfather (parts I and II) are so brilliant. The sad thing is that, because Goodfellas is a gangster movie, it will always be compared to other gangster movies. for some reason, movies in that genre (gangster/organized crime) are never looked at as individual pictures, but are forever compared and put up against other gangster films. The only exception to this rule, is the godfather of all gangster movies, the Godfather. this is probably because it is the first of its kind (not the first gangster movie, but the first modern-style gangster movie), most gangster movies made after the Godfather are complete rip offs of the Godfather, but every once in a while a movie like Goodfellas comes along that may be similar to on the surface, but is then written off by many. when I say, written off, I mean that it is not getting the credit it deserves. it is a masterpiece, yes it is a gangster picture, no it is not the Godfather. Many people admire it for what it is, but if the Godfather hadn't been made, or even if this film wasn't always compared to it, it would take its deserved place in cinema history. that place is not as a good film, and a great gangster film, it is a artful, entertaining, and near flawless film, and one of the top two greatest gangster films.",10.0,rockybalboa2430,2005/06/28,5,3
1285,Interstellar,watch if your local pharmacy has run out of nytol.,"it seems that most people write their very first review after seeing the worst film of their lives, or after seeing the best. this is my first, driven to review to give a more honest rating and review than a 9.1. if you want to learn about physics, watch a documentary. if you want to be bored out of your mind for hours on end, then go and see interstellar. lead character mumbles 80% of the time (i thought it was just my hearing after being blasted with noise during the film at first). the use of sound is clever the first time, brash and loud, then deadly silent. but then it quickly becomes over used. scenes are so long and drawn out, this seems like a film a director wanted to make for his own viewing and ego. anne hathaway just looks tearful (you know the scene in snow white when she wandering about the forest scared of everything?) all of the time. I've never walked out of a film, and sadly couldn't this time (i didn't want to disturb the sleeping people around me you see...). if id been on an aisle seat, id have been gone after an hour. its not that the film is 'too clever', its just utterly boring.",1.0,ultrapoi,2014/11/11,189,87
1286,Crash,Cinematic disaster,"Question: why is this movie still on the top 250? This is one of the few movies in the top 250 that has negative reviews right when you click the more bottom on the bottom of the front page where the spotlight review is. If you can stop believing in Santa Claus, Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy, then why cant you see this movie is the worst movie on racism ever produced? Old habits die hard I guess. For the record I'm not some inbred hick that hates any movie that deals with racism. I respect every movie that dealt with racism prior to this movie. Crash received all its hype because the Academy Awards did not want to see Brokeback Mountain. There I said it. Its no secret that the Academy Awards are paid bandwagoneers. If there is money involved they will oversell any movie to death. If you recognize that fact and still give them the benefit of the doubt then you need to get your head checked. Crash plays like a glorified, PC to the extreme, TV movie on race. The main thing that made better movies on race relations in the past great is that the characters in them are realistic. Look at Mississippi Burning and American History X. Are the people in those movies realistic? Yes. Now look at Crash. Are the people in Crash realistic? Of course not. These people talk about race 100% of the time. I'm sorry but even the most of hardcore racist will not talk about race 100% of the time nor would they do the stupid things the people in this movie do. With the exception of Ryan Phillipe, Terrence Howard and Michael Pena, the performances were laughable and weak. Matt Dillon should have been perfect as the racist cop John Ryan but to say he was unbelievable is putting it nicely. When he groped Thandie Newton's butt in a traffic stop I had to hold back laughter. I was waiting for her to pass gas to give this scene the hilarity it deserves. Did the writers think that was supposed to be an effective scene? Please. Show him zapping her with a taser gun or beating her down and then you would have a more accurate description of what a racist cop would do and a more effective scene. Sandra Bullock was equally unbelievable in her role. I laughed my a** off when she fell down those flights of stairs. Ludicrous's character fails big time because we all know he has no depth to his character. Just listen to his albums. Larenz Tate is slumming in his performance and Don Cheadle phones it in. The writing stinks too because as I said earlier the people are unrealistic as well as the situations they are in. I cant believe for one second that John Ryan would rescue Christine from a car accident after he fondled her buttocks in front of her husband and neither should you. The thing that sad the most about Crash is that after its done you are left wondering what the hell you just watched. The best movies on race leave the viewer with something they will never forget. This movie leaves you with nothing but unitentional humor. There are better movies out there that deserve a spot on the top 250. Why is this movie still here? Better movies on racism: Magnolia, America History X, Do The Right Thing, Bamboozled, and Mississippi Burning. Hell I'll even take Higher Learning any day over this garbage movie.",1.0,blackaugust79,2009/11/14,27,18
1287,Spider-Man 2,Better than the original,"One word: brilliant. The first one was good. But after seeing this one, I didn't want to leave the theater. The entire cast from the original has outdone themselves in this one. However, the best performance is probably Alfred Molina as Doctor Octopus. And the special effects are realistic. Especially the tentacles scene in the emergency room. This one has improved upon everything from the original. There's more action and emotion in this one. And the ending with Harry discovering the Goblin's lair is excellent, foreshadowing, and even scary. As soon as I left the theater, I went home and began waiting for the DVD release.

I love a good weepy film and I was looking forward to a hungover Sunday afternoon cry but instead I was just wanting the film to end. So, what went wrong? I would say that the main reason is that Hazel is just not a likable character. Gus was just about likable but I felt nothing for Hazel, throughout the whole film she seemed cold and distant, something about her just didn't work. I'm not sure if something was lost when it went from book to screen but something happened (or didn't). At 2hrs 6 mins it was just too long.. KISSING IN ANNE FRANKS HOUSE?! What the f....? And then to be clapped for it? What? I almost cheered Willem Defoe's character for attempting to take Hazel down a peg or two which, I may add, was the only good thing to happen during the abysmal Amsterdam part of the film. This just bored me and the only way it almost got any kind of tears out of me was from me mourning the 2 hours of my precious weekend I just wasted on this tripe.

What do you expect when the likes of Jason Bateman and Jason Sudeikis steer comedy together with their brilliant comic timing? Charlie Day beams you up with his clumsiness and keeps the humour alive. All of them are really funny. What makes Bateman unique is that he is the only sane person in the group trying to jack-hammer some sense into his moronic buddies whilst Jason and Charlie keep driving into the inane all the time. Both Christoph Waltz and Chris Pine wear the wicked veil just fine. And Jamie the MF, is still awesome. The way he negotiates.

1294,Spider-Man 2,How can Spider-Man possibly be Improved?,"Spider-Man 2 (2004, Dir. Sam Raimi) It's been two years since Peter Parker had his transformation into Spider-Man, and he is still trying to balance life perfectly. His love for Mary Jane is becoming much stronger, as he finds it hard to not let her down. His friendship with Harry Osborn is at risk, as the young Harry is frustrated with Spider-Man getting away with his fathers death. And if this wasn't enough for the superhero, a new enemy is in town. Dr. Otto Octavius is involved in a freak scientific accident, and emerges as the dangerous, 'Doc Ock'. The first 'Spider-Man' movie was amazing, and you would have to wonder how it could possibly be improved. Well, you just simply make a sequel. Good sequels which was better than the original are hard to come by, but 'Spider-Man 2' does the job perfectly. All the cast and crew return bringing a very familiar feeling to the original movie. Everyone is older and feel more mature. Alfred Molina is an actor who is not normally associated with comic book villains, but he performs an awesome version of Doc Ock, who is definitely more menacing than the previous Green Goblin. The special effects have improved this time, with some great action scenes between Spidey and Doc Ock. If you've never seen the 'Spider-Man' movies, what are you waiting for?

1295,Spider-Man 2,Spider-Man 2,"No one can deny that 2002's Spider-Man was excellent. It had everything that was required for a top superhero film  great characters, great script, great action and great effects. The story of the all-too-human Peter Parker who, because of a freak accident (aren't they all?!) became Spider-Man, and after the death of his uncle decides to heed his advice and fulfil his responsibility to protect people with his new-found powers. Of course, the Green Goblin showed up to mess things up, but it all worked out (reasonably) well in the end. To write a synopsis for the sequel, I could just settle for ""see above"". The story behind this film is pretty much the same as the original, but then again when the result is this good, a 'more of the same' attitude is not necessarily a bad thing. There are obviously going to be some changes, and this time Peter begins to lose his powers instead of gaining them. This gives a nice little twist to the story, and also provides most of the films lighter moments (Spider-Man taking the lift to get down from a building), and throughout this shows how comfortable director Sam Raimi is with his source material. Also fully present and correct is the good-hearted scientist who, because of an experiment gone wrong, becomes a mad bad-guy. However Alfred Molina must be given credit, as he is a much better villain than the Green Goblin was (and not a stupid mask in sight!), giving the right amount of menace to the film; he almost steals the show from right under Tobey Maguire's web. The rest of the cast are also excellent, their characters evolving just as you would expect them to after the first film. However, unfortunately it cannot be said that the sequel is actually better than the original; it is clearly its equal, even though has better acting, better effects and a better villain. The problem comes slap-bang in the middle of the film, just after Peter has decided to give up being Spider-Man and start his life afresh. The set up becomes repetitive  his powers fail him in exactly the same way (in mid-air) a total of four times. He even goes into a burning building just like last time to save a kid; though this time he is without his powers. Once he gives up his responsibilities, the film seems to dip into some kind of soap, with Peter trying to win Mary-Jane back. This results in some quite trite dialogue, and the whole act is far too long, prompting the audience to have doubts as to where this is all going. But it is all saved by a relentless final act, where Spider-Man realises he has to do what he does, and goes to kick some ass. And does he! The action scenes beat the originals' hands-down, and special mention must go to the showdown on the train, which is accelerating out of control. They are expertly shot and edited, giving any other film of 2004 a run for its money in the excitement stakes. It's non-stop pace is just what the film needs after the slow middle section, and it clearly shows that this franchise is definitely going somewhere great. If only that middle had a little more attention paid to it, then this could have quite possibly been a 10. However because of this, and it's 'more of the same' feel, no matter how good it might be, just puts the top score out of reach. Rated: 9/10 More reviews at: [URL]",9.0,jon2005,2006/05/22,11,8

I am sure I will never seen a movie that will be this much fun again! In fact, this movie alone has convinced me that Tarantino has to be the greatest movie maker of all time. This is my go to movie when I can't make up my mind what to watch; I am guaranteed satisfaction! The movie has no plot! It is a collection of out-of-sequence stories that make up the last few days of the life of a hit man, played by Travolta. That's it! He and his partner are simply taking care of an errand and it goes wrong, while he also has to take his boss's wife out for dinner to keep her entertained while he (the boss) goes out of town for the night. That, too, goes wrong. Every single thing in that movie just goes horribly wrong and it's just fabulous. The acting is compelling.

However, in this day and age i.e. nearly 2012, and my age, thirties - this film didn't really float my boat. Storyline weak, humour minimal and crass - OK the odd good part but very few and far between. Everything was far exaggerated and OTT. The reactions of his sister and the school teacher.

1300,Blackfish,Thought provoking and well made - even if it's biased,I would agree with some of the negative reviews that this film is biased and does misconstrue some of the facts in the Seaworld story. Seaworld does have a website to present counterarguments to the documentary. I looked at this website and although it points out some flaws in the film it did not change my mind about the films main message which is that keeping these large intelligent mammals in captivity is cruel and potentially dangerous. This film really does make you think twice before planning a trip to an aquarium or zoo and it inspired me to do some research into similar parks in Canada. Overall it is a compelling and enlightening documentary especially for those unfamiliar with this story.,8.0,libra67,2014/03/11,11,9

Their lives are interwoven by a series of events both tragic and hilarious. I really liked this movie. I had a tough time getting in to it, largely because, being American, the working-class Irish slang was hard to follow. But eventually you can find your groove, and then the movie starts to make sense and roll along nicely. It has a very good script (perhaps over-reliant on profanity), with fun and interesting characters. I love good ensemble movies, and this film has as strong an ensemble as any. It has plenty of humor, and even a few action scenes (hard to pull of in an independent movie). I give it an 8 out of 10. It only loses points with me because of the overuse of profanity; some unsteady camera work (a cliche who's time has come and gone); and some pacing problems in the first half.

1302,Hotel Transylvania,Adam Sandler a voice over genius,"The first thing you should ask yourself before seeing the film is, do you want to hear Adam Sandler's Dracula impression for an hour an a half. Second should i trust Adam Sandler to not put any penis jokes in a children's film, oh and you can't. Thirdly, is there another film playing the same time for the same duration you can watch while your kids watch this one. If not than this is just one of many sacrifices of being a parent. First of all while watching a bad movie you may not be aware of it till about 30 minutes in, exactly the same amount of time your refund expires. So now your here for the long haul, at this point I still have some hope but to pass the time I'll just pick out reasons why this movie sucks. I noticed most of the movie is just in a few rooms in a hotel, which means most of the money went to the actors or produces or Adam Sandler. You can tell an animated film is cheaply made when a table is cloned 100 times and used in the big action scene. The plot, well i guess it has one. Dracula doesn't want his daughter to grow so he convinces her the world and humans are terrifying and evil. That's it, no bad guy, no one to root for, everything about it was cheap. To fill in the boringness Adam and his pals make off colour jokes I'm guessing for my benefit. So little creativity was used when making this too, remember how Toy Story cleverly brought toys to like or shrek did with fairy tale characters. You would expect something smart with monsters but there is nothing. So if your kid tells you he likes it, remember that's not how kids say they like something.

1304,Spider-Man 2,Spiderman 2- A sequel that surpasses the original,"First of all let me just say that Spiderman 1 was good but not perfect. The only other sequel I preferred to the original was Superman 2. All the regulars return but this time the villain is Dr Octavious played by Alfred Molina. In my opinion however I thought Williem Dafoe was better as the villain. Everything was perfect, the scripting, the acting and the action sequences. For an superhero movie it is also quite emotional but that just adds to the appeal. There was also the hint of a revenge subplot between Harry Osborn and Spiderman. Spiderman 2 is the best in the franchise so far. I also went to see Spiderman 3 but to be honest I was slightly disappointed. That isn't enough to deter me from watching future sequels though. No.4 bring it on!!!",9.0,Ibuk,2007/10/29,9,7
1305,The Fault in Our Stars,Shailene Woodley is amazing,"Not as bad as I expected from the trailer, not as good as I had hoped after seeing the reviews. It's not all that great, but it's not bad either. It's shamelessly, even overly sentimental, totally unsubtle, but hey, it works somewhat most of the time. Probably the biggest reason for this is Shailene Woodley. I remember thinking she was really impressive in The Descendants, even in her limited screen time. Then I saw her in The Spectacular Now, and yes, I became a bigger fan. She's pretty amazing here, an actress completely capable of naturally selling the roles she plays, without making them ever feel artificial or contrived. I wish her a long, very successful career, and when it comes to certain things, she's better than the current it-girl Jennifer Lawrence. Ansel Elgort doesn't fare as well. He has some good scenes, but somehow he just comes across pretty unconvincing.",,Red_Identity,2014/08/18,11,6
1306,The Wailing,Best film i've seen this year so far,"This movie is a revelation, being a fan of Ha Hong-Jin's who had previously directed two of the best thrillers of recent memory (The Chaser and The Yellow Sea) i had great expectations for this but as I was watching I knew that this is going to be something else, it looks like an urban legend of some kind but I'm not sure, the exorcism scene in this made me jump from my seat. The movie takes place in a small village in south Korea, a policeman is investigating a series of murders but then more strange things start to happen, people losing their minds, Houses burning, suicides... and at the center of all this mystery is The Japenese Man ""the stranger"" and the mysterious Woman in White, I don't want to spoil the rest of the movie for you but it's really one of the most original and most Clever mystery/horror films ever made in my opinion especially in the midst of all the Hollywood recycled movies, rip offs and remakes that strangely make a sh!t load of money at the box office but films like this, ones that challenge viewers both mentally and emotionally, are completely ignored by movie goers, I'm sure Horror fans will consider this film a miracle and non Horror fans will enjoy it even more because I think it works really well as a Mystery/Thriller, the characters are well developed and you start to care for them especially the Protagonist and his daughter who deliver stunning performances and the cinematography is spot on.

1307,The Fault in Our Stars,Artificial movie for an idiotic generation...,"8.5 on IMDb?!??! Seriously?!?!?! You can rate this movie SO high... if you wanna be stimulated emotionally in a gratuitous manner + if your IQ level is REALLY low + if you like actors who can't act and look absolutely artificial on the screen (what the heck happened to Laura Dern? she used to be a slightly better actor... now she looks like she's joined the ranks of the completely artificialized Americans... fake smiles, fake emotions; those kids act completely unrealistic also... this is NOT how people who will die from cancer would behave...). Have someone on the BIG screen cry for a few minutes... the audience will cry too, of course. It's like the yawning that's contagious... But why was it that I didn't care at all for ANY of the characters, by the end of the movie?... The only moment that was a bit moving was when the girl received the news about his death... But even that wasn't connected emotionally to anything else in the movie... I can list a hundred movies that are WAY more emotional than this pile of artificial cr*p... And what the f**k is with that pack of cigarettes on the boy's coffin? I know cigarettes eventually PUT you in the coffin, but his was not the case...

1308,Blackfish,Captive Shamu: Blackfish In Review,"The purpose of this review is to give my input on the film and also my recommendation on whether or not to watch the film for my readers. The documentary Blackfish was an emotional and creative film that shows the consequences of keeping an intelligent and sentient animal in captivity. The documentary captivates its audience through emotional testimonies and interviews. Directed by Gabriela Cowperthwaite this film gives a voice to the inner activists in a part of all of us through the emotional tale of Tilikum, the 12,000 pound bull orca that has spent 31 years in captivity and currently resides at SeaWorld in Orlando, Florida. Interviewing former SeaWorld trainers and an OSHA expert witness, the film tells about the deaths caused by Tilikum and the possible causes that lead to this behavior. Captivating and heart-pounding, Blackfish gives its audience a first-hand account of what happens when you keep intelligent sentient animal in captivity. It also tells about the environments in which these whales are forced into while in captivity and how this environment negatively affects their health and behavior. Blackfish is a documentary packed with emotion and the style of a prosecution case file. I feel that the film accomplished their purpose and got their message across in a unique way. Though the documentary is a completely one-sided and bias film, I feel that it is very moving and greatly affects its audience---especially those that are animal lovers. I strongly agree with the points made in Blackfish and greatly enjoyed the evidence that the director used to help her case. However, I did find the random SeaWorld commercials a little annoying, and I felt like they didn't really belong and just interrupted the flow of the movie. The first-hand accounts provided by former SeaWorld trainers more than made up for this minor annoyance though. I found it very easy to form an attachment with the trainers and whales. I felt that the use of archived footage from prominent news stations was ingenious and provided a more realistic recount of the past accidents and tragedies. Blackfish felt genuine and down-to-earth to me, and it was easy for me to understand and relate to. I also liked how the film did not strictly conform to the genre and while it was not what I expected, I greatly enjoyed it. There was not much that I didn't like about the film and I can see myself watching it over and over again. In conclusion, Blackfish is an addictive, emotional roller coaster of a film that appeals to animal lovers everywhere. The director uses creative ideas to get her point across to the audience, giving the film a prosecution case vibe. The testimonial interviews from former SeaWorld trainers really brought the message home for me and made it so much more relatable for the audience. Using archived footage to back their claims was a unique and attention-grabbing device that kept me interested. I highly recommend this film for everyone and I can see myself watching it again in the future.",10.0,rachelk335,2015/03/16,3,3
1309,Blackfish,Great movie MUST SEE FOR ALL,"This is an excellent film for families, and everyone to watch. If you love Orcas/killer whales, PLEASE watch this movie. This movie has truly changed my life, I have made everyone in my family watch it, and plan to continue to share it with anyone who will listen. It is heart wrenching, breathtaking, horrifying, yet honest. It tells the truth behind how they were caught from the ocean, they were not rescued and taken to sea world, they were captured. They were ripped from their families and some were killed during the process. It also shares a lot of details about their lifespan, former trainers experiences, and more. This movie will make you cry, but also helps you appreciate the beauty and intelligence of killer whales. Please watch this film & share with everyone you know.",10.0,lachelleibarra,2013/10/25,21,17

What a preachy, transparently didactic and (yes, indeed) pedantic waste of time. This movie was like Magnolia, but done really, really unskillfully.

I would imagine that the number of people who rented the video or saw it on cable that stopped watching the movie because it was so bad is fairly high, especially for a movie that is considered a great movie. However, I concede that a number of people truly like it. However, I find that there are just as many people who are repulsed by this movie.

1312,Ferris Bueller's Day Off,Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986) - Bueller? Bueller? Bueller?,"The leader of the Brat Pack, the late John Hughes, comes back with another movie for all coming of age teenagers. ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" takes place on a popular high school student named Ferris Bueller who gets away with everything, when skipping nine days of high school, and his principal is on the loose to finally get him busted. The movie was perfectly funny, and there were some perfect moments with drama hiding behind it. John Hughes has made a movie teaching us to do what we want, be free, have a day off, and get away with it. That sounds like something you can steal from a teenager's diary. And the great cast including Matthew Broderick, Alan Ruck, Mia Sara, Jennifer Grey, Lyman Ward, Jeffrey Jones, Cindy Peckett, and Edie McClurg, were all hilariously brilliant. But besides Broderick, who made a great favorite of a performance, it was Alan Ruck who caught my attention as Cameron, and looking at the character, reminds me so much of how I am as a person. I sometimes can't handle things, and can't get my way out of anything, and that makes me a bit similar to this particular character. Now, who knew John Hughes can come up with an awesome coming-of-age teenage story of the 80s, and put it on film. The movie was funny, dramatic, and mostly a well-written diary of what every teenager wants to do for a living.

1313,Interstellar,why everybody is wrong and this is a really bad movie,"OK, this is a rant. For perspective: I love movies/see everything in the theater/can enjoy almost all movies/love scifi. But I hated Interstellar! This movie makes nooo sense. Technoscience babble on Star Trek knows is makes no sense, Interstellar tries to make you belief it has a scientific bases, it does not! It rapes hearsay on about a dozen theories, but it's like a five year old read Hawking and then explains it to a retarded dog! I'm not even gonna say spoilers ahead, because spoiling something inherently means ruining something good, no chance of that here! First of, apparently there was a world war, people many died... but somehow with a reduced world population there was still not enough food, so everybody had to become a farmer.... seriously? that alone is a crappy premise that makes no sense. Bcs it's not like they are doing it manually! They have frigging robot harvesters. Also, no MRI scanners, but apparently we still harvest fossil fuels to keep 50 year old trucks going. There is a plague that kills crops....but apparently not tress/grass/bushes/ and other assorted plant life, just the edible ones. A dust bowl you say.... really bad production when in the shot the window still is full of dust, the wall boards 10 cm next to it are clean.... Also, in the car: masks on, in an old wooden rickety house, take them off... Man shows up at secret NASA base...oh what a coincidence, you used to be a NASA pilot , we're your old buddies! By the way TOMORROW! we are launching our only rocket. You can pilot it bcs our crew has only done simulators where as you flew it...once....10 years ago.... WTF!?!? This crew and you will spend 10 years together on a mission, but we don't need to do a medical check, psych profile OR even refresh our memory, just show up tomorrow dude! We launch into space, OK we need to dock with the big ship, switch to manual...uhhm, why would you do that????? Well we've been in technological dark ages for 50 years, but hey look we did happen to invent cryostasis! how convenient! We're on a spaceship with limited room, but your cryochamber for some inexplicable reason has to go down into the floor , why? we'll it looks cool of course! At this point we're only like 45 minutes into the friggin thing! So I'll speed up: Planets orbit a black hole, or only one does? where is the sun that is providing light, why doesn't it get sucked in? It's not OK to have the ship experience 7 years time delay, but the shuttle is OK. Big wave smashes shuttle on rocks, no damage! You were gone for 23 year, I didn't think you were coming back, but instead of continuing the mission I decided to sit on my ass and watch the black hole. Frozen floating clouds. Homicidal Matt Damon. Robots that are absolutely ridiculous.... really really really ridiculous...like lost in space ORIGINAL TV did it better. Robots walk in way that is not possible, take 4 pieces of wood and find out for yourself. Nothing escapes a black hole, not even light, but we can send in the droid and it can send out a signal... Also, black hole does give of light apparently. Somehow girl's part is bad acting both as a kid as well as an adult. CONSISTENCY AT LAST! We don't have enough fuel to visit 2 planets, but now we do, so everything is OK. Many years time delay,wake up on space station. Go back to help new colony, also time delayed, don't worry bcs we didn't bother to send anybody else the the last 100 friggin years. BLLEERGGHHHHH",1.0,melkurion,2014/11/07,714,314
1314,Primal Fear,Shocking Film Brings Out Acting Talents Of All,"I'll always think of this movie as the one which introduced us to the acting talents of Edward Norton. In other words, this movie made him a star, as the cliché goes. But Richard Gere should be credited, too, with another fine acting performance. For quite awhile there, Gere acted in one good movie after another and I believe this was one of his best efforts. Sometimes his ""pretty boy"" image masked the fact that he has been a pretty darned good actor in a number of film. Not only is the acting superb in here - by everyone, not just Norton - but the story is very involving, too. I remember being riveted to the screen while seeing this in the theater. Some of the scenes are quite shocking, particularly when we discover the real ""Aaron Stampler"" (Norton). If you wait awhile (at least five years) and see it again, it's still shocking even if you vaguely remember a few things. The bad side of this - to me, not to most people, is the overuse of the Lord's name in vain in here (mostly by Gere, who is ridiculous in this role in that regard) and the obvious anti-Catholic bias in here. Once again on film, we discover that a priest turns out to not only be a sexual deviant but also the cause of Aaron's murderous mindset. I also didn't find Laura Linney's character, ""Janet Venable"" to be entertaining, just annoying. There's something about Linney's smug looks that really turn me off. I have found that unlikeable characteristic in some of her other films, as well. Overall, if language or Catholic-bashing doesn't bother you, this is a super film. Even if it does, it's a pretty intense crime movie and certainly entertaining.",9.0,ccthemovieman-1,2006/11/15,26,19
1315,Blackfish,Hearing a harsh critique of SeaWorld only seems right coming from the people it meant the most to.,"Without a doubt Blackfish is one of the most horrific theatre experiences you'll have this year. Director Gabriela Cowperthwaite presents a very carefully constructed case on the effects of inhumane treatment of Orcas in captivity. The one-sided argument is that the untimely human deaths caused by captive Orcas were not their fault but rather the fault of their captors; SeaWorld, and the evidence proving this point is so disturbing and so shockingly obvious that it's no wonder SeaWorld refused to be interviewed. The story centers on Tilikum, a 12,000 lbs. Orca that is directly responsible for the death of 3 people, including Dawn Brancheau the former senior trainer at SeaWorld in Orlando. The film explores the reasoning behind the likely ""psychosis"" Tilikum has experienced in captivity, and the disgusting cover up executives have tried to make. While SeaWorld naturally refused to be interviewed, the films perspective mostly derives from former trainers/employees of SeaWorld and other various experts. Their experience working with Orcas - most having dedicated their lives to it - is truly heart breaking. Presenting the theory, the evidence and finally a solution to the topic at hand, Blackfish is a marvellous story that will have you as tearful as the trainers that sincerely care for the well being of the creatures. Blackfish doesn't just show a bunch of disgruntled former employees bashing SeaWorld either. The greatest technique employed in this film is its use of footage from shows featuring these trainers when they were younger. There's something so mesmerizing about watching the smiling young trainers play with their best friend while hearing their older self reminisce in voice over. Hearing a harsh critique of SeaWorld only seems right coming from the people it meant the most to. While we've always known Orca's are intelligent creatures Cowperthwaite dedicates a lot of the film to demonstrating their capacity for emotions as well; watching them over time build connections with their trainers and each other. So by the time they show us their capture and captivity and witness the pain felt the whales, Tilikum especially, we know that their violent behavior is a direct result of SeaWorld. Killer Whales having never harmed a human in the wild. I want to go through every point made by the movie but I won't. You need to see this for yourselves. The facts aren't what drive this film, the emotion behind them do. This is one of those movies you just won't stop talking about, and for the subject matter that's the best compliment it can receive. In the end sharing this information is what's going to help these Orcas. Between the gripping footage and the distressing stories Blackfish effectively proves its point. There are very few movies like this; a must-see. There is no way after seeing this movie that you'll ever want to go to SeaWorld again, and for the sake of the animals that's the only thing we can do for them. Since it's made quite clear; the only thing affecting their decision-making is: how many Shamu dolls and tickets they've sold.

1316,Intermission,Average at best. By no means a classic.,"I'm Irish and I've been living in Denmark for a while so I was looking forward to going home last week so I could see Intermission. And I will go on record as saying: THIS FILM IS AWFUL. It is not quite as bad a something like ""The Most Fertile Man in Ireland"" but it definitely does not stand up there with other Irish films such as The Commitments, I Went Down or Michael Collins. Some aspects of the film are actually quite funny, such as Colm Meaneys American-style garda. But the film itself is shot completely wrong. The bouncing around of the camera and the constant zoom-in, zoom-out tries to give the film an edgy look as if it were a gritty drama. But it isn't. This is an Irish Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and it should be shot like this. It should have smooth movement from one shot to the next. The film just looks sloppy and thrown together. The performances are okay, given the awful script. A friend of mine said to me like it was like they just followed Colin Farrell around Dublin for a week. He gives a decent display as a Dublin Dirtbag, but it no way compares to his performances in Minority Report, Tigerland or Phone Booth. The best performance was from Dierdre O'Kane who plays a sexually frustrated middle-aged woman who has just been dumped by her bank manager husband for a younger woman. I think she should leave her god-awful stand-up and focus more on her acting. All in all, its does in no way live up to the expectations put on it by the Irish press or deserve to be even considered as one of the best Irish films ever. I'm expecting a backlash from these comments because most people I have spoken to have said it was great. But before you reply, ask yourself: Would think so highly of this movie if it was set in England or America?",2.0,jonathanfdaly,2003/10/21,33,17
1317,Crash,Deception,"Zero Stars (out of 4) By Aaron Dumont Among the countless slew and turgid veil of the garishly safe, self-satisfied PC-indulgence fests released within the past years, Crash, a monstrous, clunky culmination of the very, very worst of Altman-wannabes and the most tired and bored of overused conventions, stood among the most confoundingly successful of them all. In Paul Haggis' Crash, an array of characters live in Los Angeles. Their lives intersect with each other, and they go through an unbearably straightforward series of melodramatic incidents, mainly due to a car crash. The movie as a whole is executed in a pretend-mythical style—astoundingly overused, absurdly glossy spiritual symbols, artificial, indulgent melodramatics instead of genuine humanity and insight. The characters are portrayed as either victimized angels or bigoted demons that repent to become victimized angels. The movie itself is so clean, manufactured and mass-produced that it feels like a plastic shell. The characters are nothing more than pop abstractions that begin with little-to-none dimension and, paradoxically, lose dimension as they progress. The social and cultural tidbits portrayed here are illustrated in straight, bold, plain lines. Crash's formality feels so out-of-place, so uncomfortable, that even with any redeeming values, it's impossible to forgive. Now, technically speaking, it's not the worst movie ever made, and it's not the worst of the decade, either. In fact, based on technical guidelines, it's not even the worst movie of 2005. However, in applying the Joe Queenan theory-—that the truly worst movies ever made are the ones that shot for the moon and offshooted; the movies that bugged you; the ones that stuck with you for a long, long time - Crash is really the worst of its year. It is also one of the worst of the decade (only The Village, The Passion of the Christ, Hancock and a few others fare worse). It's wildly visionary approach simply felt like a mammoth-scale failure. It got to me. It bugged me. The whimper this movie got out of such a fruitful idea was simply sad to watch. Any faint merits or respectable attempts for greatness made it seem all the more heartbreakingly terrible—this pretentious, cheap disaster seems so wasted. The movie is a deformed pastiche of political blindness, soullessness and emptiness. It appeared to me as a lifeless, rushed scam - a movie that feeds off mass consensus of opinion without trying anything revolutionary itself. Crash is a movie that gives itself the undeserved assertion that it really is revolutionary-—yet it pathetically follows the crowd while it obnoxiously assumes it is leading. This movie could have been so much more—something modest, something in-touch, something relevant--or, at the very least, something tolerable.",1.0,dumontaaron55-1,2009/08/19,22,15
1318,Blackfish,Free Tilly! Blackfish is a pretty good movie.,"Directed by Gabriela Cowperthwaite, Blackfish focus on the history of Orcas AKA Killer Whales in captivity such as SeaWorld and the back-stage drama interacting with human trainers in entertaining water works stunt shows. The film does make a good persuasive case against keeping these creatures in captivity for the purposes of human entertainment by highlighting many incidents of human trainers getting killed, or attack during these shows over the years. It's seem to happen to other marine life parks in the past as well, as the movie shows with examples such as Sealand of the Pacific in Canada and Loro Parque in Spain. I wish they talk about the attacks on Miami Seaquarium and Marineland. They also show how badly this marine parks are run. Marineland at Canada was one of the worst, as a large number of whale die due to bad treatments of the animals. That park should had been talk in the film. I don't think the documentary is all against having animals in captivity as animal rights activists think the film is showing. In my opinion, the producers is against Seaworld treating these creatures as if a circus act. The movie does paint SeaWorld into a negative light. I really doubt that SeaWorld only care about profit, but I do agree they do need to be reform. SeaWorld does serve a purpose for the public in educating them, and do scientific research about Marine life and do treat their whales better than other marine parks. The film fails to reference that they do help rehabilitating some animals back into the wild, while also keeping the animals that might not be able to survive in the wild, alive. A good example of this is Miracle, a sick, starved orphan whale found in 1977 that found a new life in SeaWorld parks. Plus, not all the whales are used in shows, at all. Most are kept there. I'm not against having animals in zoos, but I don't think this film is one bit saying 'free all the whales'. About the dangers, the trainers knows damn well, that their jobs might be dangerous and they are willing to take all the risk. I do have to agree, that certain whale with aggression shouldn't be in water works shows at all. SeaWorld has a long history of ignoring this. I wish the documentary would talk more about the attacks of Kandu V, Hugo, Orky II, and Kasatka. It would show that many marine parks ignored the safety of their trainers, by having them deal with dangerous whales not only SeaWorld. Even the great Shamu had an accident with a human, but it wasn't mention in the film, just the film footage was shown. The film mostly focus on the history of one Orca, named Tilikum whom been involved in the deaths of three individuals in the past who been bully by other whales, and abuse by his handlers. The film argues that the reasons why the whale tend to more dangerous in captivity, than in the wild is because how the creatures are raise. Whales in captivity tend to live be more stressful because of the training, harassed by fellow captive whales that isn't family to them, left in dark tanks for hours, and the lack of large free range pools. I think the film could had discussion this, with better examples such as the history of Lolita and Kshamenk. Both whales has suffer much due to these reasons. I have to agree with most of the film statements. As of this writing, no killer whale in the wild has cause a human life. What the film falls to mention is that the wild whale that interact with humans are mostly 'resident' whales that tend to live in areas with large fishing areas. They are used to human contract. They tend to be less violent than 'transient' killer whales that tend to travel large distances and mostly live in the open ocean where human contract is less likely. I also didn't like how the movie point that the John Sillick accident was due to whale aggression. John Sillick accident wasn't cause by the whales wanting to hurt him. Another trainer miscue the act, and signal the whale to breach. It was clearly the trainer's fault, not whale aggression there. Some facts in the film are indeed inaccurate and misleading. Was the film exploiting a tragedy? Somewhat, but the issues of whale captivity has been in question, long before Dawn Brancheau's death in 2010 in such films like 2008's Lolita- slave to entertainment. Overall: the interview with former trainer was informative, but they do admit that they are not qualified to understand the traumatized psychosis of these creatures. The film forget to discussion, that the reason why whale die in captivity younger than in the wild is due to diseases, not psychology breakdowns. Still, it's hard to get a clear understanding what go through these creatures mind during a show. The showcase of history of capture of baby whale getting separate from their mother was heart-breaking. I do think that SeaWorld should not take captive-born babies or help promote whale kidnapping in Iceland. The use of attack film footage was well done and intense and not use in bad taste. Still, not worth seeing this movie with little children unless age-appropriate. The film does feel a bit cloyingly attached to appeal to our emotions to side with the whales. I think it made the film more interesting. Yes, it was a bit one-sided journalism documentary, but I came out learning more than I came into the film. I like how it was aired on CNN for free. In my opinion, killer whale are wild animal just like any other. Killer being the keyword. They are not pure evil like 1977's Orca or kid friendly like 1966's Namu or 1993's Free Willy. They can still harm you, like any animal. So be caution if dealing with them.",8.0,ironhorse_iv,2013/11/19,10,8

The three original Three Stooges would have been cringing at this pile of poo. Even the American Pie series came across as positively 'Shakesperean'.

1322,Ferris Bueller's Day Off,"Not just a classic of the 80s, but of any decade","Matthew Broderick looked so brilliant in those days. While this film single handedly made him Ferris Bueller forever, at least this is a film that can be seen all throughout the years without dating too badly. Sure, the music and props will signify a time of discontent and bad hairdos, but the idealistic look of a man simply wanting to ditch school has never been made more daringly and charmingly. Everything about this film was gold, from the postmodern ""conversations"" with the audience to the little back stories which seem to shape the overall canvas of the film. While Alan Ruck was way too old to play in this movie, at least he proved to be a great opposite to the cool and nonchalant Ferris. Gross-out comedies may now be the norm, at least we can look back to this film and enjoy a good, genuine laugh.",8.0,Agent10,2003/04/09,211,162
1323,Moon,Great SF,"In a year so many weak and disappointing movies, this is a gem. It not only stands out among movies released in 2009, it stands out among science fiction movies in general. And let's make sure we're on the same page with the term ""science fiction."" Lord of the Rings is not science fiction! It's fantasy. Why people would confuse that I have no idea. Star Wars is a gray line. Space Opera (which is how Star Wars is defined) is fantasy in the guise of science fiction, because it's not about scientific concepts, it just uses motifs borrowed from science fiction in a fantasy context. Fantasy is all about magic and the impossible, science fiction (that is hard science fiction) is all about what is possible or may be possible within the realm of science as we currently understand it. Moon is science fiction, and it's a rarity. It's very simply a story about a guy up on the moon by himself. Which on paper looks like it would be very boring. But it's not. Actor Sam Rockwell carries the entire film by himself and does an amazing job at building a very suspenseful plot. This is a limited release, so you have to hunt it down, but it's worth it.",8.0,CSHaviland,2009/08/01,9,5
1324,The Wailing,"There Is No Ask, Only Feel","I kept having to pause this which I don't recommend as a way of watching this film; it's almost entirely based on the total buy-in of mind, body and soul into the atmosphere and action presented within. Losing that ride through the world, having to re-enter it and engage mentally again creates a disconnect and a discordance. The plot is either nonsensical beyond belief or so stupidly straight- forward considering its running time that that's the only reasonable explanation. I don't know. I do know that the seance/exorcism scene is incredible and hypnotic, even as you realize you don't understand what it is the shaman is doing; not that you're meant to in this case, but it's an apt metaphor for the whole film.",7.0,spencergrande6,2016/12/14,12,4
1325,Blackfish,"Blackfish is a documentary that is worth watching due to the home videos, interviews, and information it provides.","Blackfish, directed by Gabriela Cowperthwaite, is an interesting, thrilling documentary. This movie is thought provoking and made me walk away wanting a better life for the whales that live in captivity. It was more than I expected it to be and not only told the story of Tilikum, but also showed everything that was wrong with SeaWorld. After watching this movie I will never take my family to SeaWorld. Due to the popularity of the movie, SeaWorld has lost revenue and artists have canceled playing at their annual concert. The movie was a success because the director used real footage to tell the story and is extremely informative in the facts. To begin with, Blackfish (Cowperthwaite 2013) was a successful movie because real life footage was used and former whale trainers were interviewed. This proved the movie's validity and also made the viewer more connected to the storyline because they could give a real face to the character that the story was about. The New York Times talked about the movie by saying, ""Seemingly supported by chilling video and the oral testimonies of two witnesses to Tilikum's first attack in 1991, the trainers accuse SeaWorld of cover-ups and misinformation."" The scenes of Dawn playing with Tilikum and loving her job made me emotionally tied to the movie and made me feel even worse about her death because she now seemed like someone I knew. However, the whole movie is not only real home video footage, there are also interviews and slight bits of animation. These provide a perfect balance for the viewer so that a story can still be followed. Shots from when a trainer was crushed by a killer whale were shown and although they may be gruesome, they are getting the point across that the whales can and do kill trainers. ""Through the rueful voices of former trainers and whale experts, a narrative driven by disillusion and regret unfolds as the trainers point to a gap between SeaWorld's public image and behind-the-scenes reality""(New York Times). There is no other person a viewer would trust more than a former trainer to tell them the facts about how wrong SeaWorld is for treating these animals so badly. This is why the interviews during the movie are incredibly powerful. The interviews of how wrong SeaWorld is are then backed up by scenes of tour guides lying to the guest of the amusement park about facts about the whales lives. Watching the scenes and listening to what the former trainers said made me feel bad for the animals and made me want to do something to help the whales at SeaWorld after I walked away from the movie. Secondly, I would recommend Blackfish (Cowperthwaite 2013) because it is extremely informative. Through the movie I learned many facts not only about killer whales, but also about how SeaWorld runs its business. Chris Sawin, a critic on IMDb.com, says, "" While 'Blackfish' is extremely informative it also reveals a little too much at times."" Although some of the facts and scenes such as watching Tilikum's sperm get extracted by trainers can be a little to graphic, to me, it is part of the movie and it is better to tell all the facts in order for the viewer to get the full picture. This was an important scene to the movie because it was explaining how Tilikum's sperm is very valuable due to his size and ability to perform. Through Blackfish (Cowperthwaite 2013) I also learned about the process in which SeaWorld goes about capturing the whales and separating them from their families, which they are closely connected to because of an extra region in their brains that focuses on emotional connections. The movie was informative and taught me about the whale's lives while living in captivity. In conclusion, Blackfish (Cowperthwaite 2013) was a well-made movie that provided the viewer with an extreme amount of information and also used video footage along with interviews of former SeaWorld whale trainers. The information was helpful because it gave me a better background of the whales. It also showed the correct facts about whales and how SeaWorld whales are suffering due to living in captivity. The video footage showed proof of how the whales attacked trainers and made me believe what the movie was trying to prove. By using interviews of former trainers I formed a sense of trust that what they were saying was completely true because they had experienced it first hand. I would recommend this movie to everyone that enjoys documentaries.",9.0,bray4-929-498080,2014/02/20,12,10
1326,Hotel Transylvania,Chix Chat on Film Review: Monstermania.,"Hotel Transylvania comes across in the trailer as a monster good time where Count Dracula (Adam Sandler) hosts all the legendary monsters at his hotel to celebrate his daughter's birthday while he works overtime to keep his daughter from falling for a human, who haphazardly stumbles upon the hotel. The story was interesting in how humans were viewed from the point of view of the monsters, as not just the enemy but as fearsome. I couldn't really figure out why Johnny (Andy Samberg) would be out hiking alone in Transylvania, I couldn't figure out why Mavis (Selena Gomez) wouldn't just bat out and see Haweewee or the world for that matter, and I couldn't figure out why Drac's bat was only slightly sun sensitive. There was some fun to be had watching this film and it was clear how when anyone ages, their idea of fun is totally different from that of young hundred and eighteen year olds. I did notice from the laughter in the theater that children don't really get it with some of the humor it just has to be physical, and I know that the children didn't understand the underlying story of an overprotective father. But, with the very spirited young wolves, the green smoke joke and all the colorful creatures, this was a good film for tweens. There was an interesting moment when Johnny was asked if he believed that humans, all humans were ready to accept monsters, but the reality is even with films like Twilight romanticizing a relationship with a vampire, it doesn't change the fact that if a being came out of the coffin who lives off of human blood, survival instincts on both sides would kick in and someone would have to go! I was fond of Ceelo's mummy and found Steve Buscemi's wolf to be as believable as any father with a massive brood, exhausted! Fran Drescher's Eunice was so Real Housewives of New Jersey and Luenell's Shrunken Head cracked me up. I have to agree with Johnny that Dracula's accent and behavior was over the top. It was kind of creepy when he would fang out, yet this was a charming little story that was entertaining and fun even if Mavis did borrow from Puss in Boots when she wanted her way. It will garner an audience that will appreciate it for what it is, an hour and a half of movie viewing escapism. I give it an amber light.",6.0,EmmaDinkins,2012/09/28,13,5
1327,Blackfish,Heartbreaking. A change is needed!,"Absolutely heartbreaking. Ever since watching ""Free Willy"" back in the 90's, I've known about the problems with keeping killer whales in captivity. I've followed the stories of accidents, injuries and deaths. I'm torn, however, between wanting to never have another whale put on display, and knowing how much we've learned precisely because of places like Sea World. I'm hoping there's some sort of solution to this. Maybe places like Sea World could find a way to allow these whales a MUCH larger space to roam while they're not performing; a more natural habitat like that mentioned at the end of this documentary. Also, the practices need to be changed, like ripping the young away from their mother ... that needs to stop immediately! No matter what, something needs to change. These animals are beautiful, intelligent creatures, and we can learn a lot from them.",8.0,BlackRoseShelli,2014/01/28,11,9
1328,Hotel Transylvania,So much wasted potential...,"This was among the animated movies I was most disappointed with after watching (I would rate it between the stinker ""Cars"" and the mediocre ""ParaNorman""), and even more so due to the wasted potential. The setting had everything necessary for a great comedy, they even had very funny moments (the lame ""party"" organized by Dracula, including the slowest game of Bingo I have ever seen, the mayhem caused by the werewolf cubs, Wayne's sleeplessness and of course Winnie the werewolf toddler's sniffing talents - in fact most of the good scenes involved the werewolves), but all was ruined to me by the totally out-of-place music, the unlikeable deadhead ""hero"" Johnny, the stomach-turning family drama (overprotective father, teenage daughter, argh!) and of course by that ""bleh, bleh, bleh"" running ""gag"". What this movie does have - in it's favour - is a cutesy heroine (even in her bat form), some likable sidekicks (the mummy and Frankenstein's monster, e.g.), lots and lots of monsters (most of whom did not get enough screen time) and a snide joke on the ""Twilight"" movies.",6.0,guenther-10,2013/05/12,4,3
1329,Moon,Classic sci-fi driven by a Sam Rockwell tour-de-force,"I attended a screening of ""Moon"" at the 2009 SXSW Film Festival in the legendary Paramount Theatre. There wasn't an empty seat in the 1300-capacity palace. Directed by Duncan Jones, ""Moon"" stars Sam Rockwell, one of our generation's most powerful actors. The notion of a film being unique seems unlikely in 2009. Not here. While ""Moon"" is a modern-day science fiction film set in the future, it pays homage to recent classics like ""Blade Runner"" and ""Alien."" Viewers will be dazzled -- fans of the genre will nod in approval. Science has developed a way to mine the rocks of the moon for clean energy here on earth. Private enterprise, in the form of a corporation, sends astronauts on a three-year work stint to carry out this ongoing mission. Sam Bell (Rockwell) is the latest to undertake this task, with the trusted robot GERTY by his side watching over the base's operations -- think HAL with a heart. Of course, things are not what they seem, and the viewer is mesmerized as puzzling and surprising events unfold. Cinematographer Gary Shaw contributes to the impression of the eerie stillness of life on the moon with the copious use of still camera and slow tracking shots, only using hand-held when necessary. Nicolas Gaster's editing is sure and steady, emphasizing the slow pace of Sam Bell's multi-year work assignment. Remember those pre-CGI days when special effects meant miniature land rovers on a bumpy table? It can still be done -- and be believable. ""Moon"" is evocative of the sci-fi greats whose visuals were done in-camera, i.e., on set as opposed to being created by computers in post-production. Sam Bell's unearthly home is comfortable yet aging like the patina of an old cottage. Nathan Parker's screenplay (Jones wrote the story but handed over screen writing duties to Parker) makes the most of Sam Rockwell's considerable talents. This was quite a physically demanding role, as well, and rarely has the actor been better (watch ""Snow Angels,"" though). He doesn't just carry the film -- ""Moon"" is almost a one-man show and Rockwell conducts a master class. ""Moon"" is a classic, down and dirty (literally) science fiction film with a baffling mystery that challenges the viewer to live in the shoes of the protagonist. It's hard to imagine a better one than Sam Rockwell or a more effective, entertaining, and satisfying cinematic experience.",10.0,larry-411,2009/03/25,606,491
1330,The Fault in Our Stars,Un-Good,"Betrayed by the Top Critics Score, yet again. The Rotten Tomatoes percentage hovered in the mid-eighties a day after theatrical release. As the ticket taker scanned my phone, a nearby police officer demanded I toss my recently purchased coffee in the garbage. I replied instinctively. ""Yes sir."" My shoulders fell as I dropped the cup, lid still stoppered, into the pit of complete and utter waste. Throughout The Fault in Our Stars, a choir of hapless sirens relinquishes groan after moan, highlighting each character's obvious emotions, and inflating the tortuous plod of lack-luster plot. Anderson Cowan, cohost of the best podcast ever, The Film Vault, said it best when describing, 'the crowd of early-teen females cooing and goo-gooing,' at every emotional turn. A girl was bawling, crying like an infant in the back of the theater after Gus died. I've never been in a movie where someone subjects everyone else to their weeping. And hey, more often than not, I've got leaky ducts. But I sure as hell don't thrust it on others. And I've never been uncontrollably sobbing. Most assuredly I'd make a hasty retreat out the theater. Okay, enough personal anecdotes. I'll complain about the actual movie now. This film isn't made for me. Perhaps people who like the book can't help but enjoy the on-screen adaptation. At best, though, educated filmgoers can only qualify it as a 'guilty pleasure.' The Fault in Our Stars is not a good movie. I should have known better than to trust a poster title scrawled in a chalkboard font. The use of handwritten script in the lettering of the title has become a staple of the 'Dromantic Quirkedy.' (A dramatic romantic quirky comedy.) In fact, any theatrical release poster utilizing 'the creative quirky penman theme' with handwritten fonts, doodling on spiral notebook stock, or blackboard sketching is generally a red flag. I haven't read it, but I didn't appreciate The Fault in Our Stars. It's not okay or mild; it's a poor film. And here's why. The acting is not great on Ansel Elgort's part. His character, Gus, is overly theatrical; breaking into grandiose soliloquys which are meant to be cute and uplifting. Gus is a bit too romantic; his optimism too paper-thin. His haughty bravado is never convincing, and ultimately serves to detach the viewer. Thereby oftentimes reminding the audience they're watching a motion picture. Nat Wolff, who plays Isaac, is clearly meant to be 'the funny guy.' Of approximately thirty attempts at humor, his jokes hit home twice for the briefest of chuckles. A lot of the black humor, such as the jokes about Isaac losing his sight, are just not funny. My God, some of the moments that get the audience roaring with laughter, are actually very tragic and harsh. Just because something is played for laughs, doesn't make it funny. When Isaac's feeling up his sexy girlfriend in the parking lot, the timing's so stilted; it's disorienting even discerning what's intended to be funny. Jokes are measured by the quality of the humor, not by the purity of a writer's intent. Willem Dafoe's character is somewhat compelling, and I enjoy his off-type performance most. The confusing scene in Anne Frank's house is contrived and cheesy nonsense. Firstly, it feels (in a misleading manner) like something surreal's happening. The two American tourists start sawing face in the attic hideaway, and the surrounding European strangers respond with applause? It's absurd. And silly. Not uplifting. Laura Dern, as Frannie (Hazel's mother), is a bit of a shmoop. Dern's usually tough to swallow. Her performances consistently include an odd tic; an overly ambitious facial expression or touches of melodrama (I'm thinking specifically of Blue Velvet). But in TFIOS, she's just overly soapy. All the mother-daughter bonding moments are painful. And when she shows up wearing the towel, does anybody believe for a second that Frannie had just leapt out the tub? All I can see is Laura Dern pretending to don a towel. Shailene Woodley is good, as always. She's best in a very good film, The Spectacular Now, and is one of the redeeming elements of Alexander Payne's dreary snore, The Descendants. The film leans on the supposition a viewer will feel unquestionable sympathy for Hazel. To be frank, she's quite off-putting and not necessarily likable. As far as the story goes, it's dull and depressing. I marched out the theater feeling unfulfilled, confused and defeated. The policeman watched as I sauntered out the exit, brandishing his nightstick and releasing a satisfied chuckle. But I'm too wrapped in thought to recognize his villainous ways. The question I keep asking myself: What's the rub? My sister read the book, so I asked her. ""What's at stake? What am I supposed to take away from this story?"" ""I thought it was nice they got to spend the one night together before he died."" So there's the selling point: The takeaway is the experience of becoming absorbed and swooning in the romantic notion of romance. I find zero experiential value in this narrative, since the merit of an unfunny 'Romantic Comedy' supposedly resides in the 'feeling of romance.' Most men are the same way. It's not a redeeming quality. We don't derive satisfaction from the swooning sensation. This is why most 'date movies' are bad. But anybody older than twenty (without nostalgia for the book) will realize this is a sub par film. Ladies. Please don't drag your significant other to this movie. Go see Edge of Tomorrow, 22 Jump Street, Maleficent or How to Train Your Dragon 2 instead. Way more laughs (and feel-good moments) in all four.",4.0,stephenlovelette,2014/06/18,49,23
1331,Blackfish,The Horrid Treatment of Sea Animals Leads to Human Tragedy,"Dawn Brancheau was not only one of the most experienced trainers at SeaWorld in Orlando, Florida, she was one of the most beloved. According to her colleagues in the documentary ""Black Fish"", she understood sea animals, particularly killer whales, like few others. For 15 years, she trained killer whales and participated in the killer whale shows at Seaworld, working with one of the most famous and largest killer whales in captivity, Tilikum, a bull orca. At only 39 years old, her career was cut short. (It should be noted that whales are not fish; they are air-breathing mammals who live in the water; their ancestors once lived on land.) In 2010, shortly after a show which became a disaster when Tilikum failed to cooperate because of mishaps neither entirely the trainer's nor the whale's fault, Dawn decided to have some quiet time with Tilikum to calm the whale down and ease their relationship. After only a few minutes, Tilikum grabbed Dawn, pulled her down into the water and mutilated her. Because scientists now know whales are highly intelligent, similar to their dolphin kindred, more than likely this whale knew exactly what he was doing: he purposefully killed his trainer. Tilikum's behavior may have been carefully considered as a message to his human captors that he was frustrated with the circumstances of his captivity. This is the focal story of ""Black Fish"", a scathing exposÃ© of these entertainment parks, especially in regards to their killer whale shows. Like most kids who grew up in the late 1970's, 1980's and 1990's, I went to SeaWorld a handful of times. Seeing these beautiful creatures in front of your eyes is a magnificent wonder to behold, and in particular the killer whale shows. Most Generation X'ers and Millennials visited SeaWorld and similar amusement parks themed around sea animals. I think we all assumed the whales and the parks had a special relationship in which the animals agreed to be in captivity in exchange for food and shelter. I think I also assumed these parks were created by people who loved sea animals and wanted to create these attractions as a way for the public to interact with these incredibly unique animals. While the trainers and others who are in direct contact with these animals certain love and respect them, corporate interests appear to have very little empathy or sympathy for the animals they own, more interested in profit than humanity. ""Black Fish"" paints a very grim picture of the attitudes of upper management of SeaWorld and other similar parks in the United States and around the world. Although not mentioned in the documentary, SeaWorld Entertainment was originally created by the Anheuser-Busch corporation as part of their Busch Gardens amusement parks which were associated with their brewing companies. While certainly the idea of an amusement park founded for the purposes of exposing the public to sea animals, the parks were created by a beer company, not by animal lovers or experts. Early on the documentary, we see footage from the 1970's of whales being captured for the purposes of eventually becoming part of SeaWorld and related amusement parks. Since there was no regulation at the time, hunters could capture these animals at will without fear of government oversight. The documentary traces incidents of disruptive and violent behavior among the animals which appears to be a direct result of mistreatment. The documentary portrays corporate managements of these parks as having little regard for these animals, and the most at stake in terms of generating large revenue and pleasing stockholders. They would give young trainers misinformation about whales to minimize their responsibility towards the animals. Often in many of the accounts of injury and even death among trainers, the ""official"" story from the corporation was the incidents were the fault of the trainers, and the animals are generally happy and content, and bad things happen because of error. However, the documentary reveals much mistreatment of the animals, to the extent that sometimes the animals will hurt one another, which happened early on to Tilikum when he was young. The story-line also reveals that when these parks became hugely popular in the 1970's and on-wards, there was little scientific research about whales and similarly high-intelligent sea animals. For many years, it was thought that whales were not highly emotional, and they lived for only about 25 to 30 years. Apparently, much of the data came from whales in captivity, not whales in the wild. It was eventually revealed that whales in captivity tend to live shorter lives, and in the wild, among those who reach adulthood, whales can live about the same life span as humans, from 60 to 75 years. They are not only highly intelligent, but they bond emotionally to members of their families in similar ways as human beings. However, these were unknown to the SeaWorld corporations who seemed to have little interest in understanding the nature of these animals. A sobering look at a cultural phenomenon which became part of modern life in the late 20th century. Sea parks, an outgrowth of the larger complex amusement parks begun by Walt Disney in the 1950's, have become part of American and international culture. Unfortunately, they were established to make money, and they would mislead young trainers with erroneous information. According to the documentary, much of the conclusions of upper management had nothing to do with knowledge about whales. While I am sure upper management individuals would deny any wrong-doing, they are pressured from stockholders and corporate executives to minimize their responsibility. Here, the documentary relies on the testimony of the trainers and not a corporate spokesperson.",9.0,classicalsteve,2016/05/15,5,5

1333,The Fault in Our Stars,Movie was okay...crowd was ANNOYING.,"From what I saw and heard of this movie it was okay. The acting was good, the story somber, but alright, but the distracting crowd ruined any chance I had of developing feelings for the characters or story. Although I ended up having a great time at the movie, it had to do with my reaction to the crowd and not the film. And now, my experience at opening night of the movie The Fault In Our Stars.... I had read some about it, that it was a popular book, and that the movie was going to be sad, but good. Man....was I ever in for a surprise. So I took my male cousin Robin(both of us in our early 30's), telling him that it was a tear jerker, but that I had heard good things. We arrived to a PACKED theatre. Packed with teenage girls. We found 2 seats finally in the middle of a row. Before the movie started the theatre people gave an announcement that after the film there would be a Q&A with the writer and the 2 lead actors via satellite. The crowd of girls screamed and cheered. Then when the films opening credits started, more screams. We both looked at each other and said ""what the heck did we get ourselves into?"" Then once the lead male came on the screen, it was like we were transported to the 60's at a Beatles concert. Seriously, the girl beside my cousin was actually biting down on her sweater, shaking and squealing. Then every 30 seconds we had to hear ""a[URL] for every cute look or nice thing the boy said to the female lead. Really, we were annoyed because we felt like we couldn't enjoy the film. Then....................SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! When we learn one of the leads is going to die....the whole theatre started crying...collectively blubbering in unison. Then for the remainder of the film the cries turned to heavy sobbing. Girls clutching tissue boxes and their whole bodies convulsing in lamented moans. And my cousin and I just couldn't keep ourselves together. I felt him choking back laughter and then I was choking back laughter and then we just burst out in gut wrenching laughter. WE JUST COULD NOT STOP LAUGHING! We tried to make our laugher sound like sobs. People must have thought we were loosing our heads with sadness. But we couldn't help it, it was just TOO FUNNY. We got the heck outta there once the credits rolled. Looking like most of the movie goers...all teary eyed and puffy faces, but our tears were from laughter. I HAVE NEVER LAUGHED SO MUCH AT WHILE WATCHING A SAD MOVIE IN MY LIFE. I think if u want to bypass the annoying teenage girls, wait till it comes out on DVD.

1336,Spider-Man 2,Basically the perfect superhero movie.,"Comic book movies don't get much better than this. Sam Raimi once again proves what a great director he is with this sequel to the fantastic Spider-Man movie of 2002. And as good as the first movie was, this one improves on it in many ways. It's a fantastic continuation from the first one, fitting right into the storyline. I honestly don't think anyone could hope for a sequel better than this. Set two years after the first movie, Peter is struggling to find balance between his two identities. His life is falling apart. His loved ones are still suffering from various events from the first movie. And now a new enemy has appeared. What can become of all this? The storyline of the movie is really great. It sort of makes you ask yourself questions. Like how long can a person really put other people before themselves before it all just becomes too much? Can a person really handle that much responsibility? The movie definitely gets the human side of the story right, and has a strong sense of emotion about it. It doesn't just go through the motions and have Peter as a hero who never gives a second thought. He is portrayed as a normal person who got these powers that he never asked for. After watching the movie you might re-think ""How awesome it would be to have superpowers."" And the villainous Doctor Octopus has been given a drastically different origin in the movie to the one he had in the comics, which was a risky move to make, but it really worked. The acting is great, once again. Tobey Macguire still does a great job as Peter Parker and Spider-Man, Kirsten Dunst is a good Mary Jane Wattson and James Franco plays Harry Osborne well. As with the first movie all the supporting actors in the movie are great, like JK Simmons and Rosemary Harris. A lot of the chemistry the characters had with each other in the first movie is back, although considerably different in contrast to the differences that the events of the first movie have caused in their relationships with each other. The actors pull off the changes well. Alfred Molina was the perfect casting choice as the villainous Doc Ock, and played the part fantastically. Couldn't have asked for a better actor for the job. The visual effects in the movie are amazing. The effects in the first movie were decent, but these are a vast improvement. The action scenes were just amazing and really got my blood pumping. All of it just came together better than someone could hope for. Once again the costume designs were fantastic, with huge props for the way Dock Ock is done. His artificial arms are awesome and the character could not look more perfect. So all in all, the whole movie was fantastic, and It makes me sad that I missed the chance to see it at the cinema.

I think I might have liked it a little better if Roger (Payola) Ebert had not called it the Best Picture of the Year. There is no question that CRASH had a few good moments but those can't compensate for the utter nonsense that contaminates this Grand Canyon-Magnolia rip off. First of all--I live in L.A. I find it hard to believe that writer/director Paul Haggis has ever been here. THere are race problems but it's not the only thing we think about 24/7. How convenient that all of Haggis' unconvincing characters do. I can't remember so many repulsive people in one film. The silly drunk wife who emasculates her husband because he didn't take a bullet to defend her honor when Matt Dillon fondles her was such a contrived nauseating character. What did she expect her husband to do? She didn't love the guy so their subsequent kiss & makeup was nauseating too. And Sandra Bullock needs to let her pathetic, shrinking career just slither away. Don't try drama sweetie. You stink. As for the blanks in the gun and the subsequent events. Give me a break!!!! The persian man shot a child in the back and he's home spouting gibberish about how his angel saved him. The SAINTLY locksmith had every reason to kill that man on the spot. But like MILLION DOLLAR BABY (another Haggis disaster), there are no consequences for people's criminal activity. Clint pulls the plug on Hillary and there's no investigation. He's free to open a diner while Morgan Freeman drones on with his insipid narration. Hillary is clocked in the head by a criminal act but no one gets in any trouble. But back to CRAP, I mean CRASH. How did Paul Haggis pitch this garbage? ""Let's make a movie about L.A. and its isolated population where everyone talks about race problems in a preachy unrealistic manner to each other and at each other. And everyone that appears to be a bad guy, will do something good. And everyone that appears to be a good guy will do something bad except the Hispanic locksmith--he's a virtual SAINT who just stares out the window. I could go on about the nonsense when the cops pull over the film director who is at the end of his rope because of the aforementioned fondling and a Tony Danza confrontation. Haggis knows nothing about the LAPD. That guy was a threatening menace and he would have likely been shot on the spot. And the idea that the other guy is hiding in the passenger seat with his gun is beyond laughable. Our cops would never let anyone leave like that without at least looking in the car--for their own safety. I don't have time to list the other hundred things that are wrong with this film.",1.0,ivantt,2006/01/24,39,24
1338,Interstellar,What a massive disappointment,"Though I am not a Bat-person, and do not wish to become one, I have admired Christopher Nolan for his early films and 'Inception', though, with the exception of 'Insomnia', I always regarded them as, in the immortal words of Andrew Sarris 'less than meets the eye'. I do not like to call films pretentious, but with 'Memento' and 'Inception' the word certainly came to mind. They seemed shallow pretending to be deep. The same is, in my opinion, certainly true of 'Interstellar'. Yes, it carries you along for a ride, and yes the special effects are great, and yes, it might give us pause to think what will, in fact, be the destiny of our species. But, my dear Mr Nolan, surely you must realise that our species will not survive by planting American flags on distant planets. And, like 'Gravity' before it, the search for a happy ending has totally destroyed any shred of credibility of what might have gone before. The image of Cooper floating around Saturn without his spaceship, waiting to be picked up by a passing probe (just before his oxygen runs out, of course) is so ridiculous that if Stanley Kubrick were to be told that it is a respectful reference to the 'starchild' at the end of '2001', he'd punch you in the nose. 'Interstellar' - for all of its attempts to incorporate relativistic time dilation and very clever (I do not use that word in a derogatory sense) visual representation of multi-dimensional string theory towards the end, is void of any real cultural insight. The film simply extends 'The Wizard of Oz' into the space age and decides at the end that there is really somewhere better than home. It is TOSH! Great films tell us something memorable about the human condition, or the nature of cinema itself. This film, for all its quotes from Dylan Thomas does neither. It is for people who think that the word 'awesome' has some profound meaning and not, as is the case, an excuse for not finding a more appropriate and restrained reaction. Any suggestion that it deserves a Best Picture Oscar is a sad comment on the way that those awards have become debased in recent years.",6.0,Balthazar-5,2014/11/13,312,142
1339,Intermission,Good Movie,"Generally I steer clear of hoemgrown movies - however, this one was quite good. It wasn't ""typically Dublin"" or ""typically Irish"", which was good. It was just a good movie which happened to be set in Dublin. The story lines were good and well thought out and intertwine nicely. There a few nice twists in it too and it wasn't too heavy. Movies are supposed to be entertaining which this was. There was also no cringe moments, which is unusual for a homgrown. The only other homegrown I saw which was world class was Michael Collins.

There are some similarities to this and Superman II. If you have seen both, then you should know what I am talking about. If you liked the first one, then you will love this. A great second Part. I highly recommend this film. I love all 3 films. I loved this film. One of the best superhero films out there. If you are a DVD collector(Like me) then you should add this to your collection.

1341,Primal Fear,enjoyable,"Primal Fear is one of those movies you are likely to enjoy. I enjoyed it, it was a pleasant watching experience. It's a well-done, semi-intelligent thriller with a phenomenal performance by Norton (whose performances continue to fascinate). Still, it's not a great movie. In fact, it's one of those ""Hm. I've seen Primal Fear, jolly good then"" movies. Why? Well, it's generally by the book, with an ending that is easily foreseeable and unfortunately pokes a ton of holes in the story. Still, watching it once (and probably only once, or maybe a second time but that's it) you'll be entertained by it. It gets the mind going a bit more than the usual drivel the commercial machine spews out and it doesn't bore. It also attempts to pose some questions about the nature of justice (almost as if it feels it has to have an agenda) and consequently has to answer them, and does so in a very simplistic, awkwardly forced way. Nonetheless, it's an enjoyable watching experience.",7.0,canadude,2004/03/18,2,2
1342,Detachment,Desperation and Despondency as a Wakeup Call,"I had no idea how ill prepared I was to experience ""Detachment."" Here is a film that plunges headfirst into the depths of disillusionment, despair, and failure and almost never resurfaces for air. You will experience emotions normally repressed during movie watching. You will be saddened, shocked, and above all, angered. You will see things you wouldn't ever want to see and hear things that should never be heard. You will wade through a sea of bleakness, desperately searching for some small shred of hope to cling on to. At the end of it all, you will be so psychologically drained that, for a time, it may seem as if you will never be happy again. At the same time, you will also get to thinking, and that's exactly why I'm recommending this movie so highly. A few months ago, I snubbed my nose at the critically acclaimed thriller ""The Grey,"" an equally hopeless and depressing but also nihilistic story about men who must fight against wolves, and themselves, in the snowy Alaskan wilderness. Unlike that film, which reduced its compelling ideas into a cheap and shallow thriller, ""Detachment"" uses its desperation and despondency to make a point. I don't see it as a movie so much as a wakeup call, a way for audiences to understand not just the world but themselves as well. At its essence, it's an examination of behaviors that are perpetuated by people that have the power to stop it. It might not seem like they have the power. In fact, it might seem like absolutely everything is working against them. There's no question that rising above adversity is a challenge. Nevertheless, it's one that must be faced. The main setting is an inner city public high school, one that exemplifies with horrifying detail the failure of the No Child Left Behind act of 2001. Most of the students are poorly educated, violent, and foulmouthed. They have no respect for others, but more to the point, they have no respect for themselves. They have, in fact, degenerated into pure apathy. This has rubbed off on the faculty, for they know that all their years of teaching and guidance haven't made the slightest difference. They're constantly berated by furious parents for being so lousy at their jobs. It's almost as if they have relinquished themselves of the responsibility of actually raising their own children. Is your son or daughter a problem? Don't take the necessary steps of working towards a solution – simply dump them off at school and let the teachers do the dirty work. Bearing witness to all of this is a substitute teacher Henry Barthes (Adrien Brody). He struggles to make a difference, all the while knowing that he's failing miserably. He sees nothing but people who have given up, and he's within of inch of giving up on himself. His personal life is a mess; his grandfather (Louis Zorich), in the advances states of some kind of dementia, languishes in a nursing home staffed by people who simply don't care. He has flashbacks of a childhood scarred by the absence of a father, an alcoholic mother, and a deep tragedy. He eventually takes in an underage prostitute named Erica (Sami Gayle). He's saddened by her situation and even helps her in a few important regards, but he doesn't coddle her like a frightened puppy. He wants to get through to her that she has value as a person, that she's so much better than giving oral sex to men on the bus. He's also tortured by the fact that their arrangement can't last forever. Several distinguished actors make appearances in this film, mostly as faculty members. These would include Marcia Gay Harden, Tim Blake Nelson, James Caan, Lucy Liu, Blythe Danner, Christina Hendricks, Isiah Whitlock, Jr., Bryan Cranston, and William Petersen. All are in various stages of professional and personal breakdown; Nelson plays a teacher who isn't noticed by anyone, Caan plays an administrator who can only get through the day on medication and biting wit, and Harden plays a woman who knows that the end is near. In one of the best scenes, Liu lashes out at a student for her disrespect and indifference at her own future. She gets nothing but kids like this day in and day out. What is the point of pointing out their academic shortcomings when they obviously won't take the steps to better themselves? Of all the actors that appeared in the film, the most compelling is Betty Kaye as a student named Meredith, who observes the school through the lens of her camera. She creates dark collages with her photos. Her creativity is labeled by her unseen but clearly heard father as unnecessary teen angst. Believing only beautiful people are worthy of attention, he cruelly harps on her about her overeating, the way she dresses, and her social isolation. Meredith, an intelligent young woman, makes a connection with Barthes. Unfortunately, her self-esteem is so low that she misinterprets his encouragement as personal affection. The film intercuts linear scenes with multiple narrative techniques, none more resonant than Barthes' documentary-style confessionals. The final scene begins with him reading the opening sentences from Edgar Allan Poe's ""The Fall of the House of Usher,"" which should already tell you everything you need to know. The message of ""Detachment"" is simply one of responsibility and caring. If you're a parent, nurture your children and allow them to be themselves. Don't expect a school system to raise them for you – as they say, education begins at home. Before you point out someone else's flaws, first recognize your own. Understand that you're not perfect. Be thoughtful of others. And above all, know that you matter. There is no tragedy deeper than giving up on yourself. -- Chris Pandolfi ([URL]",9.0,Chris_Pandolfi,2012/03/23,19,18
1343,Crash,Possibly the most cliché and contrived movie I have seen yet.,"Crash was about as forced as they get. The producers apparently thought that the use of a racist slur every 30 seconds for 2 hours would somehow be ""enlightening"". The only thing I found enlightening about this film was the fact that it won an Oscar for best picture. It made me aware just how self-absorbed Hollywood really is; gee a movie about LA that won best picture, go figure! Very predictable, very contrived and very far-fetched, it was like being spoon-fed every stereotype that exists. For those of you out there with an IQ greater than your age, put this one at the bottom of your Netflix que. Having said that, there are a few good one-liners in the movie and of course lots celebs. In my opinion, those are the movie's only redeeming qualities.",1.0,jeffrplant,2006/03/07,82,46
1344,Taxi Driver,Superb,"I just watched Taxi Driver (1976) De Niro is Travis Brickle a lonely man with little social skills, who lives alone in New York. He works nights as he is struggling to sleep, possibly due to PSTD from the war to some other incident we do not know about, we never find out, we only know his military history. When he is amongst his fellow taxi drivers he has a child like shyness (He never speaks unless he is spoken to, and often zones out of conversation) that eventually begins to give way to anger. We see everything from Travis's point of view, he hates the city and the scum in it, we get lots of tracking shots of the city, the vile people in the streets and of a lonely De Niro slowly walking through the streets alone and constantly writing in his journal. After stalking/following a crush Betsy (Cybil Sheppard) he starts to have a relationship with the lady (these are the only times in the movie, where he seems remotely happy), only for him to react badly when he is rejected. He becomes further upset with his failure to help a 12 year old prostitute Iris (Jodie Foster) under attack from her pimp (Harvey Kietel) At some point he stops taking his medication and with guns he obtained through a co worker (He first uses a gun in self defence during an armed robbery in a convenience store) he starts planning something, but we are not sure what. All we know is he writes he will be dead by the time Iris reads his letter. After having a radical make over and then becoming violent including murdering 3 men, he is perceived as a hero by the public, even though he did not do it to be a hero, and does not think of himself as such. It's a slow burn and seriously depressing movie, it stays with you long after you have watched it.

1345,Detachment,1,"Detachment. A uniquely stylized film that people, ranging from teenagers to adults, should be able to grasp at varying levels of understanding. Those who watch will understand and sympathize with the wide range of characters that the movie portrays, based on their own experiences and age. Teenagers dealing with the angst of growing up in a world that they cannot possibly control, can sympathize with the majority of the students of this school, displayed in varying and unique circumstances. Further we come across the point of view of those that are older and are searching for deeper meaning in what life has to offer them, or anybody, which exemplifies the generation of those out of schooling and not yet old enough for achieved wisdom. Furthermore down the line of age and maturity comes the darker beliefs of the elder generation. Stuck in time, when they really appreciated what they did and what they stood for (the golden age) and now seeing what and where they are today. It gives them a dismal view of our future, a future where society will implode if our youth continues on the trend that has been set. But in the end. The final message of this emotional story is that of a positive idea breaking out of a negative mentality. That maybe there is hope. Even if it lies in a singular story you've helped alter in a positive direction, despite your mistrials and failures.",8.0,ssaimeri,2014/05/20,4,3

1348,Pulp Fiction,Meaningless genius.,"I think the genius of pulp fiction comes in its ability to take multiple unique stories and weave them together perfectly through unconventional means. It can be argued that the chapters of the film work independently, but when put in an ensemble, each one gives us a peak into a world that feels lived in and larger than what we're presented with, at the same time, Pulp Fiction still changes the audiences perspective of the world it takes place in with each subsequent chapter while still feeling like the world we were introduced to in the very first scene. The chapters are famously unchronological and I believe it's a testament to Quentin Tarantino's creative genius and skills as a writer that a lot of its potency and impact as a film can be accredited to its unconventional sequence. Its a film about perspective, at least that's what I took from it, and I appreciate how the only real ""point"" or ""message"" it has is precisely that anyone can come to a conclusion about it, much like the theories revolving around the contents of the briefcase that pushes the plot forward in the first place.",9.0,enriquelr-50976,2020/08/08,4,4

The other facts contributing to the facts that everyone seems to love this movie is absolutely mind-boggling. First off, the film has absolutley no plot. It's a bunch of stuff that happens. The scenes have no meaning and are very boring. Second, Jodie Foster is credited right after Rob DeNiro. She appears in the movie for about 4 minutes total (literally). Third, the ""extreme graphic violence"" in the movie is nothing more than a little bit of ketchup and water in the last 5 minutes from a few bullets. And last, the score really, really sucks. Admit it, it does. When I first heard about Taxi Driver, I was very excited. From all the reviews that said ""It was the most realistic film ever made"" or some such thing. Then I saw it and realized it was one of the most unrealistic films ever made, as well as awful.

1351,Crash,Hollywood preacheth and the sermon is deranged.,"This movie was literally crying ""gimme some Oscars!"". Hence, alternative titles could be ""Gimme Some Oscars For Our Blatant Unashamed In-Your-Face Preachy Political Correctness And Overblown Sentimentality"", or maybe even better: ""2 Days Of Absurd Coincidences In The Valley"". Phillipe, Danza, Bullock, Fraser. Wow! What a cast! Bullock has never been in a good movie so this fact alone spells trouble. Alone that scene with Dillon ""molesting"" the black director's wife guaranteed this silly movie an Oscar for Best Picture. By the way, that black couple DID engage in reckless driving because the woman gave him a blow-job while he was driving, so the LEAST Dillon could have done is annoy the slut a with a bit of cop-a-feel (no pun intended). Regardless of race, this should be done to ANY slut who gives a guy fellatio while driving. The fact that Dillon happens to be a racist – as ALL cops seem to be in Hollywood movies – changes nothing. Talk about a coincidence plot-device of the DECADE, when Dillon saves the same black woman THE NEXT DAY (no, not a month later, THE NEXT DAY). And as if one such plot-device wasn't enough, we get ANOTHER coincidence not much later, when the black director – yes, the woman's husband – has an encounter with the OTHER cop from the night before, Phillipe. Phillipe is the ""good white cop"". And it is in this scene that we have the dumbest moment in the movie: the director goes berserk when the two car-thief blacks attack him – and then PREACHES to the taller one about being ""an embarrassment"" to him (i.e. the black race) and LETS HIM GO, but not before HANDING HIM HIS GUN BACK!!!!!!! Those two car-thieves. What ridiculous characterization! The way they suddenly assault Fraser/Bullock is something out of a ZAZ comedy. It's as if this scene got accidentally edited into the wrong movie. The two lack credibility. They philosophize like Travolta and Jackson in ""Pulp Fiction"" - except that this is supposed to be a ""deep"" drama, so it comes off all wrong. First the taller one is paranoid about racism, the shorter one making fun of that, and then – inexplicably – they SWITCH PERSONALITIES: the shorter one defends rap music and makes fun of country being racist, while the taller one criticizes hip-hop for being primitive. Ludicrous? Yes: ludicrous. Aside from that, how many young black criminals who look like hip-hop actually CRITICIZE hip-hop?? This is silly and unrealistic. I half-enjoyed what was said about the rap ""culture"", but it came out of the WRONG CHARACTER's mouth. Or is it supposed to be funny and ironic that Ludicrous is saying it? Ha-ha. Hilarious... We have plenty of other nonsense/coincidences that just keep piling up. The way the Persian store-keeper shoots/misses the locksmith's daughter was straight out of the ""Cheap And Overused Plot-Devices Throughout The Ages"" handbook. And then we had the U.S. flag waving in the background as the Persian guy looks helplessly into the distance. It's obvious that the director completed the ""Cheap Movie-Critic-Pleasing Symbolism 101"" movie course. Oh, and Fraser playing a D.A.: not as absurd as Denise Richards playing a scientist, but thereabouts. Hollywood simply cannot let it go. They HAVE to keep trying and trying to ""solve"" racism in America. But how can a bunch of uneducated, uninformed hypocrites tell us anything intelligent on this subject? You want a lesson in racism? Watch an episode of ""South Park"". Or, if you want some hard, sobering facts, check out Richard Lynn's controversial studies on the subject. The fact that he is despised both by bleeding-heart liberals and the extreme Right should be a recommendation in itself. The positive sides are that the film isn't boring and I enjoyed the ""rap is crap"" dialog. Also, there is at least a hint that blacks can be just as bigoted as anyone else, which shows that even Hollywood can occasionally wake up and smell the roses. The soundtrack is good – it was just placed in the wrong movie. It evokes scenes from ""The Lord Of The Rings"" trilogy, i.e. doesn't fit with L.A. or racism or any of that. If you enjoyed other crappy Oscar movies, there is no reason you shouldn't enjoy yet more Oscar-winning nonsense. But do keep in mind: 5,000 MORONS vote for them every year.

1352,Hotel Transylvania,Monster Mash is a Graveyard Smash,"Hotel Transylvania was surprising good. Adam Sandler plays Dracula, the over bearing father trying to protect his adventurous world traveler dreamer daughter Mavis (Selena Gomez) from anything human, while at the same time tries to keep his hotel business running. Adam Sandler's role as the father figure, is a great new look into the actor's skills unchecked since Punch Drunk Love and Click, it's nice to see him playing something else than an annoying stupid voices, immature characters in movies aimed at teens and men who never grew up. I just glad he didn't play the ""nails scraping on a blackboard"" cringe-inducing way man-child. He is put to the test to try to protect his daughter Mavis when an young free-spirit, bag pack hostel, human named Jonathan (Andy Sanberg) walks into the hotel. In fear of losing his hotel business due to the presence of a human being, he has to figure out a way to quickly get him away. Dracula is force to dress up Jonathan as a monster, so he can freely able to get rid of him without his guest knowing. Before Dracula can get rid of him, his daughter and his guests find Jonathan as the life of the party, and very friendly to the point, that Mavis starts to have feelings for him. Jonathan and Mavis sub-plot relationship isn't as remotely as cheesy as Twilight. The movie even has a scene taking a jab at the Twilight movie in it. The movie is a lot of fun. There is a few sprinkling of potty humor, but it's doesn't detracts from an otherwise fun ride. Full of interesting-to-look-at characters and zany, hectic animation, it's a feast for the eyes with enough jokes thrown in for the parents in the audience, especially in Sandberg's character. The guest of the hotel made out of Frankenstein (Kevin James), Wayne the Wolfman (Steve Buscemi), Griffin the Invisible Man (David Spade) and Murray the Mummy (Ceelo Green) are play their roles great and gives something new to each of the old school monsters. The film is directed by Genndy Tartakovsky well known for his work for Dexter's Laboratory, Powerpuff Girls, and Samurai Jack. The computer animation is Pixar level. From all the animation monster-related movies put out in 2012, this one was worth the money paying. So check in to ""Hotel Transylvania"" to find Adam Sandler and his pals playing the greatest monsters in movie history.",8.0,ironhorse_iv,2012/11/01,11,8

It is not many movies that can say about themselves that they achieved that goal. And while Adrian Brody has made some weird acting choices of late, this movie suits him very well. It will be overlooked (it actually already has been overlooked), but it is a movie that dares to be different. A movie that takes its title literally and goes the whole nine yards with it. But it's not only the Brody show. Everyone involved in this (even the kid actors) are really good. It's funny, touching and dramatic sometimes in mere seconds apart. I don't think the movie will leave you without an impression. Even if it's the impression that you don't like it/the way it handled things.

1355,Goodfellas,Trash. Utter trash.,"Goodfellas makes a strong case for itself as the most overrated movie of the 80s or any decade. Never in my life have I encountered a film less deserving of its critical and popular accolades. After watching it for the second time recently (to make sure my impression from a viewing years earlier was accurate), I feel every person involved in the picture, and particularly Martin Scorsese, deserves to be punished severely for inflicting Goodfellas upon me. Goodfellas has absolutely nothing to offer. It has neither the wisdom nor the compassion to say or reveal anything about life or human beings. Anyway, Goodfellas is not interested in that. It just wants to be smart, hip, and funny. With such lofty goals, it's a wonder this entire star-studded cast of actors and filmmakers fell so very, very short. Goodfellas is not smart. It is not intelligent enough to understand what it think it portrays on an individual or larger basis. It does not somehow explain or explore the mob psyche, the existence of organized crime in America, or anything else for that matter. Despite the fact that it is taken from actual events and people, it seems to desire no contact with reality. Goodfellas is not hip. Apparently Martin Scorsese was not aware that there is nothing less cool than trying hard to be cool. Goodfellas is full of flashy camera moves, tough looking guys in swank suits, and more fast, colloquial dialogue than you could beat out of Dashiell Hammett, but none of it adds up to anything but slime. Yes, that's right: slime. Goodfellas is so obnoxious you want to take a magical eraser and scrub each of its characters back into the pure white on the page from which they sprang. Is this an honorable aim for a film? To make you hate its characters, to make you hate its voice? Let me be the one to say that cynicism is generally a good cover for laziness, and as an approach to life it is one step above nihilism. Real cynicism has no place in art. Goodfellas is not funny. A complete lack of respect for human life is not a secret recipe for brilliant ironic comedy. It is disgusting, really, and those who laugh reserve a spot for themselves in the grime between the cracks under the bottom of the barrel of good humor. The performances in Goodfellas, much lauded, are ridiculously one-sided. How wonderful they managed to span the chasm between looking tough and looking smug - all except for Ray Liotta who has to do the balancing act between being paranoid and annoyed. Bravo. Of note is Scorsese's choice to play pop music over 95 percent of the film, presumably so that we have something to listen to while we are busy ignoring his movie. Goodfellas is trash. Utter trash. The only thing I took out of it is that it is unwise to let a gangster stand behind you.",1.0,mr_tambourine_man72,2004/08/09,449,166
1356,Crash,What a giant crock of dookie.,"Pretentious. Ithink this would be the best word to describe this film. Blatantly contrived racial situations that at least from an acting point of view lacked substance, and depth. If all one has to do is use the word ""nigger"" or ""beaner"", or ""chink"" to evoke an emotion in film, do we applaud the reality of their social commentary? Or do we shelve those vulgarities with all other offences, and chalk it all up to a bunch of hacks, exploiting the human condition to make a film that could not be more derisive, or more insincere. I loathed this movie for its lack of understanding, and its generic case for race relations in our country. And the fact that this movie has won at least two Oscars makes my stomach turn. Munichwas ten times the film crash was. It is incomprehensible to me that such a piece of trash would take one of the most prestigious honors in America.

1357,Detachment,The meaning of life : detachment,"First of all, you want to know if this movie was enjoyable and watchable movie . In whole, we see the efforts of a substitute teacher to try to manipulate the manners of unethical kids . I don't know if the situation that is shown in this movie responds to the reality but if it does then it goes without saying ''God bless America''. Because this lifestyle is starting to adopted in my country, Greece . Kids must not only assault the teacher but also offend him. Mr Barthes is very decisive and knows how to react in these situations. Adrion Brody acts like he was being a teacher for several years. As it mentioned before , we see the efforts of Mr Barthes trying to help and at the same time teach his classroom. So he helps a raped slut that is very young and takes him to his house in order to take her after. Mr Barthes is firstly an altruist and not a conservative teacher who doesn't care about his class. Furthermore he helps Meredith who is a victim of offensive language from their students because of her beauty. Suddenly we see the difficult job of a teacher. These two, Meredith and the whore are sticking in Mr Barthes life without worrying about the future but only for the present. ''What should I do later?'', ''Is Mr Barthes keep me in her house forever?'' , ''I believe that Mr Barthes loves me''. These are the thoughts of frustrated personalities that they don't have anyone in their life to encourage them . All they need is some moral support and someone just to listen them. Nowdays everyone is very stressed and they don't spend time with their children. For many they don't even care about their future . They are just ''mouths to need to be fed''. I see the prejudices and the doublethink'' To be nice I must be thin''.'' To attract girls I must be working out'' ( I don't know that girls thinking sorry ) . Is this what is called sense of life? Of course not. The sense of life is determined by the choices you do. If you do the right choices you will be happy , if not you will be sad. And that is expressing clearly on the dialogue of Dr Doris Parker with one student whose dream is to play in a band after graduating and doesn't even care about school . The resolution to this is that teachers and only teacher considering that the most parents don't really care must lead students ''seize the day''. The fact that they are school is itself remarkable considering that in another countries they don't have teachers . An uneducated person ,these days , is a thing that is being used from everyone . And the worst is that he cant really react to the mistreatment who is living because when he had the chance to learn things he reacted to his teachers when the teachers , the good teachers, are the only one that they care about the future of the new generations.",8.0,dimitriscisse,2016/04/08,2,2

1359,Hotel Transylvania,"The ""Groovie Ghoulies"" On Speed – You Don't Just Watch ""Hotel Transylvania"", You Ride It!","In case you weren't a Saturday-morning cartoon show freak during the '70s, the ""Groovie Ghoulies"" was a Hal Sutherland/Filmation animated production featuring nice, family friendly versions of Dracula, the Frankenstein Monster, and the Wolfman (Drac, Frankie, and Wolfie respectively) plus a few other legendary monsters. The cartoons spotlighted their wacky, episodic adventures in a castle called Horrible Hall and also in the ""real"" world – or at least the world of Archie, Veronica, Betty, Reggie, and Jughead. They also did ""Laugh-In"" jokes and skits. Hotel Transylvania"" (hereafter ""H-Trans"") borrows a fair amount of that 60ish, freestyle ""Groovie Ghoulies"" vibe (plus the vibes of movies like ""The Croods"", ""Monsters vs. Aliens"", and even the Harry Potter series, and of course TV series like ""The Addams Family"" and ""The Munsters""). But that's good, because ""H-Trans"" uses its borrowings skillfully to spin out a wildly enjoyable, supersonic story about an extended nuclear monster family. The main theme revolves around widower Count Dracula's (Adam Sandler ) frantic efforts to safeguard his only child, surprisingly fetching and independent-willed vampire daughter named Mavis (Selena Gomez) from the ignorant terrors of the human world. Having reached the age of monster maturity (118, or 18 in human years), Mavis is eager to explore the mysterious world beyond the creepy, eerie walls of Dracula's castle. However, Dracula goes to extravagant lengths, even fabricating a Balkan village populated by the undead pretending to be hostile humans, to keep Mavis safe at home. Beyond that, Dracula has renovated his castle to be a hotel/retreat/refuge for all sorts of kooky, ""domesticated"" monsters, from good-natured husband Frank (Kevin James) and his nagging wife Eunice (Fran Drescher), to harried wolfman Wayne (Steve Buscemi) and his pregnant wife Wanda (Molly Shannon) and their unruly canine brood, to the narcissistic, bespectacled Invisible Man (David Spade), to obese but hip and swaggering mummy Murray (CeeLo Green), plus practically every other monster in creation. To keep the meddling humans out, Dracula has converted the hotel/castle into a seemingly impenetrable, booby-trapped fortress. Nevertheless, a back-packing surfer dude type named Jonathan (Andy Samburg) stumbles into the castle and is somewhat terrified by but far more curious about the place and its odd denizens. Aghast, Dracula tries EVERYTHING he can to either hide the human Jonathan from his suspicious guests, especially Mavis, or to disguise him as Frank's ""right-hand"" cousin ""Johnnystein"", who is also a ""party planner"". Of course, this fails and Jonathan and Mavis meet and find a ""zing"" of love and affection exists between them, so much so that in a calm, sweet break from the action, they climb to the hotel roof and Jonathan shows Mavis her first sunrise from beneath the shade of a chimney, since of course vampires and sunlight are not friends. Eventually even the obstinate Count and his guests realize that Jonathan is a pretty decent, trustworthy fellow, especially for a human, and knows how to liven up a bunch of cool, party-hearty but somewhat out-of-touch, antiquated monsters. Dracula even confesses to Jonathan in an emotional sequence how a bunch of torch-and-pitchfork villagers killed his wife and embittered him against humanity. Jonathan and Mavis get closer and even kiss (which bugs Dracula so much his face turns red and his fangs grow, which always cracked me up) and may even start on a path of wedded independence. But chef Quasimodo (Jon Lovitz), instead of his expected gentle personality, reveals a nasty but funny desire to serve Jonathan for dinner. Naturally, this drives Jonathan away from the castle. Formerly biased and cautious Dracula (and company) must now brave the outside human world AND daylight to intercept Jonathan's airplane flight from Transylvania and convince him to return. Can he do it, and reunite him with Mavis? As I said, ""H-Trans"" is a supersonic, roller-coaster delight of a ""monster"" movie that will almost give you a whiplash. Despite the pace, however, the movie is a clever, respectful homage AND parody of famous monsters (even the ""Twilight"" vampires) which also obtains its laughs from common domestic themes such as parent-child interactions, the search for autonomy and freedom, the need to let someone you love go and find his/her destiny, and the unexpected power of forgiveness. ""H-Trans"" also displays its humor through sharp dialogue and one-liners, slapstick pratfalls, and juvenile humor. In other words, just about anyone, from ADD patients to reasonably sophisticated cinema lovers, can find something to like about ""H-Trans"". These characters, monster and human, lead interesting lives, and deserve a sequel!",10.0,japamo,2014/06/14,1,1
1360,Primal Fear,So disappointing,"The way this movie ended was very disappointing. Before the end, I had thought that the movie had some flaws but they wouldn't matter because the end would be spectacular. I actually thought I had figured it out. Yes Aaron/Roy has a dissociative identity disorder. Two people live in the same body but when one comes out the other blacks out. Aaron couldn't remember anything when Roy was around. BUT, he could remember seeing someone in the bishop's house. Aaron would have no reason to lie and even if Roy had come out and killed the bishop, Aaron had seen a person before (otherwise he could not remember it). So there actually was a third person and that would turn out to be the real killer. That would be a twist ending right? But you know what? Aaron was just playing with us and for some reason Vail didn't realize the memory contradiction until the end. And when he learns the truth he just walks out. Wow, that's our hero! Furthermore, Roy seemed to remember talking to Aaron while Aaron didn't even know who Roy was. How is that possible? And is it really so easy to fool a psychiatrist? All it takes is to be a good actor? And what about the case with 60 million? It seemed an important thing, but after all it had no effect at all. This movie had numerous flaws. The only good thing was Edward Norton, the only reason I don't regret seeing the movie. He was spectacular. Apart from that, just a bad movie.",4.0,theocharous_an,2015/12/10,10,7
1361,Primal Fear,Nortons debut role!,This is Edward Nortons first movie and his debut role. As his first movie he did absolutely incredible. Ed Norton is just such an amazing actor. He was brought into this movie with the expectations of being nothing spectacular but he blew all those exspectations away with this bang up performance. This is about a young man (Norton) who is accused of murdering a bishop of a church. This is one of the most important cases happening so big city lawyer (Gere) offers to take up the young mans defense probono. As the two talk they become friends but the lawyer is in for a surprise from this quiet southern boy. This movie is absolutely incredible. It has a great story line and fantastic acting. Usually im not a big fan of Richard Geres but he did great here. I find it funny how Richard Gere didn't want Norton in this movie because of his lack of acting experience but i feel Norton stole the show away from Gere with his phenomnal acting. This is a great movie. It does not have much action it is more of a crime coutroom kind of movie. So therefore it may not be for everyone. Though if you are a hardcore movie lover who doesn't need explosions to make a movie and want a solid story and great acting then this is for you.,9.0,deatman9,2011/08/12,2,2
1362,Pulp Fiction,'And you will know my name is the lord!! When I lay my vengeance upon thee....',"An absolute classic in every sense and a must see for anyone even vaguely interested in films! A non-linear narrative following various characters including two hitmen Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield (John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson) a mob boss Marcellus Wallace and his wife Mia (Ving Rhames and Uma Thurman) and a boxer named Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis). They all have stories that are seemingly unrelated but come together subtly through their lives intertwining. It's masterful cinematic story telling, holding buckets of style while also making time to explore its characters and delve into their personalities underneath the crime plot lines. The dialogue is insanely good and the lyrical flow of it keeps you enthralled throughout. I remember when I was a young kid fascinated by the grown up world of Tarantino's films. My fantastic mother let me watch all of his catalogue apart from this one until I was older (due to the distressing gimp rape scene) and there was so much built up for when I became of age to finally watch this masterpiece. It certainly didn't disappoint and it was my favourite QT picture to date. It's rightly become a huge staple in pop culture while also maintaining serious rewatchability and classic status.

1363,The Chorus,Caged birds sing,"There's an air of romance surrounding wayward boys, particularly in the French tradition, where they tend to be poetic as well as mischievous. In ""The Chorus,"" Christophe Barratier draws on this tradition and adds some lovely vocal sounds. ""The Chorus"" is about an ""internat"" or reform school where a new principal who writes music tames his young charges, some naughty, some just abandoned, by teaching them to sing in a boys' chorus. The school director, Rachin (sounds like Nurse Ratched), François Berléand (of Jacquot's ""The School of Flesh""), is a prissy sadist who preaches a philosophy of instant punishment for all real or imagined wrongdoing (""action-reaction""); but when the new principal, Clément Mathieu (Gérard Jugnot) shows up with a soft approach to his classes and his supervisory duties, he finds allies among the faculty and staff. ""The Chorus"" advances the frequently screened theory that delinquent kids are better charmed than chastened; that if you can find a positive activity they excel in, the misbehavior will die out. Barratier has had good success with his young actors. The most important boy is the ""tête d'ange"" (head of an angel), tall, fair-haired Morhange (Jean-Baptiste Maunier), who's often in trouble and refuses to join the choir, till Mathieu catches him singing by himself and discovers his star soloist. Morhange's voice possesses not only a rich natural musicality but the haunting purity only boy sopranos have. Morhange has the most attractive mother, and Mathieu's success in encouraging the boy's singing makes the pudgy, bald man fantasize romance with her -- thus incidentally clearing himself of the suspicion of pedophilia that tends to haunt any all-boys school setting. Mathieu's romantic dream is futile, and he humbly fades away at the story's end, like some Gallic pied piper of boy soprano-dom. ""The Chorus"" takes place in post-war France and its topic and look establish immediate links with a bevy of seminal French films. Wayward French boys turn up in boarding schools that are places of both repression and refuge, as you can see in Jean Vigo's school revolution in ""Zero for Conduct"" (1933). The beloved textbook of the French bad-boy tradition is Alain-Fournier's ""Le Grand Meaulnes"" (The Wanderer), which was notably filmed by Jean-Pierre Albicocco in 1967. The tradition becomes more autobiographical in Truffaut's 1959 400 Blows, which introduced the director's alter ego, Jean-Pierre Léaud; and in Malle's moving and long-contemplated memoir of a boarding school in wartime, ""Au Revoir les Enfants"" (1987). Jean Cocteau mythologized a bad-boy idol who haunted him all his life in the Dargélos of ""Les Enfants Terribles"" (1950), made into yet another classic film by Jean-Pierre Melville. This whole idea has remaining traces in the feral youth Gaspard Ulliel plays in André Téchiné's recent ""Strayed."" ""The Chorus,"" it is true, is a relatively conventional entry; except for adding music, it rides upon, rather than transcends, the tradition. But it's a warm story with much charm and little pretension. Barratier himself is a talented musician who, like Mathieu, has drifted into other things. A trained classical guitarist, he won several international competitions after studying at the prestigious École Normale de Musique in Paris, and played professionally for several years. But in 1991 he joined Galatée films to train under his uncle, the renowned actor, producer and writer Jacques Perrin -- who bookends ""The Chorus"" as a Morhange who has grown up into a famous classical conductor. For the next decade Barratier was an associate producer and collaborated with Perrin on ""Children of Lumière,"" ""Microcosmos,"" ""Himalaya"" and ""Winged Migration."" Now he has turned his hand to fiction and directed his own film, with success. There is a risk of preciosity and sweetness, mostly avoided by the dryness of both Mathieu and Rachin as characters, as well as the surviving wickedness of the boys, especially an arch bad-boy, Mondain (Grégory Gatignol). The point of view is Mathieu's and the mature Morhange's, so the film doesn't go as deep into the boys' psyches as it goes into their voice boxes. The director is well connected. He's the son of film actress Eva Simonet and besides his uncle his grandparents were also theater people. The Chorus was top box office in France after its release in March 2004. The French critical reception was pretty mixed, and the film's been reviled by some in the United States as (in one writer's words) ""unbelievably inane, saccharine, and derivative""; ""all smooth, nutrient-free clichés."" Even thumbs-up king Roger Ebert didn't like it: ""this feels more like a Hollywood wannabe than a French film,"" he wrote. ""Where's the quirkiness, the nuance, the deeper levels?"" But it's really a cleanly made, simple, humanistic, and satisfying little film with far less pandering than its critics claim, and whether we like it or not, it's the French Best Foreign Oscar entry, and the little chorus is likely to perform "" Vois sur ton chemin"" on Awards night (if their voices haven't changed). The relatively minimal mise-en-scène and the period setting link it more with its classic film antecedents than with the overproduced ""Very Long Engagement"" (Jeunet's film's Oscar nominations are for décor and photography). Derivative and conventionally themed? Yes. Barratier has acknowledged ""The Chorus's"" inspiration in an earlier film, ""La Cage aux Rossignols"" (The Nightingales' Cage, 1945), which has the same premise -- and anyone can name a long list of movies about teachers who charm their wayward flock. None of them feels -- or sounds -- quite like this movie, though. And the boys do their own singing: the ""tête d'ange"" really has the ""voix d'ange."" American reviewers, missing the nuances, plug Les Choristes into ""Mr. Holland's Opus"" or ""Dead Poets Society"" and find it stereotypically schmaltzy. The gentler French critics don't see those crude comparisons and are able to call it ""un beau film"" and find in it a satisfying example of ""cinéma populaire."" We can too if we open up to it.",,Chris Knipp,2005/02/23,128,112
1364,The Green Mile,Typical US cinematic naivety,"When I watch films like the Green Mile I feel absolutely furious. Mainstream US cinema industry has unfortunately bombarded us with products (I cannot treat them as artworks) of very low quality, to be consumed immediately and provide some instant but short-lived gratification of the senses. Such films trigger shallow reactions of fear, sadness, sympathy etc., but never stick to mind and will never become points to which one would return at leisure to ponder or draw meaning for one's own purposes. Extraordinary and unrealistic situations, special effects, obsession with violence and cruelty, cheap morality and ostensible moral struggle and (on other occasions) sex are the ingredients of 95 per cent of such products. I am deeply sorry that these so-called artists seek to maximise profits at the expense of their art and I hope that they sometime wake up, if they ever can, to complex social realities and relations and to the multiplicity of the human condition, which they so obviously ignore and downgrade.",,turlututu,2003/03/03,34,12
1365,Moon,"Its like it knows what your thinking, but doesn't want to correct you right away","The Sci-Fi department is a very hard market to break. Hence why greatness always seems to come from that genre......because normally when they are made, it usually takes millions of dollars to cover the special effects and what not......so the process of choosing the right script is somewhat limited, but they always leave their mark. However, this one is changing that pace.....in a rhealm of big budget Star Wars and Battlestar Galactica flicks, this movie chooses to take the independent route. By only spending 3 million for its budget, and using old school techniques for its special effects.....can a movie like this thrive in todays market? Well you know how i mentioned that the script selection for a Sci-Fi movie isa very tough market to break......and how the script better be incredible if it is going to make it anywhere........well this movie is just that. This movie was just plain brilliant. For those of you who have no idea what this film is about, allow me to shed some light on the subject.........In the future, our main character Sam Rockwell is living on a one man space station on the moon, whose should purpose it to retrieve and send precious resources from the moon back to the earth.....in this process he becomes very lonely and begins to uncover a horrible truth. The movie is directed and told in such a brilliant fashion......they never try to WOW you with its special effects, which are very moderate but pass with flying colors. Its script and method of storytelling are probably the best part. Instead of answering all of your questions all at once, they sort of draw them out and make you claw and scratch for the truth......but the thing that i like the most is how they approach everything.........they take a route that lets you know that you have seen all the other Sci-Fi classics, and addresses all of your concerns of what may happen or what is going to......and then just carries on like its hidding this secret from you.....almost like the movie knows what your thinking, but chooses not to correct you right away.......brilliantly told and shown in an even better light......and with Clint Mansell directing the musical score(Requiem for a Dream, The Fountain)......my god, how could you not be pulled in. Now the part that i am excited to talk about the most is the acting......because i really have not had anything to rave about so far this year.......but Sam Rockwell is hands down the best actor so far this year. He has already proved himself to me with ""The Green Mile"", ""Frost/Nixon"", and ""Choke""......but he knocked this one out of the park. It was a difficult script to pull off for an actor, and he did it with leaps and bounds.......job well done. I will be very upset if he is not at least nominated this year. Bottom Line.......well, ""Star Trek"" gave you the action/entertainment portion of your Sci-Fi.......whereas this one gives you its underbelly. This is easily one of the best Sci-Fi movies i have seen in a long time, and that is saying a lot coming from me. There was not one thing wrong with this movie......maybe the end was a little sketchy, but it was still not enough to destroy this brilliant film. I urge all of you to go to your local independent movie theatre and watch this movie........you will regret it if you don't.......easily one of the 10 best movies i have seen this year.",8.0,blackmambamark,2009/08/03,250,148
1366,Taxi Driver,What a movie.,"Reading the above comments just makes me reach for the bucket-I may have to reach for the toilet bowl before I finish reading all of them. This movie is a sad excuse for a B-movie. De Niro's acting has never been so poor, with half-lines and a semi-hashed script which would put a soap opera to shame. The movie is slow, for no apparent reason, the ending is nonsensical and the entire movie is random and without purpose or direction. Now, I hear some of the 'fans' out there shouting ""it's meant to be random, that's what Travis was feeling"" or some other wishfully throughout tripe, but come on, give it up, you've pushed this movie up to #37, you've taken the joke too far, give it up. I don't know what Scorcese was thinking, maybe he was going through a lonely period in his life feeling a little down, a little alienated, who knows? He must have gone through a similar patch before making Gangs of New York. I think the only reason why people exaggerate this movie is because they approach it with the formula: De Niro+Scorcese=Ingenious film-making. Hey, it worked for Mean streets, Raging Bull, Goodfellas, Casino. Sorry life, like film-making isn't so simple. You have your good days and your bad days, Taxi Driver was filmed on one of the latter days. Not worth it! p.s The 2 stars the movie got was for De Niro being in it.",2.0,t_dd,2006/04/10,54,25

Being raised in a similar situation where the principle income was coal and refractories while graduating from high school in the 98th percentile in the nation in science, I can identify with these boys challenges, desires, and purpose driven objectives. Many a child in similar situations simply take what is laid before them and turn from the challenge to break the mold and move out into a bigger and more broadened world.

1370,Spider-Man 2,Best Spider-man Film,"Spider-man 2 is a perfect example of a film with a good story with lots of action, drama, entertainment, and has a good love story. This film surpasses the first one and despite the fact I had high expectations for this film, those expectations were sufficiently met. This is the best spider-man film. Sam Raimi returns as the director in this popular movie series. This film covers the emotional battle of Peter Parker and it is handled perfectly. Peter is torn between his duties as Spider-man, his responsibilities as a student, and most of all, his emotions. The result is Peter is uncertain what he wants and what he should do. The ultimate theme, the true test of a hero! What are the choices that Spider-man makes and the actions of those choices. They will define and determine the fate of his character, Spider-man. This story of Spidey's problems is handled perfectly alongside the story behind Doctor Octopus. The special effects in the movie are very good! Although some of the effects at times seemed obviously fake and way overdone! One of which I disliked was the Spider-man/Doc Ock battle on the skyscraper! Other than that, the special effects of the film were very satisfying. Tobey Maguire returns in perhaps his best performance of the movie series. Kirsten Dunst and James Franco are back as Mary Jane and Harry Osborne. I think Franco has a better performance as Harry in this film over the first film. But yet again, just as in the first film, the villain steals the show. Alfred Molina portrays Dr. Octopus. My personal favorite spider-man villain aside from Venom. He handles the character terrificly and the character is used perfectly as well. A good hearted man trapped in a mechanical and ""superior"" intelligence. Molina has the appearance and attitude of Doc Ock. He takes a very serious approach to Doc Ock which is very satisfying. He is a dangerous threat instead of a sometimes viewed old, crazy, and laughable villain. One of the best performances by an actor on a super-villain. He did not disappoint. J.K. Simmons returns in his humorous role as J. Jonah Jameson and Bruce Campbell makes a hysterical cameo appearance. Rosemary Harris portrays Aunt May and in this film, her character is more influential than ever! Her character has always been important to Peter but in this film her role is most significant. She has always been there for Peter but in this film she is able to provide Peter with the most wisdom and guidance he has ever needed. Her character is perfectly portrayed in this film. She is used as a pivotal necessity which is exploited wonderfully. Just an outstanding movie with an outstanding story and an outstanding usage of secondary characters! One of the best comic book films ever made and a true compliment to the Spider-man character. A fantastic film! The only reason I give it a 9 instead of a 10 is that it does not seem as captivating as other movies. It is a good film but I do not really get sucked into it near as much as I do with movies I give higher ratings. An outstanding movie, a must see by spidey lovers and spidey haters alike.",9.0,Lord_Crypto,2007/06/24,19,12

1372,Detachment,An absolute watch!,"Few are the parents who understand that raising a child is not the teacher's responsibility but their own; that their failure as a person should never be taken out on their children, let alone on those who are simply trying hard to make a difference. ""Detachment"" is an absolutely wonderful movie that navigates the incomprehensible world of dysfunctional lives, focusing on lost children and their inner struggles to survive. Brody is fantastic as a teacher who tries to understand his students through his own suffering. It's amazingly actual and depressing; an eye-opener that demands attention and careful thought as it puts us face to face with a reality that many ignore or underestimate, until the moment they become part of it. It's cruel and yet amazingly effective. An absolute watch.",10.0,blogurious,2012/09/20,7,4
1373,Death of a Salesman,Riveting!!! Must see event,"Arthur Miller's compelling work is deftly translated to the small screen here, with riveting performances by Dustin Hoffman as Willy Loman, Kate Reid as Willy's wife Linda, and John Malkovich as the prodigal son Biff. This work touches my soul on several levels: sympathy for the fallen man Willy, understanding of the difficulty of both hating your father and wanting him to be proud of you as Biff shows, and the ever-protective enabler Linda, who defends Willy even as she sees him failing before her eyes. Miller took a simple American family struggling to make life work, and made each character in their own way extraordinary.",8.0,ILuvFlix,1999/01/07,33,26

The plot of the movie is exceptionally brilliant and extra-ordinary. Firstly, I would like to thank the director who directed the movie in a way that totally matched with the writer's thoughts, I believe. Without the eternal connection between the writer & the director, this movie might be a big flop, I don't know! Secondly, Shailene Woodley who played the character of Hazel Grace Lancaster, was a perfect match for the character. And Ansel Elgort acted tremendously well in his Augustus Waters role. So the casting for the leading roles are perfect match, I must say. Finally, I recommend everyone to watch this movie because it's a true masterpiece.",9.0,friendsunitedbd,2014/09/01,10,6

We start off with a bumbling, Keystone-like cop, but a good family man. In fact, he is told he ""wears little girl pants and has balls the size of peas"" because apparently he is very cowardly. Until he realizes his daughter is in danger among the strange happenings in the village, and the one, lone strange man who happens to be the instigator - or is it just a coincidence that he should arrive in town at that time? There are times The Japanese man seems innocent, almost frail. Other times, he seems like an evil force to be reckoned with. As the town falls deeper into hysteria, the people become more desperate, as is always the case when fear rules. Other dark characters emerge - a beautiful ghost woman, and a Shaman. The father does not know who to trust as his daughter becomes more and more endangered. Everyone is suspicious, no one has answers, and fear and judgment have begun to rule the town. Nothing good can come of such an environment. Will redemption and faith prevail, or will fear and prejudice be the Devil's spoils? You will have to see to find out.",7.0,wildsparrow16,2016/09/13,18,8
1378,Intermission,An Instant Cult Classic,"As another IMDb user said, it resembles an Irish Pulp Fiction... and it really does. There are intertwining stories, great (though sometimes subtle) humor, and fun acting. I'm not sure how authentically Irish this movie is, as an Irish user seemed to think in his review that it was made to reflect what Americans thought of Ireland... there may be some truth to his words, and if so, I curse the stereotypes that caused this film to veer from true Irish.....necity. In any event, it was still a lot of fun and probably gave at least a small look in the direction of the true Ireland. And though I doubt the lives of most Irishmen are like the lives of the characters in ""Intermission"" on a daily basis, we again probably have somewhat of a glimpse via dialogue, locations, and Ireland's beer of choice (or maybe Guiness just payed a lot to get in on the project). In any event, it's a lot different from the films that take place in America, and this is definitely for the better. Even if it wasn't pure Irish, it was still lot's of fun. The opening scene was one of the best I've ever viewed, and the ending matched (the middle seemed to drop a bit lower, but it was still good). Colin Farrel, though limited in his character's development and personality range, has a lot of contagious fun. Cillian Murphy is also quite good: American audiences might know him better as the bad guy in ""Red Eye."" Colm Meaney also provides a strong support for the movie. In a nutshell, this is a film that manages to have a LOT of fun without resorting to the xXx Syndrome, where everything is basically blown up. What I mean is a lot of people only consider action films fun, but this one is a great example of a non-action film that (for that very reason) has so much fun. In fact, the fact that it can pull this off exponentially increases its fun. This is a must-see for independent film-buffs and/or foreign film-buffs. Others still might like it, too. Watch out for Colin Farrell singing ""I Fought the Law"" (or ""I Fought the Lore,"" in this case), a store manager who, as they say in America, is a pain in the butt (you'll know what I mean if you see it), and a kid who likes to randomly throw bricks.... imagine the possibilities.....",8.0,deltajuliet,2006/02/21,0,0
1379,Primal Fear,Truly Unforgettable,"""Primal Fear"" is irresistible to anyone who enjoys courtroom dramas or psychological thrillers as it has a twisted plot that remains both gripping and immensely entertaining from beginning to end. It's really well written, well acted and also has an exceptionally good ending. The characters are particularly interesting and three of them are gradually revealed to be significantly less straightforward than they first appear. Martin Vail (Richard Gere) is a very confident defense attorney who loves publicity and seeks out high profile cases which are likely to get plenty of media coverage, so when a young alter boy called Aaron Stampler (Edward Norton) is arrested and accused of having murdered the Archbishop of Chicago, Vail offers his services on a pro bono basis. At first Vail's chances of success appear to be slim as all the available evidence points strongly to Aaron's guilt. Things seem to change, however, when Vail discovers that, not only had the Archbishop been involved in some dubious land deals in which a number of powerful people had lost a great deal of money, but also, he had subsequently received numerous death threats. Janet Venable (Laura Linney), who happens to be Vail's ex-lover, is assigned by the D.A. to prosecute the case and is instructed to press hard for the death penalty. The D.A.'s own actions are then called into question by Vail when it comes to light that he had been one of the people who'd lost money in the shady land deals. When Vail finds out that the Archbishop had also sexually abused the alter boys and that Aaron had been one of his victims, he's initially uncertain what to do with the information because making it generally available would give his client a strong motive for the crime and the lack of an apparent motive was the only real weakness in the prosecution's case. Vail's dealings with Aaron and the information he discovers about the activities of the Archbishop and the D.A. lead him to believe in his client's innocence and the means by which he proceeds to defend Aaron against the prosecution's accusations turns out to be highly unorthodox and extremely fascinating to watch. ""Primal Fear"" has many moments of suspense and humour and also features a talented cast who provide some fine performances. Richard Gere's role enables him to display more subtlety than he's generally required to show and Edward Norton's Oscar nominated screen debut is utterly sensational. This movie stands out so strongly against others of its type that it and Norton's amazing contribution are both truly unforgettable.",9.0,seymourblack-1,2011/08/09,9,7

1381,Crash,Bold and Compelling Treatise on Racism in Modern Society,"Take the pop-cultured infused socio-political discourse of a Spike Lee movie, the glossy grit of a Michael Mann LA crime story, and the compelling mosaic story-telling technique of a Paul Thomas Anderson film, and you'll get the ""feel"" for Paul Haggis' stunning directorial debut. To boil a film like ""Crash"" down to such terms, however, would do it severe injustice. Powerful and thought provoking, this is the most accomplished and compelling film since ""21 Grams"" premiered back at the end of 2003. ""Crash"" brilliantly shows through intertwining vignettes, that are often blazingly funny in their brutal honesty and fascinatingly gut-wrenching in their melodrama, how subtle racism (often guised in nervous humor) and overt prejudice (often exasperated by sudden irrational violence and an overabundance of readily available firearms) completely permeate our culture and everyday interactions within society. A hyper intelligent script showcases not characters, but brilliant representations of real people, people we know and pass in the street every day, people not unlike us. People who at first seem to be lost causes in the war against racism (witnessed in Matt Dillon's harried beat cop and Sandra Bulluck's spoiled District Attorney's wife) can often become the most unlikely solutions to the problem, while people who ride in on their high horse (witnessed in Ryan Phillipe's noble young police officer) can turn against the tide in the blink of an eye. No one is immune to it no matter how hard they try to rise above it (witnessed in Don Cheadle's quietly tragic detective). In the end, everyone is flawed, the racism is inescapable, and the audience feels a twinge of sympathy for just about everyone. Perhaps that is what Haggis is hinting at to be our answer. Showing empathy and being able to relate even on the most remote level to every human being out there is the first step to that true brotherhood of man. Because the film offers no real solution, the discussion and discourse it creates in the minds of the viewers is the first step in solving society's ills. We can't tackle everything at once, but we can open a dialogue, and hopefully, one person conversing with another will be the first step to our salvation. It takes a bold film to raise such questions, and an even greater one to compel an audience to talk about the potential answers, and that is exactly what ""Crash"" accomplishes.",9.0,WriterDave,2005/05/07,748,433
1382,Hotel Transylvania,A Waste of Animators,"Hotel Transylvania has occasionally cute moments and intermittently interesting art design (otherwise, it's mostly K-Mart Hallowe'en décor), but the story is trite, hackneyed, cliché, and any other words you can think of that mean: nobody broke a sweat on the script or on the plot. The voices are mostly uninteresting, except for Steve Buscemi, who attracts interest by demonstrating that he was catastrophically miscast as the Werewolf. The film is also aimed at a very, very young age group, something you might not understand from seeing the trailer, which makes the film seem about 10 times more sophisticated than it actually is. If you've got little kids, take 'em. If you don't, you'll fall asleep about halfway through the opening credits. If you do go, DO NOT spring the extra bucks for the 3D version. There's about as much 3D here as there is on your average Etch-A-Sketch.",3.0,wricketts,2012/10/07,36,15

As some other guy here said, movies that show a lot of interconnected subplots that elevate the level of intimate knowledge about the characters is unlikely to get old, at most it is in danger of being done to death. Bottom line: this is an Irish ""Crash"". I found it well done and funny, although a bit slow at times and you have to strain your ears a bit if English is not your mother tongue.

1385,Ferris Bueller's Day Off,Nostalgic for a certain age group but otherwise unremarkable,"More than twenty years after its release ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" is something of a cult classic. Simply put, it's the story of one young man's struggle to take it easy. The title character is played by Matthew Broderick and, for me, that's where the problems start. I'm not a Broderick fan at the best of times and here it's twice as bad since he's playing a character that I find it very difficult to like. I blame John Hughes's script for giving little or no justification of why Ferris is almost universally liked. Ferris's pal Cameron (Alan Ruck) is a little more engaging but his girlfriend Sloane (Mia Sara) serves no discernible function other than that of eye-candy. Easily the best effort in the acting department comes from Jeffrey Jones who gives an iconic performance as the dean who's out to get Ferris. Considering these characters, the story is unsurprisingly slight. The trio basically drive around town in a Ferrari and supposedly live life to its fullest, though in actuality doing little of consequence. Adding just a smidgen of depth to the proceedings is the introduction of a crisis that will force Cameron to decide if he'll finally start standing up to his father. The direction by John Hughes (who was also the screenwriter) is well handled though not particularly remarkable. The soundtrack is a typical 80's melange, complete with Yello's soon-to-be-cliché ""Oh Yeah"". I would say that the production values are solid but they're not going to turn the tide if you can't connect with the characters. If you have fond memories of this film then I doubt that they'll be dashed by seeing it again but if you didn't see it back in the 80's then I wouldn't really recommend seeing it now.",7.0,sme_no_densetsu,2008/09/22,13,7
1386,Goodfellas,One of Scorcese's Masterpieces,"'Goodfellas' is right up there with the best of Martin Scorcese. I recently hauled this out for a re-viewing and I was surprised at how totally up to date it felt. How relevant the plot was, how topical the story. And for a mafia movie of that era, how the women were brought front and centre and given a narrative voice - Karen Hill (played by Lorraine Bracco), the wife of the protagonist, Henry Hill (played by a riveting Ray Liotta) both get to tell their stories. The movie is based on a true story and the cast are awesome. At this later viewing I was particularly interested to see many of ""The Sopranos"" cast, here making their debuts in a similar crime-family drama. The movie is astounding in that it brings complexity, a riveting script, brilliant relevant music (with actual stars performing their hits) and mind boggling tracking shots, the most difficult of all movie sequencing. Scorcese, or his ensemble, do not flinch from the complexity of this and afterwards, one wonders at how many takes were involved. We are drawn into the intimate life of a crime family, the gradual desensitizing to the horror of the life, driven by material greed at any cost, including the callous snuffing of lives. The large ensemble cast (both known and unknown and including both of Scorcese's parents in brilliant sidebits), the cinematography, editing and dialogue are all masterful. De Niro is at his charming best,Joe Pesci captivates as a psychotic, insecure 'made' man Lorraine Bracco is masterful in a fully developed role, Ray Liotta is marvellous in the way he depicts the reality of the hoodlum life, the juxta-positioning of sauce making against the back drop of victim burials. Paul Sorvino, Michael Imperioli, Debi Mazar, Samuel L. Jackson, Illeana Douglas and Kevin Corrigan all add to the over all engrossing engagement of the film. 8 out of 10. Not to be missed.",8.0,wisewebwoman,2008/02/17,8,4
1387,The Fault in Our Stars,"So very disappointing. It seduces teenagers, but what do they know?...","It's a pity. A book like this, one in a decade, from an incredibly talented author, to have this fate! A disastrous film, nothing works. First, the script: Almost always it's different from the book it's based upon, which is not a bad thing, but here, we have a complete misunderstanding from the script writers. Green constructed his story so beautifully, piece by piece with the precision of a clockwork. All of his work went down the drain. I don't want to go into the details of the story, but if you've read the book, just don't see this film. The casting is a joke. Two perfectly healthy young boy and girl, pretend to be suffering from cancer. Not even their make up is believable. Willian Dafoe even worse of his usual bad self. A disaster. The director is a complete failure, in directing actors, as well as picturing interior, or exterior spaces. Last but not least, the music is so bad, it sounds like a cheap - very cheap - TV series selection. Everything in this film is so bad, I wouldn't know which is worse.

Most of us are secretly yearning to find the secret of how to make money and to achieve an easy life. What makes a salesman successful? He has to be liked, and he has to build up a momentum of confidence and self-esteem which is easily destroyed if a sale goes wrong or there's trouble at home.

The tension that builds in this movie is really terrifying and will stick with you for a while. I literally had a nightmare the same night after watching this movie; such was its effect. I think, the emotional struggle of a father and the sheer determination to fight the odds to help his child was captured beautifully. Also, there is a certain intangible weirdness in this movie that makes it really unique, served with some brilliant acting.

It just could have been so much more, with long scenes of seemingly irrelevant conversations and little about them. I felt that I didn't really know either of them at the end and it was all just a huge disappointment. It is a typical Hollywood conversion of a good book into an innocuous film.

There is a shootout and Vincent and Jules do not die because the shots of one gangster fails the target. Jules believes that God's hand has interfered in the bullets and he decides to redeem himself from his life of gangster. Vincent is assigned by Marsellus to go out with his wife Mia (Uma Thurman)while he is traveling and he is scared when she has an OD. Marsellus pays the boxer Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) to lose his fight on the fifth round, but Butch wins the fight. He flees from Marsellus and his gangsters but his girlfriend Fabienne (Maria de Medeiros) forgets to bring his golden watch that belongs to his family for many generations. Butch returns to his apartment and he faces Vincent first and Marsellus later. But an incident with sadistic perverts brings Marsellus and Butch side by side. ""Pulp Fiction"" is one of my favorite movies ever. I had seen this movie for the last time on 11 January 2002 and today I have just watched it again. When we compare the nominations for Best Picture in the 1995 Oscar (""Pulp Fiction"", ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and the winner and weakest ""Forrest Gump"") with the movies nominated this year we can see that the Oscar winners are not necessarily the best movies of the cinema history. ""Pump Fiction"" saved the career of John Travolta that was in the ostracism and put on the spot Quentin Tarantino after the cult ""Reservoir Dogs"".

1393,Detachment,ubiquitous assimilation!!,"Detachment is a dark movie which everyone can relate with, the solitariness, the cynicism, the despair and the darker shades of our lives which we cover with many other things. It doesn't end on a good note unlike the common genre movies - it could have easily drifted that way to be more appealing. But then who's gonna live happily forever!! Though the education system and the schools and the students ain't that evil and rotten the way its shown in the movie, it does pose many a question, the dubious system in which everything goes on without a point. The miserable life of teachers were beautifully shown, yes they do go through worse situations. Adrien Brody does something meaty after pianist as the cool, composed and ailing substitute teacher. The climax was so dramatic and metaphorical, the background score adds value to the visual richness. The screenplay is too dark at times, the lighter moments and the virtuous elements highly underplayed though it saves the movie many a time from drowning.

1394,October Sky,don't they know who von Braun is?,"-----ONE OR TWO SPOILERS AHEAD------ Looking around the comments index and this film gets deserved praise. Inspirational is the best word to describe its main theme: small town boy and friends rise up against their pre-ordained careers as coal miners to pursue rocket science. Gyllenhaal does a wonderful job as the seemingly not so bright daydreamer who one day looks up in awe at the vision of the Russian satellite 'Sputnik' (the first space 'vehicle' to be launched into orbit by man) and decides to reach for the stars. The townspeople are also fascinated and yet scared of this new thing streaking across the sky which some believe to be of imminent danger to them. But as they look up, a wonderful comment comes out from the crowd which to me sums up the hard pressed, struggling yet somehow joyous spirit of this community. A man says 'I hope they don't drop a bomb on this place.....it'd be a terrible waste of a bomb!' There must have been thousands of small yet spiritied communities like this in the US during the 50s. And it's from this essential ruggedness, and perhaps innocence, I suppose young men like Homer Hickam were launched into the world. Hickam's father's initial relutance to support his son's 'crazyness' is understandable considering the great sacrifices and suffering he and his colleagues down the mines have given in order to give their children a decent living. Gradually though, the barriers are worn down and perhaps the gifts of Homer inspire something different in his father as we are drawn to the inevitable conclusion. One thing that puzzled me throughout though was the attitude and respect given to a certain Wernher von Braun. Fair enough, the man was a rocketing genius but his full scale participation in and innovative designs for the V1 and V2 rockets of Nazi Germany led to the deaths of thousands of innocents (both rocket victims and the actual slave labourers). Perhaps one of the morals of the film is that greatness in human advance and technology can ultimately be born from the more malignant and terrifying aspects in our nature. Thus Hickam embarks on a career as a rocket scientist and his inspiration is a former Nazi rocket scientist! The other aspect to the film was moving too. The irony of a Soviet satellite inspiring a 17 year old American to go out and design rockets to launch into space. There's a profound lesson here for cooperation amongst different peoples and nations. Great film!",,Joker-26,2003/01/18,1,1
1395,Spider-Man 2,The best one out of the trilogy.,"Sequels are very tricky. They're very hard to crack open, but every so often we do get a sequel that is better than the original like Empire Strikes Back, The Godfather Part II, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Aliens, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, The Dark Knight, and others. Spider-Man 2 is one of them. The common thing among mostly all sequels is that bigger is better, that's not always the case, and that's where director Sam Raimi comes in, he does the opposite. He makes it smaller, more personal, but with big impactful moments. Here we see a damaged Peter Parker, still full of guilt with the death of Uncle Ben, he's getting fired all the time and late to school because he's busy protecting New York as Spider-Man. His relationship between Harry and Mary Jane are deteriorating as he keeps disappointing them. In the end, he gives up his duties as Spider-Man, only to return to action when Doctor Octopus is threatening the city. This movie in many ways is a coming of age story for Peter Parker. With a moving romantic subplot, Peter learns to accept his responsibilities as Spider-Man in the long run, and puts that first above all his desires including Mary Jane, and he also finds closure by telling Aunt May the truth about what happened on the night of Uncle Ben's murder. Tobey Maguire brings much depth and complexity to Peter Parker. A very fine performance by him showcasing the right amount of emotion in every single scene. Alfred Molina is excellent here as Dr. Otto Octavius, also known as Doctor Octopus, whom Peter deems as his idol in the beginning of the film. What makes him such as awesome and likable villain, is that film allows you to like him from the beginning, and to see his downfall to villainy, then to a redeemable hero at the end makes an engaging story. Give credit to Raimi and his writing team, as they provide Doc Ock much needed flare. Kirsten Dunst here is pretty good as Mary Jane. Peter and Mary Jane also get a lot time bickering at each other here. It's a very complicated and complex romance as she wants Peter and Peter wants her, but he can't cause of his duties as a crime-fighter. James Franco is great playing the a-hole friend. As an audience member it's very sad to see their friendship deteriorate as Harry questions Peter's loyalty to him or to Spider-Man. The action serves the story here, it seamlessly transitions to action set pieces while still serving the narrative. Not to mention they are awesome. All the fights between Spidey and Doc Ock are an adrenaline rush, particularly the subway train fight. But with that being said, if you took out all the action sequences in this movie, you still have a very intriguing and moving story to watch. That's how good this film is. Raimi and his crew of filmmakers did a tremendous job with Spider-Man 2. There are real human moments in this film, one of them involves Spidey and a group of civilians in the train. A real nice, tender, and human scene. Rosemary Harris as Aunt May even has a substantial role in the film as Peter's moral compass and she also has an action sequence in the middle of the film. J.K. Simmons is even better as J. Jonah Jameson this time around and has the film's funniest moments. Everything in this film clicks on all cylinders. The music by Danny Elfman is better than ever, and also provides the film with lots of tender scores. The visual effects are better, Spidey's web-swinging abilities are better, the romance is better, the action is better, the sound mixing and editing is better, the story, the acting, just everything. It's pretty much a perfect film. I for one thought it deserved just a little bit more from the Academy Awards other than winning the well deserved special effects award. 10/10",10.0,drawlife,2014/09/28,19,13

This invention consists of a built-in shower gel & shampoo in the shower head. They look for investors. A businessman named Bert Hanson(Christoph Waltz) shows interest in the trio's product. He agrees to buy their product for a lot of money. However, he later double crosses them. This prompts Nick, Kurt & Dale to plan a kidnapping involving Hanson's son, Rex Hanson(Chris Pine). Horrible Bosses 2 is freaking hilarious! I was laughing non-stop from start to finish. At first, I was skeptical when I learned that they were making a sequel to Horrible Bosses(2011). However, all my doubts were laid to rest when I started watching the movie. Every single joke in this film had me guffawing uncontrollably. There were some scenes that were so funny that I was struggling to catch my breath! The cast works really well together & you can tell that they had a whale of a time shooting this movie. Jason Bateman is great as Nick Hendricks. Jason Sudeikis is brilliant as Kurt Buckman. Charlie Day is outstanding as Dale Arbus. Jennifer Aniston is spectacular as Dr. Julia Harris, D.D.S. Kevin Spacey is hysterical in his short but important role as Dave Harken. Jamie Foxx is mind blowing as Dean ""MF"" Jones. Chris Pine is awesome as Rex Hanson. Christoph Waltz is good as Bert Hanson. Jonathan Banks & Lindsay Sloane are impressive as Detective Hatcher & Stacy Arbus respectively. If you liked Horrible Bosses then you will love Horrible Bosses 2. This film stays true to the spirit of the original & improves upon it. Go, watch it right away & laugh till your sides hurt!",10.0,Anurag-Shetty,2014/11/30,63,30
1397,Death of a Salesman,Terrible movie.,"Hoffman is an okay actor but he was not up to this role. He comes across simply as a nerdish failure of man and the film misses Miller's point entirely. Possibly the director deserves the blame but the film is a great disappointment. It's not worth seeing. Compare his performance to Lee J. Cobb's tour de force in '66. Cobb breathes life and spirit into this tragic man. And the supporting cast is flawless. Frederick March did a good job back in the '51 film but Cobb IS Willie Loman. He owns the role and trying to replace him is like Steve Martin trying to be Peter Sellars. Some actors just own certain roles and Cobb owns SALESMAN. If you're interesting in seeing this film, get the Lee J. Cobb version. It's the real thing!",2.0,rcody111,2006/03/03,13,1
1398,October Sky,The best father/son movie of all time,"""October Sky"" is alot of different types of movies rolled all together. It's a coal-mining movie. It's a ""follow your dreams"" movie. It's a period piece. However, at the heart of the film is the most accurate and poignant portrayal of the father/son dynamic that I have ever seen in a film. Homer Hickham is a son who has been told since the day he was born that he was going to grow up to work in the coal mines. That is what everyone before him has done and all of his contemporaries have resigned themselves to the fact that that is what they will do. However, Homer wants to build rockets and he seesa first prize at the national science fair as a ticket out of Coalwood and straight to college. Homer's father has worked in the mines his whole life and sees nothing practical or worthwhile in Homer's fascination with rockets, but, more importantly, he sees Homer's desire to leave as a huge insult. He thinks that Homer wants to get away from the town so that he doesn't have to follow in his father's footsteps. The interaction between father and son is at once frustrating, hurtful, loving, insightful and bittersweet. There are always kind words that can't be spoken and harsh words that can't help but be shouted. This realism is at the core of this incredibly moving screenplay, which is only made palpable by the equally moving performances. If you are looking for a great drama that is family appropriate, smartly written and inspiring, I highly recommend this little-known gem!",10.0,elispaul,2003/07/19,1,1

1400,The Wailing,1 hour too long mashed genre,If you watch this movie without knowing the synopsis you will keep guessing what this movie is all about.. Is it a crime movie? Is it a zombie movie or a monster movie? The early part is too slow and filled with annoying stupidity of those sissy policemen.. The multiple plot twists within the last 10 minutes are the only part that I enjoy but it could not save the whole rhythm of this movie.. Its unsettling but it does not create a lasting impression..

1401,The Fault in Our Stars,"In the wake of Twilight's conservatism, it is a shame that this fascinating material has been given such a risk-averse treatment","What inspired John Green to write his six novels, including ""The Fault in our Stars"", was the suffering he witnessed during his five month stint as a student chaplain in a children's hospital. In an interview with The Sydney Morning Herald he explained how this experience shaped his religious and social views: ""I was enrolled in divinity school and thought I was going to become a minister - I'm Episcopalian - but I was disavowed of that notion pretty quickly while working at the hospital."" One lesson he learned was the joy that could be found in a short life, a central theme of this film adaptation. Green has a double major in English and Religious Studies, which helped to develop and sell the novel. It was on the New York Times bestseller list, so the film treatment was inevitable, particularly at a time when young adult books are servicing teenage girls where Hollywood has failed them. I haven't read the novel but from watching the film and learning about Green's background it is clear there are religious metaphors explored in both texts. This adaptation is about Hazel, a teenage girl who was treated for thyroid cancer as a child and now carries an oxygen tank with her everywhere. Due to the weakness in her lungs, she is bored, alone and prepared to die. In a recovery group, she meets a young man named Augustus who lost one of his legs to cancer and they toy with the idea of a relationship together. Through his religious values Green is using both these characters as a metaphor for Christ's suffering. Christ died at thirty-three, a young age, but the Bible suggests his death helped enrich people's lives. Similarly, one of the key lines of the film is ""pain must be felt"", which stresses the importance of understanding one's preparation for death and also remembering people with fondness once they die. The title of the story is more ambiguous but also encompasses its own Biblical connotations. The love interest in the film is Augustus, which is a significant name in the Bible. Caesar Augustus, ruler of the Roman Empire, was influential in Christ's birth when he ordered a census be taken for every living person. People had to return to their own towns to be registered, which sent Joseph back to Bethlehem and where Christ would be born. The Star of Bethlehem led people to discover the birth of Christ and later redemptive suffering. Augustus is a Christ-like figure, a star for Hazel, because he helps her discover the beauty in pain by adding love and joy to her life in spite of the inevitability of their deaths. An early scene in the film pokes fun at some of these ideas, with the recovery group being organised by a religious man who lays out a mat with a picture of Jesus on it. The scene is funny and cynical because it's easy to scoff at him when seeing what the kids have been through. The first shot of Augustus' titanium leg gives a frightful jolt. It's one of the film's few real moments. Yet these same religious undertones in Green's book must have impressed a lot of people. Green is part of the Episcopal Church, a denomination of Christianity, which would have added to the novel's bankability. Through Twilight Stephenie Meyer transformed conservative religious values into a rich commodity and Mormonism was suddenly cool again. In the wake of Twilight's conservatism, it is a shame that this fascinating material has been given such a risk-averse treatment. The director was Josh Boone, whose only other feature was Stuck in Love. His direction lacks creativity and the film suffers from it's over length. The camera-work is largely static and few staging directions have been given to the actors, who are either standing stationary or sitting down. The best choice he makes is planting the camera in tight close-ups on Hazel's face. She's played by Shailene Woodley (The Descendants, Divergent), a gifted young actress who raises the material because of the natural expressions she discovers on her brow. During an early group meeting, she shows her discomfort with Augustus looking at her only through her expressions, no words. Conversely, Boone lets the co-lead Ansel Elgort overact with a theatrical style of acting and such overt niceness that it lessens the believability of his near-perfect character. Some of the blame should fall on the source material and the film's screenwriters. Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber wrote The Spectacular Now, but their script is sorely lacking in conflict between the leads. Augustus and Hazel's pleasantries drain the film of any tension. They're better conservationalists than Bella and Edward, discussing the inevitability of oblivion, but the plotting around them is dull and increasingly episodic like book chapters. Too little is also made of the adult characters, with Laura Dern given a terribly underwritten role as Hazel's mother. More conflict could have been generated through the desires of both sets of parents. Twilight was foremost about chastity but hid it well under the vampire genre. This film suffers a similar fate: it is about dying, grief and remembrance but spends considerably more time on whether Hazel and Augustus should date or not and swanning around Amsterdam. It is an injustice to Green's experiences because he saw real suffering, which doesn't translate here nearly as strongly as it should.",5.0,Likes_Ninjas90,2014/05/28,36,15
1402,Detachment,Detachment is how movies SHOULD be done.,"Detachment is a movie that on the surface deals with problems that teachers face in the public school system. And in many ways, it is a movie about that. However, the subtext involves much greater themes of abandonment, parental responsibility, lost hope and the need for acceptance without judgment. There is no way to escape labeling this film as brilliant. There isn't a slow spot in the film's pacing, the acting from the entire cast is astounding and the script is amazingly executed. The main character, Henry, a substitute teacher, deals with the death of his mother as a child by care taking for everyone that comes close to him but himself. This dichotomy in his life comes to a head with two young girls that he has reached out to in very different (and dramatic) ways. By trying to give the love that he was denied for years, he has set himself up for a fall (and a rebirth) as both a man and a teacher. Anyone who has dealt with public schools as a student and certainly a teacher should watch this.",9.0,vanityinjah,2012/10/14,7,5
1403,Primal Fear,PRIMAL FEAR (DIDIER BECU),"It's not the first movie that shows Richard Gere as a lawyer and it won't be the last one I suppose but this courtdrama really worked well. Not because of Gere as he is just good looking (well at least my wife says), not because of Laura Linney as she's the kind of woman you wanna give a slap on the face the first moment you meet her but because the perfect performance from Edward Norton who plays the role of an orphan who is accussed of having murdered the bhishop who cared about him since he was a child. At least that's how it looks like for the outside world cos inside the church a whole shocking drama took place and it's definitely the kind of cinemafood for religious fanatics. I am not going to write down spoilers but you will be shocked at the end and the director Gregory Hoblit (recently he made Harts War with Bruce Willis) made a cool film about it....

1404,The Chorus,One of the Most Powerful Films on the Importance of Music.,"'Les Chorsites' - though the theme or the concept is not completely fresh, the character depth, incredible acting and a heart-wrenchingly beautiful score makes it one of the most powerful films on the importance of music. Like critic Richard Roeper says, ""This film really isn't about surprising us. It's about hitting all the right notes with grace and warmth."" Music and Sports are the backbone of a society. Music not only teaches discipline, teamwork and timing, but it can actually affect and mould people's lives. I'm the kind of person who, upon hearing a brilliant piece of music, gets so overwhelmed that my eyes well up. And this film manages to do it on more than one occasion. People, and especially kids, need music in their lives; the world is a much beautiful place with music around.",8.0,akash_sebastian,2013/03/28,0,0

In my modest opinion, Interstellar is the best Sci-Fi in human history. Believe it or not. It's the simple and the complicated, It's the usual and the different, It's the mind and the heart, It's an emotional and psychological journey through the unknown which has its own stunning visuals. It's an original story and thought-provoking masterpiece. Every single time with him, you just got crazy about his ideas, astonished by his mind games and inspired when he talks to the heart. Back then, he was an ambitious young director. And with his capabilities made his own way straight through the world. Now, he is an icon and a legend of directing. He is Christopher Nolan...

1406,Blackfish,More like a trailer but gives you all you need to work with,"Going back and watching again for the first time since it was released, Blackfish now seems more like an hour and half trailer in that it skims and crams in the most important aspects as best it can from nearly 50yrs of very complex history and dynamics between humans and Orca. It was without question an important film and essential for people to watch but it doesn't and can't possibly give the full ins and outs of everything. It requires its audience to delve deeper and research for themselves. For the most part people hadn't really given much thought into the background of the whales they saw in shows and bought the whole notion these happy, cuddly and loveable animals that enjoy putting on performances with trainers. To add to the perpetual idea it's all good comes the marketing of SW and I guess audiences would understandably assume they must be telling the truth about it all. Turned out they weren't telling many the people the truth at all - not even the trainers. The aim of the film wasn't to ruin SW but more to give the wider world a heads up which it did to incredible effect. I'll be honest in saying not all of the interviews with former trainers struck me as being necessarily true, impartial or convincing but again, it needs audiences to do more research for themselves rather than take everything at face value. It leaves you with more questions than answers which leaves it up to us to decide whether to go and find out more or leave it there. It struck me as an odd thing to see the last shot of Dawn lying alongside Tilikum because having heard others speak of how she was the mother hen of everyone, constantly making sure staff knew the drill, did things by the book and were always safe made me wonder how on Earth she put herself physically in that position. That led to further research in which I discovered that according to SW's own policy and protocol, she was technically doing ""dry-work"" with him. Lying down alongside him in that water was according to SW - ""dry work"" and that made me read up more, find out even more absurd information and realise how every single trainer is put at risk, blamed and has the onus placed on them personally for every incident that occurs. Again you don't realise the extent of this until you go digging and reading up further. It's amazing SW were allowed to operate these nonsensical policies for so long and only fined the equivalent of pennies for having placed trainers at risk. That said having seen a short clip of the footage where Ken Peters was dragged underneath the water repeatedly by Kasatka, makes you wonder how and why he of all people didn't jump on the Blackfish bandwagon. KP remains at SW, has not been particularly vocal or keen to slate the movie itself but says people need to understand and do their own research before making up there mind about the park. I'm with him 100% on that but just wish we could get more from that side of the fence and in particular hear more from Ken Peters but sadly, SW declined all opportunities and refused to have any involvement at all. It would be interesting to have some follow up to Blackfish now that we're nearing a decade later and give SW some opportunity to set the record straight now they have stopped the breeding programme and made shows educational rather than entertainment. Worst thing for me is how SW conducted itself after the release of Blackfish,during the court hearings and how appalling it was to realise the extent of their efforts to discredit, blame and shirk responsibility for everything. More or less every response has read and sounded like that of a petulant teenager whose nose is out of joint. It picked apart ""Blackfish"" but with such ridiculous focus on things like the narration being about one whale when footage clearly shows another. The recording of the 911 call from staff that state ""a whale has eaten one of the trainers"" was deemed later by SW as being inaccurate which it was but it was the actual recording by very clearly distressed staff in the immediate aftermath and total confusion. That's not a deliberate attempt to lie and paint things in a different light it's merely giving the audience some insight into what happened, how it affected everyone and the total shock and confusion of it all in the immediate aftermath. They constantly shirked responsibility about Loro Parque stating it is not owned by SW even though the whales belonged to them (still do) and the young trainer was killed during a session being directly supervised by a senior SW trainer. It isn't mentioned during Blackfish but another young trainer was nearly killed at Loro Parque during a separate and horrifying incident of aggression. This also happened during a session under the direct supervision of a SW trainer. They duck, dive and dodge as much as possible which gives even less credibility and generally adds to the theory and views they can't be trusted. SW has since released YouTube clips claiming ""so called expert"" Dr Ingrid Visser is clueless even trying to suggest she is guilty of harassing wild orca. Interestingly and again what you won't know without digging and reading further is that they approached Dr Visser initially with the hope of her testifying for them to state how it is not inherently dangerous to swim with Orca. They then turned on her when she refused to be on side and have been trying to discredit her ever since. It's just childish, petty and unprofessional nonsense you would not expect from a huge corporation that has the means, finances, resources and could still recover and even profit if they got on board with plans and proposals for sea pens and sanctuaries. In fairness, SW has not captured wild orca in decades. Whilst the world is tearing shreds out of them, there are still captures taking place even now with orca captured on contracts bought / sold and shipped to and from parks in Russia, China and Japan. We need to stop this incessant fixation with SW and turn our attention to other places that are still doing all this for profit. So overall, Blackfish did a great job of highlighting issues and bringing the world's attention to what needed our attention. It's not dishonest and it's not an unfair portrayal either. If you feel things don't add up or there's more to it than meets the eye you can go and find out all those answers and do your own research which effectively is the aim here. It's not an in-depth or really detailed movie it can't be - there is far too much going on for it to be possible but as a film / documentary it gives a skimming the surface, fair and accurate insight into what the world never knew happened at all before The difficulty is that even after the death of Dawn Brancheau, SW continued to tarnish, vilify and blame her for what happened essentially aiming to continue this absurd notion it was a one-off and she to blame. Blackfish is a hugely important film but it's far from a full, fair story. That is down to the viewer to take further and decide for themselves.",10.0,charlyparly,2019/07/11,3,3

Everyone else in the movie serve little purpose but to act utterly stupid, and help glorify the character that is Ferris. It's not the type of message you want to send out to a world that is full of people already interested in only living for themselves & self-glorification. Let's just reinforce all that shall we?

1410,Detachment,Depressing,"So last night on Netflix, we had a choice of two movies, Dallas buyers club and this, i decided that Dallas Buyers Club looked a bit too depressing for a Friday night. So we opted for this. IMDb average rating on this 7.7 ? Seriously did all the people who have raved about this forget to take their Prozac this morning? Im glad I didn't forget to take mine! First of all the cast list looked like it was going to great, Adrien Brody, Bryan Cranston (who was in it for all of 2 minutes if that whose appearance had no relevance to the story whatsoever) Lucy Liu yeah she was in it but for what purpose? No idea. SO this teacher is a substitute who is 'detached from emotion' due to his mums suicide when he was little and we are left wondering if granddad abused her, with no real background just snippets of dodgy camera work in whacked out colours. He takes pity on an underage prostitute and takes her under his wing. One of the pupils who he is teaching likes him, says she wants to talk asks him if he likes her, he consoles her by giving her a cold hearted cuddle and then gets practically accused of touching her, leaving her to commit suicide and he tries to save her. No idea about the relationship with the prostitute as he didn't get it on with her-and think they may have been just friends. Suspected paedo Grandpa died in a nursing home that weren't looking after him. In a nutshell thats about it. Adrien Brody was emotionally detached hence the name of the film. But left me emotionally detached as a viewer thinking seriously what is the point of this. My husband was left physically detached as he fell asleep!

1411,Hotel Transylvania,Please give this review a read (I give this movie a 6.75 / 10 rating),"Hotel Transylvania is a good, entertaining movie for kids and adults alike. The storyline is simple, yet touching: Count Dracula creates a hotel, which is to be a safe haven for the monsters from the human world. Dracula's main goal is to keep his daughter, Mavis, safe from the outside world. However, a human makes his way into the hotel, falls in love with Drac's daughter, and thus spirals out of control from there with chaos and turmoil through-out the movie as the Count tries to keep the human away. The plot is executed very well, touching the hearts of viewers with the relationship between the Count and his daughter. The many powers and speedy movement of the Count is very entertaining to watch, his character is portrayed very well and seems to be one of the most loved characters of the movie. This movie contains a little bit of everything from cute romance, to clever jokes, to out-of-control monster chaos. In the beginning, that's what the movie seems to focus on the most is the chaos. Monsters running around, limbs falling off (zombies), other monsters getting squished by a blob monster, and so on. I think it's merely a showcase for all the monsters featured in the movie as well as entertainment for the younger audience. Even though most of the chaotic, slap-stick comedy throughout the movie is typical, it still appeals to the younger kids. As for the clever jokes and one-liners, I wish there were more of those. There were a couple of small spoofs and references in the movie that had me laughing, although I won't say what for spoiler reasons. The humor is widely ranged in this movie; with a lot of the jokes being repetitive, I think it weighs down the movie a little bit. It still contains plenty of charm that is unique, but it's just not that memorable. The kind of music that is used towards the end of the movie is annoying because it is basically techno/pop music you hear on the mainstream radio stations, and although the younger kids might enjoy it because that is what they are growing up listening to; I think they should have used music that is more classic and appealing to general audiences. In summary, we have a decent animated movie here, but it contains many elements that we have seen more than once before in past, similar movies.",6.0,jpajs14,2012/12/07,6,3
1412,The Fault in Our Stars,Too many people are idiots.,"I give it ""1"" because IMDb doesn't let me give it 0. I never wrote a review before, but seeing the average of 8.5 gave me a feeling of never being able to trust IMDb again. I usually check movie scores in IMDb to decide if I should watch it in the theaters. Below 7 is lame (except for comedies which gets lower scores). 7 to 8 maybe. 8 and up must see (except for this movie). Seeing an 8.5 I went to the theater excited. I hope someone like me is out there and reads this review before he wastes his time and money with it. What I saw: Boring, depressing, cynic, pessimist, average looking to slightly good looking girl has lung cancer. The audience is led to believe she is smart because she read the same book 1000 times over (doing that isn't smart) and goes to college (which she doesn't really). She goes to a support group where good hearted, Christian, cancer survivor (which is made to look like a loser) helps young people who have cancer. There, she meets 2 characters: 1) eye cancer guy who is going to have to remove them and has a huge boobed (to good for him) girlfriend, who will leave him 10 minutes later. 2) his friend, an extremely athletic, pretty, extremely confident guy (even though he's a virgin (yeah right *rolls eyes*)) who is also a cancer survivor (lost a leg to it, but is paradoxically still very athletic). Even though his value on the meat market is much higher than the protagonist girl's value, he only has eyes for her, even without her saying anything but depressing things. At the end of the meeting, if being athletic, pretty and confident isn't enough, a girl passes by him trying to get his attention (to show that even other girls are into him), so that the main girl can be certain that he's an alpha male, but she still give's him a hard time (because in every romantic movie a guy has to prove himself even beyond the shadow of a doubt that he's the man for a boring girl (the exception is when there are 2 awesome guys fighting for the same girl (Twilight))). They start talking on the phone and she lends him her favorite book. The leg cancer guy says that her book is amazing. And since the spoiled brat cancer girl has some stupid question she wants to make to the author, he decides to get them both a trip to Europe to talk to the writer of the book. He could get anything for himself, but he decides to give his special once in a lifetime cancer wish to her, even though they are not boyfriend/girlfriend, they have not had sex, they haven't even kissed yet. Her doctor is the ugliest actor, so you know he's going to be the bad guy. He tells her that she can't take the trip in any possible way! She goes anyway (obviously). In the generic romantic European country, the guy decides to use a tux (which all men love to wear... Not!) to take her to a very expensive dinner (which although he doesn't end up having to pay, he was more than happy to be able to pay for her!). The author seems to be a reasonable guy, he tells them in other words that the book ended the way it should have ended, that her questions are stupid and that she's a spoiled brat/ narcissist (which is all true). She gets sad, boy comforts her and tells her he could write a better ending then the author (no he couldn't, and if that's the case, why couldn't she? and why did they come in the first place?), they decide to go to Anne Frank's house. She's tired of going upstairs because of her lung cancer. When she's at the place where Anne Frank hid, she kisses the boy. Other tourists who were there clap for the blatant disrespect of Anne's suffering because they're Nazis(it's the only reasonable explanation). This clapping cheers them on to having sex. At this point me and my girlfriend were discussing going out of the theater before the end, because it was so bad and cliché, but we stayed, just in case the end was amazing to make up for all this bulls... They go back to America. Guy has cancer again and becomes depressed (He knew it before going to Europe, but only gets depressed about it now, w t f?!). In his depression he stops talking to girl (because romantic movies need a moment of sad separation which can always be easily resolved after some days by talking). He starts talking to girl again... about death. Girl writes eulogy for boy, and reads it to him. Boy dies, it's time for her to read eulogy (I'm thinking: she's obviously not going to read the same thing again, because that would be boring for the audience of the movie) and then she doesn't read it! (what?! who saw that coming except for everyone!?). She decides to say bland feel good lies in his funeral, instead of the truth, because she's a conformist narcissist coward. Girl gets a paper that leg cancer boy wrote to her before he died. I barely remember, but it's some romantic BS. The end. There's also a scene I don't remember exactly when in the movie that shows how deep does narcissism goes in the girl: She says that she knows that when she dies, her parents are not going to be able to do anything anymore, shrivel and die, because she's dead. Her parents are like: No, we aren't. Get over yourself. Highlight of the movie: Another guy plays violin for a short bit of time.",1.0,o_oraculo,2014/06/14,607,295
1413,Crash,Crash...your head into a wall after seeing this. You'll feel better.,"Wow...what a load of... My husband, to my shame, purchased the DVD based on the hype and all the Oscar hoopla. I read a few reviews before hand, and was wary. Still, I really wanted to like this movie. As I watched it, it became really hard to do. I tried on a cinematic, technical level, looking for great camera work, settings, lighting...nope, nothing impressed me. I tried to like it for its proposed ""edgy"" dialog, and its ""daring"", ""noble"", ""eye-opening"" coverage of racism. None of that came across in the movie. It was written almost from the perspective of someone who hasn't experienced tense situations, let alone racism. Matt Dillon, Don Cheadle, and Terrance Howard did the best they could with their roles. However, ANYONE could have played any of the characters, and it would have been the same movie. The music was forgettable. The story is mostly an urban folk tale, but there is no urban-styled music. The music is too clean. Overall, the movie was mostly a ""C"" movie, not at all worthy of the awards it received. There is maybe only one truly intense scene...but it is really a cliché in disguise. Just like the rest of the film. If you have to, absolutely have to watch this, rent it. Or wait for Crash: The Musical. As an aside: The jacket of the DVD has a picture of Jennifer Esposito on the back...SHE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE STORY. Her character was non-existent, accept for seeing her under Don Cheadle for two seconds. If they were going to put a screen shot of Esposito on the DVD jacket, they could have mentioned Sandra Bullock's collagen bloated upper lip in the end credit thank-you's, since both Esposito and the lip served the same purpose, whatever purpose that was.",3.0,alias_fate,2006/03/23,30,19
1414,Ferris Bueller's Day Off,I did not care for this cult hit.,"Ferris Bueller's Day Off-*-Worthless- Directed by: John Hughes. Written by: John Hughes, Starring: Matthew Broderick, Alan Ruck, Mia Sara, Jeffery Jones, Jennifer Grey, Cindy Pickett, Lyman Ward, Edie McClurg, Charlie Sheen, Ben Stein, Del Close, Virginia Capers, Louis Anderson, Max Perlich, T. Scott Coffey, Kristy Swanson. Pointless and irreverent comedy with Broderick as a cool as ice teen who ditches school with his best buddy (Ruck) and his girlfriend (Sara) but must avoid the angry principal (Jones) and every adult who tries to destroy their plans but miraculously fails. John Hughes is artificial in his storytelling because there is nothing truthful to say about teenagers. To him, there are two groups of teenagers, those that are unharmed and those that are harmed. By this, I mean Bueller as the unharmed and every other teenager out there as the harmed. Bueller is perfect in every sense of the word and I do not understand how a filmmaker fixated on the destabilization of the teenager could create a protagonist so devoid of conflict. Ruck's character is Hughes's attempt at realism if only Ruck had played the part a bit better in terms of conflict. Yet Ruck did what he could, the character's emotions come out toward the end and without any warnings, which is Hughes's signature uneven qualities. In the film, kids are great and all adults are morons, which is more nihilism than counterculture. It's silly and goes on without much of a point besides tips and tricks to an unrealistic day of fun grounded by a director who does not know how to keep the elements of his story together.",1.0,MovieGuy109,2011/09/01,98,49
1415,Goodfellas,De Niro at his very best,"One of the best films ever made in every aspect. Very difficult to criticise, it truly is a gem for all gangster film lovers. Robert De Niro was masterful not even Pacino,Brando,Nicholson could have portrayed the character of Jimmy Conway as well in my opinion. The intensity and just utter brilliance that De Niro's ability brings to the character dose not allow you to look away from him. Few actors have that ability in my opinion, Brando and Pacino are two who do and who would have struggled to match De Niro. De Niro was supported well to say the least with great performances by Joe Pesci, Ray Liotta and Paul Sorvino. Every time you watch this film you see something different and it reminds you that this film is a masterpiece. Martin Scorsese had truly excelled himself in this film, he's created a benchmark for all future gangster films and to this day nothing has come moderately close. it amazes me how this film never won Best Picture at the Oscars.",10.0,johncaldwell4,2006/10/20,14,9
1416,Interstellar,To the stars - away from the common sense!,"This year is not very good for the sci-fi cinematography. Besides multiple unintentional parodies of the genre (like X-Men: Days of Future Past), there was actually only one big-budget movie worth watching: On the Edge of Tomorrow. It seems like Tom Cruise is one of the few Hollywood stars able to wisely pick roles. His recent achievements leave little to desire: Valkyrie, or Knight and Day are good at worst, with the high pitch of Oblivion. Are we able to say the same about Matthew McConaughey? Unfortunately, not. Although his recent movies are above average (True Detective or Dallas Buyers Club), the latest picture he plays in, Interstellar (directed by Christopher Nolan and written by him and his brother), is a huge letdown and misunderstanding. I don't think anyone being fond of ""hard"" science-fiction stories will like it. Here is why. Firstly, the story. It is in general similar to Mission to Mars or The Red Planet, where the handful of daredevils are put in the spaceship to venture on a mission, which result will impact the whole human race. Unfortunately, which is the usual problem in this case, the whole plot is neither engaging, nor entertaining. We have a bunch of uninteresting people making uninteresting things in space. Maybe because of the long time span of the picture, the viewer quickly gets bored and does not care about the main characters. Besides, the space adventure is mixed with the very personal story of the father trying to save his children (which is also a time-consuming thread here). Anyway, the main conclusion of Interstellar is the banal statement that ""love is the most important thing in the world"". Do we really need to sit for almost three hours in the cinema to get this? By coincidence, the second problem is the length of the movie. Currently, when the the picture is recorded not on the tape, but in the digital medium, every director tries to surpass his rivals by creating as long movie as possible. Maybe it is supposed to be the emblem of his might, skills or wisdom? I have no idea, but the fact is that the contemporary blockbusters are difficult to watch especially because they last for three or more hours, having the plot for only half of this time. This is exactly the case with Interstellar. The presented story is far from complex, and could easily fit in two hours. In fact, the first forty minutes of the movie have nothing to do with the rest of the story and could be recapitulated by the narrator in two sentences... This film tries to treat the topic of interstellar travel seriously. Unfortunately, some ideas are presented according to our current knowledge of physics and astronomy, while others are just stupid. This mixture makes the suspension of disbelief, necessary to enjoy such movie, impossible to attain. On one side we have wormholes, black holes, higher dimensions of space and the silence of the void. On the other hand, there is totally unconvincing reality of the XXI century, where farmers are more valuable than engineers (guys, really?) and tomography is (mysteriously) gone. In one scene the physicist explains convincingly the work regime of the wormhole (by the way, this scene is IDENTICAL to the one from the far better Event Horizon). In another, we see the mission robot TARS, being the member of the crew. I know that humanoid machines from fifties seem ridiculous today (like the one from The Day The Earth Stood Still), but they are really the top quality idea compared to the robots depicted in Interstellar. It is difficult to believe someone created such a model and the whole crew agreed to put it the picture! It's almost like the the wooden planet from the initial script of Alien 3... The number of errors and non-logical events is just amazing. Anyone complaining about the lack of consistency in Prometheus (which was also much better than this one) will have the real hunting ground here. In fact, the more time passes after seeing the movie, the more nonsenses are detected. Don't think about this too much, anyway, its not worthy... The Nolan brothers used their imagination a little bit too much in the final part of the story, where the word ""magic"" (interchangeable with ""nonsense"") comes to mind. As the result, the viewer is left at the end indifferent to what is presented on the screen and does not care about the fate of the characters... Please recall the infamous Black Hole, and You will have the impression of what is going on here... The music is of course the extremely important part of every picture. If the composer knows his craft, the soundtrack complements the images, creating the flawless combo (as was in Terminator, Starship Troopers, Aliens, etc.). Here we have the attempt to create the epic atmosphere, but the events shown on screen are rather uninteresting, therefore the resulting impression is just the overwhelming noise, making the viewer angry instead of touching or moving him. Unfortunately, it seems like making a good movie about the interstellar travel is extremely difficult. People like to go to the movies and see a good story. There are multiple requirements for the entertaining movie: the mystery, the convincing scenery, the real characters we could care about, finally, the emotional strain, often related to the dangers our protagonists are exposed to. Interstellar does not offer anything of these. It is a long and boring sermon about the future of Mankind in the universe, pretending to be the science-fiction movie. With this picture Christopher Nolan proved his only memorable work was Prestige and the Batman trilogy was not the accident, but the clear sign that his main achievements in Hollywood will be too long, boring and utterly disappointing pictures, initially rising hopes for a good time spent in the cinema, but leaving in a complete, sad disillusion after all.",1.0,foxtrot-21,2014/11/09,1158,509
1417,Intermission,Wonderful Irish movie,"I saw this over the weekend and I really liked it. Beautifully Irish. Especially after the a bit slow beginning when the paths of the characters started getting bind together more closely. The movie was very fresh and in some way realistically rough. Not too smooth like many Hollywood movies are. Colin Farrell was a brilliant bad guy, Shirley Henderson a touching young girl with an excess growth of facial hair, Cillian Murphy and David Wilmont friends with problems with women, and life in general. The other characters were also very real and it was easy to believe in them. The ending was beautiful and crowned with an old Clash classic ""I fought the law"" sung by Colin Farrell.",8.0,cinna665,2004/03/15,5,0
1418,Ferris Bueller's Day Off,"A charismatic teenager risks it all for one more ""sick"" day.","When this came out in 1986, I had no intention of seeing it. There had been too many movies about bratty teenagers for my taste, and there seemed to be no reason to devote a couple of hours to it. Flash forward about ten years, and I finally saw it on one of the premium cable channels. Long story short, at the age of 52, I fell in love with it. I can't count the number of times I've seen it since, and I look forward to enjoying it again. I am particularly fond of Jennifer Grey's work in this; I haven't seen her since in anything that shows her talent as well. (P. S. Of course I own a copy too.)

1419,Ferris Bueller's Day Off,"I felt sorry for Ferris' friend, not Ferris","'Ferris Bueller's Day Off' is one of the classic comedies to come out of the 1980s. It's acquired a following of its own over the years, partly because it is quite easy to relate to it. In summary, the film is about Ferris and his friends, a female he has a crush on and his geeky male friend. Ferris is determined to get a day off of school, and this day is filled with events and plenty of mistakes and some comedy. Some of it is at the expense of his poor geeky friend, who I felt immensely sorry for because he was forced to follow an over-bearing Ferris and ended up with a big problem on his hands. Despite the comedy geared at the adult authority figures (who do not understand the youth), the film really did not make a lot of sense or provide a good story or conclusion. Right, Ferris gets his way and the principal makes a fool of himself and faces the consequences; this is a typical teen rebellion film. It's a classic comedy, but in terms of a good story, Ferris Bueller falls short. And, you either enjoy this type of comedy or you don't enjoy it. If you don't enjoy it, then you will not enjoy the film. Simple as that. Personally, while I thought that some of the humor was good, I felt that it could not carry the story for me, and I felt more sorry for some of the characters and did not feel sorry for the main character at all. And, if you cannot stand the main character, then, well, it is difficult to enjoy the film.",5.0,rebeljenn,2005/11/22,26,12

I thought this one was at the same level as the first one. I had fun watching it. Almost all the actors made me laugh, sometimes more sometimes less. Some characters are less humorous in their role, because the character is just stupid, but nevertheless this movie is fun to watch. I think all the actors are great in this movie, and the story might not be the best story ever but I was not expecting a great story anyway when it's a laid back comedy.

You will find yourself humming the haunting songs for days afterwards. Some people find the prospect of watching foreign films daunting as sometimes the subtitles distract from the narrative. All I can say is that if they bother you that much, switch them off and listen to the wonderful French dialogue, I guarantee you will still be able to follow most of story. Jugnot is fantastic as the hapless music teacher and the children well deserve the Oscar nominations for their touching portrayal of misunderstood bad boys. This film has some genuine comedy moments and will definitely tug on the old heart strings. It's not very often that a film this inspiring comes along.

Postmodern but not overly pretentious and highly relatable I felt I watched it at just the right time personally as I can fully understand all the jokes and the characters situations. It's bold and ambitious in a way not too dissimilar to Home Alone and those high stakes usually result in some hilarious jokes. Packing in exceptional word play and other smaller scale physical jokes there's so much on offer here to laugh at as well as a serious and emotional ""subplot"" of sorts.

1423,Ferris Bueller's Day Off,Rather overrated,"I've always thought this movie would have worked better if the Ferris Bueller character was less of an inconsiderate dick. I mean: this is the protagonist you're supposed to root for here, was it so difficult to give him some more redeeming qualities or something? Sure, he's supposed to be a Mahoney-like rebel that fights the system and whatnot, but is the system in this movie really that awful? Oh no, Rooney checks if Ferris is ditching school! That's his job of course, but how dare he actually do it? Apart from that, the movie is just a typical John Hughes film, coming of age and such and such. There are some laughs here and there, but mostly it's about teens trying to cope with growing up. This is done a bit better in ""The Breakfast Club"" though, that movie has more compelling characters. This one focuses a lot on a rather whiny Alan Ruck, too much I'd say. I do love the tertiary role for Charlie Sheen though, that was classic. Overall I never really felt the full appeal of this movie, though it isn't really bad either.",6.0,Sandcooler,2011/05/23,10,5

Two terrific Scottish actresses Shirley Henderson and Kelly McDonald do passable Dublin accents and some seldom seen, excellent Irish actresses Ruth McCabe and Deirdre O'Kane in some of the 12 or 13 leading roles. Broadway and ""Million Dollar Baby"" actor Brian O'Byrne has a particularly funny part as the unfortunate bus-driver. Highly recommended.",8.0,hanrahanpm,2005/02/07,11,4

1426,Moon,Existential dirty dishes on the Moon,"I liked it. The piano music played throughout kept the tone of the movie from becoming too sterile, lonely. This movie displays some dull life on the moon. The piano music will pull your heart strings alittle, keeping you in there. The moon scenes are very realistic looking. Although I was dead tired and sleepy, I didn't go to sleep during the movie! Now that is saying something for me! I feel that this is a classic movie. It attempts to touch man's identity, how we determine our worth. Are we what we do? Are we what we join? Are we our family? Are we illegal immigrants if we work on the Moon and then return to Earth? I didn't expect a science related movie to touch on existential subject matter. This movie will make you think about your family. It will make you think about how you put together your identity. No, it isn't merely a movie with crash bang action and explosions on the Moon. This isn't an action movie. It's a movie for thinkers.. This movie is edited tightly. There is only one scene where there is some happiness. I suppose you could compare it to a movie about a lonely soldier in WWII who only has a few days to go before the end of his war time assignment. But because it is sci fi, and realistic, you have more to consider: The subject of human cloning comes up. The issue of ""where is home""? ...is another matter to contend with. And even more, you must think about a business establishment's loyalty to its workers as an issue. I haven't given you the answers here so that you will see the movie.

Also, there's no ""mafia"" or ""families"" really to speak of. And a majority of the characters are Irish, not Italian. I liked all the different characters involved, the wiseguys, the losers, the brutes, the smart AND dumb people, you name it. The fighting/shooting/heist scenes were perfectly executed (no pun intended). Ray Liotta is great as Henry Hill, he explains everything so well and makes ""the life"" look great. Robert DeNiro really proved himself once again in the part of Jimmy Conway. And Joe Pesci was perfect to play Tommy DeVito. All the supporting/side characters were great as well.

I also don't appreciate a movie that wag's it's finger in my face, yeah, i get it, it's about race and inter-connection and all of that, but the film was way too obvious.

1435,Death of a Salesman,So extreme and so fascinating,"I will not insist on the plot which is so well-known that to ignore it is a proof of incompetent a-social behavior. I will insist here on the performance of Dustin Hoffman, hence on the particular rendition of this play that is kept as a play with real sound stages like in the old days of the thirties or forties. Dustin Hoffman makes this Willy Loman a lot worse than I was used to read it. He is shown, and as soon as his prime, at least, when his sons are in high school, some seventeen years before, he is shown was I saying as a completely paranoid and deranged person. Not deranged because of some kind of gene. But deranged because first of all he got and kept a job even when he was failing, though he was not done for that job. A salesman has to be a born hypocrite and has to be a conqueror: any argument is good provided it brings in the proper signature. So he is rather misplaced and his derangement comes from that misplacement. What's more he was discovered in his total hypocrisy, though in no way commercial and hence unacceptable from the salesmanship point of view since this woman was bringing him nothing but was costing him a lot, by his own son who was coming after him to get the help he needed, but a help that could only be effective if it were based on the truth, truthfulness, confidence, trust. And Willy Loman was lower than low at that moment. It threw his son into some totally absurd and paranoid a-social attitude, a derangement of its own due to the misplacement of his trust in his own father. When that trust was placed back where it belonged, that is to say in the trashcan, the son only had his eyes to cry, his fingers to steal, his flesh to suffer, in prison if necessary. This film pushes the character of Willy Loman slightly too far and his derangement explains then his suicide: he completely lost control of himself. But I would assert the idea that this is not true of that character who in fact commits suicide when he discovers and finally understands that he had not forgotten that silly episode of his son discovering him in the cradle of the revolution with another woman than his mother. I would like to believe that this last act in his life is not the result of his derangement but of his last flash of guilt for having failed and cheated so many people, in a word a suicide of divine justice coming from the last flash of consciousness of that man who might have been able to be anything but a loser. Even if I disagree with the vision of Schlondorff, I must say the rendering of the character, the acting of the actor and at times the overbearing-ness of the over-acting of the actor is absolutely remarkable and logical and of one piece from beginning to end. That man is not old. That man is not worn out. That man is not vain. That man is not a perambulating lie. That man is sick in his head, crazy, deranged to the extreme point of insanity and thus extremely dangerous since he projects his hatred of that unbearable situation onto everyone around him, even, and particularly, those who love him.

CRASH is a ""well intentioned"" film and I suspect the IMDb reader base that is praising it does so because of the script's attempts to try and reveal that there is more beneath the surface of human's apparent prejudice. Unfortunately, as a critic for the New York Times explained it, this film shows that there is only the absolute opposite. The characters in this film have no subtlety and no range of human emotions. There isn't a single real character in this movie, only contrivances that are constructed around a writer's technical skill at creating unsupported ironic events (as we see so many times when the introductory actions of a character become their opposite). The movie, basically, has neither a sense or reality nor a skillful sense of artifice. It is, ultimately, a mess with good production values. While I would normally just dismiss it and not write a comment, I am somewhat frightened by the number of rave reviews that this film is receiving in IMDb. I can't understand this.

While the three principals' chemistry keeps the bond of idiocy intact the screenplay by Sean Anders, John Morris & Jonathan M. Goldstein & John Francis Daley meanders more into easy-for-laughs vulgarity than any other point of being made comedy with by-the-numbers direction by Anders. Aniston has a field day as her over-sexed boss from hell and Foxx add a bit more flava than the first film. Frequently funny but one big mess altogether.",7.0,george.schmidt,2014/12/28,8,4
1439,Taxi Driver,A Descent Into Madness,"""Taxi Driver"" starts off with a beautiful and perfectly fitting score from composer, Bernard Hermann, as we see the blurred city of New York as the fast paced lights from cars and signs are distorted and put into slow motion. ""Taxi Driver"" is one of Martin Scorsese' finest achievements as he teams up with Robert De Niro. Travis Bickle (De Niro) is the title character. The acting as a whole is exceptional. Harvey Keitel has an extremely small part as a pimp named Sport, and he brings a forgettable character to center stage. Keitel is so good in this you wish you would get to see more from his character. Jodie Foster plays the prostitute under Sports rule. Iris, is 12 years old, and for a 14 year old actress (at the time), Foster deals with some heavy and extremely adult material, and she handles it incredibly well. Keitel and Foster have a scene together where Sport holds her and slowly dances with her as he whispers into her ear about how lucky he is to have a woman like her. It's an utterly repulsive scene. The look on his face mixed with the calm and safe look on the face of Iris, is pretty disgusting. It's extremely well acted even though it's a pretty quick and minor scene. In this one scene we see the type of control Sport has over the young, impressionable child that he abuses and takes advantage of. These are the kinds of things that set Travis Bickle off. The film is a classic that dissects the fallout of one mans loneliness and his thirst for acceptance, recognition and notice. The editing is very good, the direction is great, but it's carried by a magnificent script from Paul Schrader and a great lead performance. This probably stands as De Niro's second best work to ""Raging Bull,"" and among the finest acting performances of all time. Travis Bickle is the self proclaimed, ""God's lonely man."" Bickle walks amongst the people on the filthy, crowded streets of New York City. Wherever he goes, he goes unnoticed; like a ghost meandering through life's morbid boredom of repetitiveness as each day endlessly runs into the next. Bickle suffers from an inability to sleep so he goes to the porno theaters after 12 hour shifts. His mind is constantly racing as he takes various forms of pills and abuses alcohol. The former Vietnam Veteran has a damaged psyche that continues to get worse and worse as the disgust for the lowlifes of New York eat away at his consciences. The first act of the films starts with a normal looking man, with a regular hair cut and regular job in an irregular city. We watch Bickle go through everyday routines and his work habit is the main focus to derive attention away from his bloodlust. We don't see much wrong with him other than some signs of frustration and restlessness. He decides that his body needs some fine tuning as he reverts back to his days as a Marine. He meets up with a gun dealer and buys three pistols and a .44 magnum. He's ready for war, and the table is set. The ending of the film is controversial for its vagueness and its inability to state a clear purpose of reality or fantasy. The film strongly suggests a dream-like state as we watch with a long running overhead shot (possibly signifying Bickle's departure from the world?) of the carnage left in Bickle's wake. Then there's the music of a dream inducing state at the end of the scene, which is the strongest hint towards a dream like state. What we do know is that Travis Bickle takes the lives of lowlifes, degenerates, and the scum of the earth. He's treated as the hero and glorified by the media for his actions. This is a slap in the face to the media for finding that a vigilante did the right thing because it was for a good cause: Kill 5 scumbags, save 1. The final scene of the film is also controversial. We see Betsy for the first time since their big fight and she's no longer disgusted with Travis. Now the media has changed her opinion of him too. Travis has reverted back to the same look he spouted in the first act of the film. He's quiet, reserved and humble. He looks harmless. As the ride home goes along we find out that Palantine has won the nomination. After, Travis drops Betsy off, he leaves without taking her money and with a smile on his face he gives her a simple, ""So long."" As Travis drives off, he menacingly looks back into the mirror, representing a problem still exists, then we fade back to the start of the film. With the symbolic scenes throughout the film depicting Bickle's brooding, boiling, rage within; symbolizing the fact that nothing has changed. The near death experience doesn't cure him. The accolades from the media and the recognition from everyday people doesn't make it any better. He's still ready for war.",9.0,DaveDiggler,2008/06/25,112,88

1441,Crash,So awful - it's embarrassing! Der!,"After hearing so many great reviews, I was really looking forward to watching Crash last night. I had heard that it was unflinchingly real, thought-provoking, and bold. It was indeed thought-provoking--all throughout the movie, I kept wondering how in the world can such a horribly pretentious, unrealistic movie get so many raves? One review, which I wholeheartedly agree with, comes from Peter Debruge of the Miami Herald. He writes ""Contrived, obvious and overstated, Crash is basically just one white man's righteous attempt to make other white people feel as if they've confronted the problem of racism head-on."" This was exactly how I felt while watching this movie. The characters were predictable one-trick ponies, the dialogue was preachy and unrealistic, the situations and coincidences were preposterous. It seems like it was written by a man whose only experience with racism comes from what he's read in books and seen on TV. He has very little in touch with reality! Everything had an air of melodrama and it felt as if I were watching a theatrical production (a poorly produced one, at that). For a movie about racism and stereotypes, most of its main characters and situations were stereotypes themselves! I found myself saying ""Der!!"" out loud so many times. Most of the actors, for what they have to work with, are pretty good, and there are a couple of scenes that caught my attention and didn't induce involuntary eye-rolling. But as a woman of color living in Los Angeles, and having watched this with my best friend (a white male), we both agree that this movie really hasn't got a clue as to what the real world is actually like. It's like a book-smart kid who thinks he can get street smart by reading and watching movies and television--it just doesn't work.",1.0,sugarspheres,2005/09/09,273,140
1442,October Sky,This is an excellent movie,"There is a bit of trivia which should be pointed out about a scene early in the movie where Homer watches the attempt of December 6, 1957 (at least that was the video used on the TV he was watching) which showed the Vangard launch attempt, which failed. He is next shown reading or dictating a letter to Dr. Von Braun offering condolences about the failure. Von Braun was at Marshall space flight center in Huntsville working for the Army. The Vanguard project was by the early Nasa team which was at what soon became Goddard Space flight center. The army rushed the Jupiter-C, which was essentially a US made V2 technology, but worked to launch a satellite in response to Russia's success with Sputnik. This error may have actually been made by Homer, because of the notoriety of Von Braun, but his team didn't have their attempt fail. In fact the underlying Redstone was flying from 52 and was the first US man rated booster, used for Shepard's sub orbital flight, as well as Grissom's. This is why this sort of movie is so good, as it hopefully will inspire people to read up and spot these bits of trivia, and in the process see what has been done, and be inspired to do more.",9.0,jwstephens,2007/02/14,8,7
1443,Pulp Fiction,The rebirth of a genre – and film history,"I can only speak for myself, but I had never seen anything as stylish, cleverly constructed, well written and electrifying as this milestone when I first saw it in 1994. What really pulled me in right from the start is what we've now come to know as a Tarantino trademark: the dialogue. When gangsters Jules and Vincent talk to each other (or all the other characters, for that matter) there is a natural flow, a sense of realism and yet something slightly over the top and very theatrical about their lines – it's a mixture that immediately grabs your attention (even if it's just two dudes talking about what kind of hamburger they prefer, or contemplating the value of a foot-massage). Then there's the music: the songs Tarantino chose for his masterpiece fit their respective scenes so perfectly that most of those pieces of music are now immediately associated with 'Pulp Fiction'. And the narrative: the different story lines that come together, the elegantly used flashbacks, the use of ""chapters"" – there is so much playful creativity at play here, it's just a pure joy to watch. If you're a bit of a film geek, you realize how much knowledge about film and love for the work of other greats – and inspiration from them - went into this (Leone, DePalma, Scorsese and, of course, dozens of hyper-stylized Asian gangster flicks), but to those accusing Tarantino of copying or even ""stealing"" from other film-makers I can only say: There has never been an artist who adored his kind of art that was NOT inspired or influenced by his favorite artists. And if you watch Tarantino's masterpiece today, it's impossible not to recognize just what a breath of fresh air it was (still is, actually). Somehow, movies - especially gangster films - never looked quite the same after 'Pulp Fiction'. Probably the most influential film of the last 20 years, it's got simply everything: amazing performances (especially Sam Jackson); it features some of the most sizzling, iconic dialogue ever written; it has arguably one of the best non-original soundtracks ever - it's such a crazy, cool, inspirational ride that you feel dizzy after watching it for the first time. It's – well: it's 'Pulp Fiction'. 10 stars out of 10. Favorite films: [URL] Lesser-known Masterpieces: [URL] Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: [URL]",10.0,gogoschka-1,2014/07/24,324,258
1444,Intermission,Superb film with brilliant characters,This was a thoroughly enjoyable film. An independent enterprise making the best use of Irelands talent. The character definitions are just enough to add depth to the film but the whole project is humorous and enjoyable. Took me a bit of time to get used to the accents but I thoroughly enjoyed this film. You don't need in-depth characterisations. This film achieves what is sets out to achieve...a funny look into the lives of a dissimilar group of people who are all linked by current circumstance. Superb dialogue and a quirky script. I recommend that you get this film as long as you enjoy quirky humour. Enjoy the film for what it is and don't try to read more into it.,10.0,northernfella,2004/05/22,5,0
1445,Death of a Salesman,Some of the best acting you will ever see,"This is a truly outstanding perfomance of what may be the most important american play ever written. Hoffman and Malkovich seem to become the characters they play in what may be their greatest performances. This is an incredible drama that can be interpreted many ways... it's subtle and powerfull. Death of a salesman is about a man's realization that he isn't living the american dream he once thought he was. It's about self-deception. It's about trying to keep up with the Jones's. It's about pursuing your dreams, or regretting that you didn't. The plot is nothing special because it's simply a device that Mailer uses to explore these themes.",10.0,bernarde,1999/12/13,23,16
1446,The Fault in Our Stars,I've Saved my Ten for This Film,"Before I continue with this review, please note that I have not read the book, but am going to in the very near future :) Please note that Im also a (straight) guy... not that it matters :P Wow what can I say about this movie. From the moment the title sequence starts, I was hooked straight away. Scene to scene this movie just manages to suck me into this beautiful world of Hazel Grace Lancaster and Augustus Waters. The chemistry between Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elsort is astounding and the performances were astonishing. Honestly, this is the best movie I have seen all year, even better than Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Godzilla which was a massive surprise. I just thought this was going to be another teenie love story and boy was I wrong. I loved this movie and recommend it to everyone across all ages. I'm rambling on and praising the movie now so I should probably get on with the review. The direction and cinematography was fantastic. Not a single shot felt odd or out of place. Every shot matched the scene and felt real. The editing was also great as shot after shot matched with the characters faces and where they were (typical good movie editing stuff). The acting perhaps was one of the best aspects of this movie. Seriously it makes the two characters feel real and alive, and at times I forgot this was fiction and not based on a true story. Their performances were so heartfelt and definitely Oscar worthy in my opinion. But knowing the academy this is just another teenie love story that will not be acknowledged at all. Hopefully I'm wrong, but thats the way it normally is. This is the first movie this year that I have given a 10. I don't give out 10's easily, but there was seriously nothing wrong with this film. The pacing was perfect, the acting was phenomenal, the direction, editing and cinematography was exceptional and overall, this movie is one of the best romantic comedies that have ever touched the face of the earth. I encourage EVERYONE to go see this movie no matter what age you are and bring a packet of tissues as well. You'll need it. 10/10",8.0,itsjoshykho,2014/06/04,555,384
1447,The Chorus,"Beautiful, heartwarming","This film is a rarity on several counts. First, a French film that doesn't leave one depressed, that is rare enough. Second, a sentimental and touching film that doesn't descend into mawkishness or maudlin territory. And third, a simple and predictable plot that still holds your attention because of the charm of the characters. The story is set in post-WW 2 France, with destitute and/or orphaned boys in a harshly run boarding school. There's the usual sadistic headmaster, but the other teachers are far more human. (I wish we had seen more of these teachers, they would have added a great other dimension, and the movie is short enough.) The new ""prefect"" (teaches the kids but also chaperones them in their sleeping quarters) earns the trust and respect of these otherwise troublesome urchins by showing kindness. A musician himself, he finds that he can give them a positive outlet for their energies by forming a choir, at the same time finding an avenue for performing his own compositions. While simple and not very original, the pleasure of this movie is in the execution. The prefect and the various other characters are quite real and multi-dimensional; the bad ones have good qualities, and vice-versa as well. You really sense the despair of being imprisoned in that school for months and years, and the sense of futility which overcomes the staff. The music is haunting and beautiful, including the score and also the choral pieces practiced/performed by the boys. The ending is mostly satisfying, though not all the threads are tied up in the way one expects. The retrospective way of telling the story also adds some interest and poignancy, when you realize who those people were in the first opening scenes. Very strongly recommended and, except for a few vulgarities (which are probably a little less hard-edged in the English subtitles), an excellent family film.",8.0,dbogosian-1,2009/01/18,1,1

1449,Intermission,What Happens After The Intermission?,"Director John Crowley and writer Mark O'Rowe create a fascinating and hilarious black comedy farce. 'Intermission', what an interesting name for a film. The title itself caught my attention. It's set in a small Irish town and focuses on its working class characters. Overlapping stories aren't anything new in film but here it is done exceptionally well. As the story builds, the connection between each character is gradually (and subtly) revealed and it feels very natural. Despite a few characters that border on being criminally insane, most of the characters are the common man and woman from various walks of life, people you see everyday who want love and respect. 'Intermission' is full of energy. The action sequences are shot wonderfully, especially the final chase sequence. The writing is just solid and it has a wicked sense of humour that works excellently. Dialogues are witty and very funny. The score is quite unique. Of the cast, Colin Farrell, Kelly MacDonald, Cillian Murphy, Colm Meaney and Brían F. O'Byrne are already well known internationally. They perform naturally and do nothing short of a superb job as do their costars Shirley Henderson and Ger Ryan. 'Intermission's already become a favourite. I would easily recommend it to anyone (especially those who love black comedy) who's interested in witnessing a different kind of slice of life with an extra dose of adrenaline.",,Chrysanthepop,2012/03/13,0,0

1454,Interstellar,beautiful journey,"One of the best sci-fi movies.First of all, it is incredibly beautiful to watch. Honestly, it was so beautiful that I felt like I was sucked into the movie. We can feel the talent of Christopher Nolan, just by looking at the way it is filmed. The techniques he used contribute to create that visual environment in a believable way. These two important parts (image and sound) create a stunning atmosphere. You will forget you are in a movie theater, and you will be lost in space, sucked into the adventures of this new Space Odyssey, begging for more. It is a truly unique experience. I can say that I have never felt something like that in a movie theater. Then, of course, the cast. First of all, Matthew McConaughey. I discovered this actor in Tropic Thunder, but he didn't really convince me, though he was quite funny. Then I saw Dallas Buyers Club. Since that movie, I love him. In this movie... Well, he is the movie. I exaggerate a bit, since there are other great actors (some even unexpected with a special guest) who play extremely well. But he is just what was needed to feel the human part of the story (which is very important in Interstellar). He is capable of making us feel so many different emotions all along the story, as a father, as a human. Anne Hathaway was very convincing, all together the actors managed to create some harmony, which makes the human interactions credible. Caine, Chastaing and Affleck are a perfect choice. And then there is... The special guest, I will call him ""X"". His role, which could be seen as a minor role, is actually much more important than that. He proves, once again, that he is a great actor. Watch and see. And finally, the scenario/story. I won't spoil anything here; I'll just try to convince you how great it is. Nolan is known to revolutionize everything when he tries a new genre in cinema. Well, once again he did it. With The Dark Knight he revolutionized the superhero genre. With Interstellar he's revolutionizing the sci-fi genre in cinema. From what I heard, he worked with a physicist (in gravitational physics and astrophysics) to help him with that movie. And we can feel and see it. During the fifties, Asimov laid the foundations of modern science fiction. Lucas and Kubrick did the same in cinema. Today, Nolan is laying the new foundations of the genre in cinema, proving that cinema is still at the beginning of what can be done (brace yourselves my friends, we have not seen anything yet). My rating for this movie can only be a 10, because in itself, it is a beginning for a new kind of cinema. It IS a classic. Those who say ""we can't compare this movie to 2001 Space Odyssey, nor can we compare Nolan to Kubrick"" are wrong. We can, and we should. Talented people don't live only in the past, some genius live today, among us. And Nolan is one of them. Many say that he is overrated. I truly don't think so. Only time will answer that. This is the sci-fi movie of the decade. Just go for it, without a second thought.",10.0,dhruvbehl24,2014/11/10,61,32
1455,Taxi Driver,You'll love the mood.. but is the ending worth 2 hours of build up?,"A nicely made dark and majestic experience, see the world through the eyes of a weird taxi driver, as his character progresses from a total embarrassment to a mad dog. The movie sends a clear message about society and human ego, and how a man's pride can drift him into insanity. The mood is nice, a prime example on a classic Noir movie, it builds up and prepares you mentally for the big ending.. an ending that failed to live up to the hype that the movie has built in you.. though it had a short yet exciting action scene the ending is pretty simple and is more about delivering a simple message rather than leaving you amazed or satisfied. The dark comedy in the movie is pretty clear, it shows you how messed up society really is, the movie was executed flawlessly when it comes to cinematic and production, but it will disappoint you at the very end, the ending was just too ""MEH"" to bear, especially after an excellent build of events preceding it, such a pity. I'm sure the movie was a big hit at the time of its release (after the Vietnam war), but I'm not sure it would be enjoyed the same at our current time, so let me put it this way: - If you enjoy a dark Noir mood with nice character development then watch it now. - If you enjoy movies with subliminal messages then add this one to your ""watch when I have nothing else to watch"" list. - If you're looking for a great story with a nice twist to it, I wouldn't recommend Taxi Driver.",6.0,energyzeezo,2017/04/17,178,121

I know that I am missing out by doing that but I have had some bad experiences, and like anything it scarred me. To be honest I bought this movie because Cillian Murphy is in it. After seeing him in Batman Begins and Red Eye I fell in love with him as an actor. I really enjoyed this movie. I would say that if you have trouble with accents this isn't for you. It is thick Irish the whole time. I had no problem with it and I think it has to do with the fact that where I live the people talk fast and thick too. Reading the other comment I do see how the humor is much different. I thought it was great. I chuckled through the whole movie. The movie moved along at a good speed and it never left you hanging.

1457,Ferris Bueller's Day Off,The McDonalds Hamburger of John Hughes films.,"Yep, it's popular- but is there any nutritional value? I think not. In one of his most successful teen movies, Hughes follows the unbearably cutesy antics of Ferris Beuller- well, I won't give away the plot such as it is. He ditches school, okay? But Matthew Broderick prances through the role as though Ferris were a queen waltzing through Chelsea, so full of himself that it's hard to watch and hard to turn away. Thankfully the supporting roles are actually real people. Alan Ruck and Jeffrey Jones provide great comedy based in reality, and the sound track is terrific. As Mr. Hughes films progress, either because he had more money to make them or because his taste improved- the music gets better and better. Actually, so does the film making.

1459,The Green Mile,Racist and predictable,"Frank Darabont's follow up to the Shawshank Redemption is a poorly written and painfully unoriginal story. For starters, the Noble Savage stereotype is racist at best. A character that is misunderstood by society and doesn't want to live in that society due to the character's extreme moral idealism (i.e. edward scissorhands, powder, etc.) is far from new. Coffey's character is not the only one that is one dimensional. Pretty much all the characters' dispositions are made to be one of two things: good or bad. There are no gray lines and it is obvious who the audience is supposed to hate and who they are supposed to root for. It's boring and childish. The frenchman, Michael Jeter, is made up so that we feel completely sorry for him. We're not even allowed to know what his crime was because then we might not love him so much. The prison guards are the most loving forgiving group of prison guards that have ever lived. Hell, they're the most loving forgiving people that ever lived. A prisoner spits in Tom Hanks's face and he actually does nothing about it? My grandmother isn't that nice. Stop reading here if you have not seen the movie. And wasn't it convenient that that prisoner, Sam Rockwell, just happened to be the actual criminal behind Coffey's crime? And when they ""caught"" Coffey with the girls, can anyone honestly say that if a black man was found with two dead white girls that they would not shoot him? Black men in the 30's, and especially in the South, would be killed for being seen in public with a white woman, much less killing a white child. And when Coffey does die, Tom Hanks doesn't put too much effort into stopping the execution. He just asks Coffey what he should do, and Coffey says nothing, so that's what he does. Of course Coffey must die, because in all racist Noble Savage films the savage must die so that his white savior can learn a valuable lesson. And where is the warden at this point? He said he can't stop the execution, but I find that implausible. I'm sure he could at least try to save the man who saved his wife. And wasn't that a plot twist that was hard to see coming? I also found it interesting that when Coffey healed her, he also did her hair and put makeup on her. The whole movie has no real continuity being that it was adopted from a serial novel. The movie could have ended in about five different places and the audience wouldn't have minded. The only interesting element of this movie is its ending which certainly does not save it. I suppose this movie is more Stephen King's fault than Darabont's, but regardless the movie is a disappointment in front the backdrop of all the superb movies that have been released with it in the past few months.",3.0,the coyote,2000/02/05,66,23
1460,Interstellar,Interbollo..s,"Interstellar by Christopher Nollan Reviewed by Svetoslav Grigorov First, I had to look at the score on [URL] to confirm that all the rumors were true (9 out of 10): me and Paul were the only ones who didn't like this movie and left 45 minutes before it had finished. Whatever that means I can assure you that I was/am still sober and I am not a zombie like the rest of the crowd in the Kettering Odeon cinema. Secondly, I would like to ask how all these critics made the comparison(s) with Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey and thirdly, please you who now read this review tell me that I am not the only one in my dullest disappointment for the year. Tell me that I haven't lost my marbles, tell me that you were enthralled from this copy of a House On The Prairie and if you think that this is the best movie of your life (or at least 2014), the only answer I can think of is: that's why so many rubbish movies have been released lately. Because the level of the quality has fallen drastically and the conveyor belt of the movie industry is catastrophic for the senses. OK, so straight to the point. First 45 minutes we are introduced to the farming, dust and the coming famine problems, nitrogen on the rise in the atmosphere, Earth is doomed, father and daughter found a super-secret location that NASA strategically placed for their eyes only. We see a lot of corn and even the nineties Children of The Corn was a better shallow slasher while this one turns out to be an American clichéd space marmalade, and my best fitting comparison for it is Armageddon which is not really a movie, but a joke. Wormholes, saving of the human kind, bringing resources, planting/replanting, Plan A /Plan B, frozen embryos to colonize a distant world, overcoming gravity, scientists and even a quantum physics and so much camera- philosophy that Kubrick will turn in his grave, daddy-please-don't-go-to-space-cause –I'm- gonna-cry, bam the watch on the floor (I don't wanna see you anymore), counting while going into the stratosphere, Lego-robot which somehow was better acting than the rest of the actors or at least was more fun. Wait, wait, did I say actors? Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway and Michael Caine (The rest of them are not worth mentioning apart from the crying daughter Murph who did her best job). Matthew McConaughey has one of the most annoying twangs ever and his jaundiced bad- version-face of Paul Newman cannot contribute to any script lately (let's not forget that without the help of Jared Leto and his masterful transformation in The Dallas Buyers Club his Oscar was going to hell). His mumbling could be understood only from the villagers in Kentucky and what he is on about Seriously, I needed subtitles to comprehend his actor's efforts in such a ""serious"" movie. How serious this movie was! I pushed myself to read couple of the 'serious' critical reviews and they had the audacity to call it ""scientific""??? Oh man, poor Anne Hathaway who looked sometimes at the camera and was likely apologizing for the mess she was in. I felt sorry for her. The script was the hell of the hells. Such nonsense with no credibility and no creativity at all. Total zero or even below the zero. As I said we left long before the end because my time is precious. I will open Isaac Asimov's (or Stanislaw Lem's) short stories and will be engulfed in characters and situations, so my brain will be given food for thought while all these poor people are going to see Interbol..cks and will be exposed on the radiation of a mediocrity (yes, I felt cheated like someone was trying to insult me). Well, if you who now read this review respect yourself and really like Kubrick, Moon, Gravity (and even Contact) and other good sci-fi don't waste your time and save your money. Today we wasted £40 including the drinks, the popcorn and the tickets and the only thing that I was inspired for was my generated anger for this text. My verdict on the scale from 1 to 10 is to give ONE for the director Christopher Nolan who needs a little encouragement and I am hoping he will not slip into the shoes of M. Night Shyamalan who have crafted a lot of rubbish lately as you know. God forbid that never happens. P.S.Don't tell me that I have sat there for 2 (it's actually 169 minutes) hours of a film and it had a great ending cause I don't want know.",1.0,SvetoslavGrigorov,2014/11/16,311,139
1461,Intermission,Irish attempt at mixing Lock Stock and Love Actually...,"I had no intention of renting this movie I'm the kind that likes my comedy crude and slapstick and usually involving scantily clad or nude women,and the PG (not 13 i hate 13) animated kind of movies. Yet every once in a while one of my friends or I has this itch to rent a different film and although most of the times we have met with disaster once in a while we have picked out gems like Lock Stock or Waking Ned Devine and so we keep trying these experiments, our experiments with comedies have largely been unsuccessful and I have come to realise the British-Irish-comedy movie formula a bit. This movie is an attempt at mixing two classics (Lock Stock and Love Actually) with the similar theme of seemingly unfamiliar peoples lives intersecting. A single reading of the synopsis ensured that I knew the following things. This movie would have the similar formula of introducing the characters to us, almost boring us with seemingly meaningless event and conversations, and then suddenly justifying everything in one glorious finale. All the while they will also find themselves in precarious and humorous circumstances. (The Lock Stock influence ). Also the characters would be in the constant search for love (or happiness) and will sooner or later get what they want (or realise it) but not before a tumultuous journey. (the love actually part). Common themes are the large number of characters who are related somewhat and others who are absolutely unrelated all coming together in the end. Now this sounds like being tailor made for all audiences including lovers of British comedy, women, the adventurous, the drama lovers, and obviously those who swear by the festival films. Except that somehow it ends up pleasing none of them. Some scenes are worthless and humourless to boot.Leading to large stretches of boredom. The humour is so dry that forget us lovers of loud humour even those who like their humour subtle will struggle to find it. Lovers of drama will find the lack of sadness and long conversations unappealing. The romantics will find the romance lacking and will be surprised by the absence of good looking people. The big end is actually not that big, nor that funny, nor that profound. The only people who will come out happy will be the festival lovers who will bask in the boredom and find meaning the meaningless scenes. There were positives to the movie though. Even though I don't have the superior intellect (or the drive to be different) like the festival fanatics I like movies that let you infer what the scene has to say and not have everything in black and white. This movie has a few good scenes and events that are left unexplained and it left up-to us to infer what we can.(this positive is negated by the sheer number of such scenes, and the presence of explaining scenes when none were required). This movie will not draw many laughs but has loads of smiles. The only genuinely funny scene that I found was the coffee scenes. The thing is the smiles and the almost good ending (cannot even be compared to the classics) ensure that you actually complete this movie on a higher note but even then this did not rise above the lower expectations that i had. In all a thoroughly ordinary film whose rating will be popped up by the drama and festival film lovers who will die before they say anything bad about a movie thats as boring and dry as this can be. Still I'm sure that there is a market for such films, I cannot venture to guess who they are but the rating show that this market has been reached. Wouldn't recommend it for anybody who likes commercial cinema, even lovers of big budget drama (say a million dollar baby or Gay Mountain) would best stay away from this film. -s loads of boring and meaningless scenes, not really much in it for anybody. +/-s loads of unexplained scenes, very dry and often morbid humour. +s loads of smiles, good ending (not worth the ride), a few really good scenes. total 4/10 (even after lowered expectations would not comment on absolute terms as I'm not the target audience for such movies).",4.0,kooleshwar,2007/03/12,3,0
1462,Interstellar,Worst sf film in 20 years,This film is an anti-intellectual zenith. It is offensive at least for someone who has a rudimentary knowledge of astrophysics and the theory of relativity. I have never seen such s-f movie full of nonsense. At least in the last 20 years. Every single law of physics is broken or adjusted to Hollywood pulp. Ethical problems concerning time travel were already discussed 60 years ago. Medea/Gaia hypothesis is an old fairy tale. Pseudo- philosophical use of feelings with respect to the multi-dimensional time-space is simply ridiculous. Situations that occur in the vicinity of the event horizon: I can only say: serious case of ignorance. And standard use moral treatise about human nature based on common sense is too obvious. Someone who makes movies based on comic books shouldn't be allowed to make a s-f movie. Really bad choice!! I am disappointed. Very disappointed. 1 point is for the robots.

1463,Intermission,diverting and entertaining,"Is Intermission a great movie? No. But it doesn't have to be. It's thoroughly enjoyable, and I can't understand why some viewers have so much trouble with that idea. It's a slice of life intersection, where the most we can hope for is a little self-recognition, a little empathy. You will not be moved much by anyone's performance. At the same time, though, there's good acting. Now I may be biased, but I thought Cillian Murphy was fantastic, as well as whoever plays Oscar, and Shirley Henderson. Others are parodies, like Colm Meaney's ""hard-as-nails c**t,"" or Colin Farrell's bad boy with a soft spot for woks. So give this a go, sit back and enjoy yourself. Some of the camera work is a bit dizzying at first, but I found myself really enjoying the feeling of walking through the scenes, and the long takes. That kind of work is often very difficult, and I appreciated what went into the film more after watching it a second time and realizing the difficulties in timing.",10.0,amyew914,2006/01/28,5,1
1464,The Wailing,"Great film, not flawless but why Hollywood is unwatchable","Movies like these from South Korea are the reasons why Hollywood has become unwatchable. It may not be completely original and has some flaws. But the acting is excellent, the location is perfect for this type of a horror/macabre tale and the dialogue is always reasonably engaging. In summary, something or someone is killing the people in a local small town. It's uncertain what is happening and who is behind it. Is it madness? A disease? But it also appears that some of the local people are killing each other and for an unknown reason, potentially some type of madness. Our protagonist is a police officer and his daughter becomes one of the afflicted. He tries to find an answer and also save his daughter from being another victim. This is a pretty long film and at some point you wonder if it's really worth the payoff. And it gets surprisingly bloody at certain points too. It takes its twists and turns and it is engaging. The ending and meaning itself was very confusing to me. And parts of this movie follow the horror/macabre genre of ""must act dumb"" or ""must not say anything for reasons unknown and not ruin a surprise."" But otherwise, this movie is far better than the run of the mill. And it's creepy.",8.0,imdb-45,2016/07/25,21,8

1466,Pulp Fiction,Not very original,"It seems to me that much of the stylistic elements of the movie were taken from the 1955 film Kiss Me Deadly. Kiss Me Deadly was full of quirky characters and had a mysterious chest which contained a glowing object. The main difference in style was that the humor in Kiss Me Deadly is much more subtle, while Pulp Fiction is trying real hard to get a laugh or a reaction. Because of that, I feel that Kiss Me Deadly is the far superior of the two.",2.0,brenttraft,2001/02/19,100,47
1467,Pulp Fiction,Enormously Overrated,"The proof of the pudding, they say, is in the eating. The proof of the movie is in the watching. Most of the top 250 IMDb movies have kept me glued to my seat--with this one I found my mind wandering to that jigsaw puzzle I hadn't finished or the possibility of some popcorn. I found I had very little interest in the characters or in what was going on. I asked myself why. Technically the film is very good. The actors all hit their marks and Samuel L. Jackson is particularly outstanding. I liked Maria de Madeiros also as Bruce Willis' wife Fabienne. The camera work is occasionally interesting, as the long scene where we watch Bruce Willis listen unemotionally to Marsellus go on. Interesting, certainly, but rather pointless. Indeed, that's the problem: so much of what goes on is pointless. It's a big long shaggy dog story, told by one of those irritating people who can't get the story straight and have to keep going back: ""Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you about that. Well, you know what I was telling you before . . ."" I tried to find some justification for the higgledy-piggledy way in which this story is told. It does result in the best scene being the last one. But if this scene was the point then why not design the script so that the action is seen to be moving toward this goal and cut out everything that happens afterward? In the end I don't think Tarentino knew what story he was telling and that's why so much is so pointless. The scenes of Butch attempting to control his temper, of his dilemma whether to help Marsellus, and the final scene in the restaurant are all good and entertaining as far as they go but they don't fall into a coherent framework. And the rest is quite dull. The dialogue is not witty or clever although it occasionally has its moments. The constant profanity is as pointless as the rest; the point of profanity is presumably to emphasize what one is saying, but if everything is emphasized, nothing is. The mind becomes numbed by it. It's like someone who shouts all the time. Eventually you stop listening. The quotes give you a pretty good idea of what the dialogue is like: when ""Shut the f*ck up, fat man!"" is listed as a memorable quote, you know how inane the conversation is. That this poorly composed script should have won an Oscar is a pretty clear indictment of the Academy.",5.0,Bologna King,2006/08/17,558,262
1468,Taxi Driver,Ain't no Hitchcock,"The cinephotography was superb, as was the editing. Continuity errors mar the film. The characters, a semi-literate disturbed ex-grunt, a troubled child hooker and a solipsistic shallow, preppy campaign aide do not grab the attention. Both Cybill Shepard and Jodie Foster to a very good job in limited roles. De Niro manages to combine violent, disturbed, repetitive, banal and boring all in one role. The scene changes are abrupt. The plot has chaotic jumps, not an arc of drama. Basically a waste of time unless you are into the lower end of imitation cine noir films. Ain't no Hitchcock.",3.0,jaynicks,2006/08/01,27,13

For me the film was quite dull and boring with little suspense, drama and extremely slow pacing. I'm intrigued to know why this film was nominated for 4 Academy Awards, as well as its ongoing rave as a classic. Perhaps I missed the point of the movie, as I was waiting it to end from half way through. However I did notice some positives. Firstly it is clear, De Niro's performance as a troubled veteran-turned-taxi driver was masterful, and he showed a clear character development during the film. Another positive for me is the aesthetics of New York, as its darker sides are shown. Lastly the score was one that stood out for me, with relaxing music in scenes of driving. 6/10 - a good effort, but too much caution over ensuring not too quick pacing.",6.0,alexcole10,2020/06/13,113,86
1472,The Chorus,Heartwarming Moments and Soaring Moments: My Discovery of Les Choristes,"I was first introduced to Les Choristes in my eighth grade French class. I, an uncultured teenager, groaned at the mention of another subtitled movie. Spending the last period before lunch deciphering a poorly staged foreign film was not an idea I relished. Much to my dismay, the scene set on two elderly men reminiscing about their childhood. Fast forward 35 minutes for me and 50 years into the past of the old men, and I was in love with the romantically hopeless setting and the captivating soundtrack. Les Choristes had proved itself to be a heartwarming (though admittedly unoriginal) film that portrays renewed hope amongst corruption. The film prefaces at a desolate climate at a 'troubled' boys' school post World War II. Rachin (François Berléand), the bitter headmaster, rules with the overbearing model of ""Action-Reaction"". As the children act out, Rachin quickly and harshly punishes them, squashing any idea of freedom from his corruption. The maltreated boys whittle away in spirit as does their freedom to grow. Enter new supervisor Clément Mathieu (Gérard Jugnot), a failed musician, knocking at the gates of the school, Fond De L'Etang (Rock Bottom). Quickly excelling under the tutelage of their 'underground' choir director Mathieu, the boys prove to be of more maturity than the name of their school would ever suggest. Whenever Mathieu suggests change, whether it is in regards to more humane disciplinary action against the wishes of Rachin, earning the respect of his students, or bashfully presenting his affections to a student's single mother, a flicker of fear on his face betrays his emotions. This is where the strength of Jugnot's acting lies. It is not found in large, overblown moments; Jugnot's quality is found in his small smiles of support to his students behind Rachin's back, in his caretaking of a bullied student, and in his softly spoken decisions of punishment and reward for the choir's talented, moody soprano soloist. Though Jugnot plays Matieu with phenomenally subtle emotions, the plot does not prove to be quite so sincere. It's a path well- traveled: An unexperienced teacher implements positive change by taming a group of abandoned students trapped in a corrupt system. Remind anyone else of Mr. Holland's Opus or The Dead Poet's Society? In fact, an old French film called The Cage of Nightingales (1945) served as inspiration for Les Choristes, so any originality that may have been left cannot be claimed by the writer/director, Christophe Barratier. While charming, the idea of a catalytic teacher painstakingly trying to connect to his students soon loses its warm, romantic quality and becomes stale. As a self-proclaimed music connoisseur, my struggle with the plot was soon forgotten with the airy, haunting musical score. Long, moving melodies of the boys' choir are used in perfect succession with the rising and falling hope in the movie. An orchestra-heavy background sounds dreamy in comparison to the unpolished voices of the boys' choir, which only further adds authenticity and playfulness. No knowledge of the French language is needed to enjoy this music, and any flaws with the less than original storyline are enveloped by the stirring score. It's raining as I now finish my review. Against all odds, the sun is still shining through the gloom to create an unexpected atmosphere of both melancholy and joy, much as the boys of Fond De L'Etang do. In this weather, I am reminded of the choir's beautiful, haunting voices, Clément Mathieu's hopeful story, and, most of all, of how a young eighth grade girl was able to look past unoriginality to find an uplifting tale of hope in Les Choristes.",8.0,marisweetman,2014/09/24,0,0

1475,Hotel Transylvania,Hotel Transylvania Review,"When monsters want to go on vacation, they turn to Count Dracula's (Adam Sandler) Hotel Transylvania, a luxurious castle resort where they can simply be themselves without the possibility of being bothered by humans. For one special weekend, Dracula invites some of his creature friends: The Invisible Man (David Spade), The Mummy (CeeLo Green) among others to celebrate the 118th birthday of his daughter Mavis (Selena Gomez). Things do not go according to plan when a human named Jonathan (Andy Samberg) manages to crash Dracula's party and then begins to fall in love with Mavis. Since I plan on seeing Hotel Transylvania 2 tomorrow, I thought I would first look at Hotel Transylvania. Adam Sandler has not had too many good movies this millennium. Most of them are just bad, stupid comedies. This one is a little stupid but I wouldn't call it bad. This is an animated kids movie so I wasn't expecting highbow or too deep. I thought it did its job with what it was trying to do. The animation isn't groundbreaking to say the least but I thought it was decent. The monsters all looked the way they were supposed to and their powers and abilities were well done as well. I can't speak too much more about that seeing that the theatrical version was in 3D and had more bells and whistles and I just saw it on Netflix. I also thought that the voice-over work was pretty good all around. Adam Sandler was great as Dracula and had some funny moments and some good one liners while also having great chemistry with the other characters. He was supposed to be Dracula but he was really just another Adam Sandler character but I didn't mind. What was also odd was the french accent Jon Lovitz used as Quasimodo. Being that this is an Adam Sandler film, the other characters are voiced by actors who have previously worked with Sandler in other films. The film did have other funny moments not involving Adam Sandler as most of its comedy comes from its portrayal of all the different monsters and their interactions with Dracula and one another. Most of the jokes were childish but I still found them funny. Underneath all of that is just a story about a father-daughter relationship where the father is just trying to raise his daughter and wanting what is best for her and trying to keep her safe. There's also a good message on stereotypes and prejudice. Sure the story may be a little cliché but it is just so damn cute. Score: 7/10 keithlovesmovies.com",7.0,keithlovesmovies,2015/09/25,2,2
1476,Primal Fear,About that ending... *SPOILERS*,"I first saw PRIMAL FEAR years ago and I remember not liking it, but not why. Now, I'm not supposed to ever watch this movie again (an actor friend was thisclose to getting the role that made Ed Norton a star, which is why AMERICAN HISTORY X and FIGHT CLUB are also banned from discussion). But PRIMAL FEAR was on TV the other night, and I wanted to see it without bias. I still don't really like it. Norton, of course, is magnificent, but the movie is plagued with flaws. The murder was unnecessarily graphic (did we really need to see blood spurting from severed fingers?), and the second act was slow, muddled, and, when all was said and done, rife with red herrings (nothing bored me more than the talk about fluctuating real estate prices, which ultimately didn't factor in the plot's resolution). And then there's that final revelation, which raised several unanswered questions. Ok, if Aaron was faking it the whole time, then how long had he been affecting that stutter? The whole time he was an altar boy? If that's true, then he was planning the murder before he even met the archbishop - which means he would at that time have no reason to murder him. However, if he created that speech pattern after the murder, surely there would be plenty of people who'd know he was lying. Other problems. Was there no effort at all to locate the missing girlfriend? What happened to Alex after he divulged the existence of the incriminating videotape? And wasn't that abnormally large bandage on his ear a too-obvious way for Gere to spot him? And couldn't that perfunctory chase sequence have been eliminated? We know they would have caught him so he could supply crucial information; if he had gotten away, what would have been the reason for the scene? Still more. Speaking of that videotape, why would the bishop record every sexual encounter on a single tape, only to tape over the previous meeting to record the latest one? Wasn't it awfully convenient that he was killed before he could erase the important evidence? Did he tape others too, or just the three relevant to the plot? Also, wouldn't the judge have been required to order a complete psychiatric evaluation for Aaron before having him committed? Even though Aaron claimed to not have remembered his assault on the Linney character, couldn't he have easily heard about it from a guard or someone? (Of course he didn't - we'd have no surprise ending if he did.) And what's the probability that this kid could have duped all those intelligent, educated professionals so successfully? If you can answer these questions for me, I'd love to hear from you. And, while I'm nitpicking, there's something else in the movie that annoyed me - Laura Linney's smoking. It was terribly obvious that Linney is a nonsmoker. Every time she lit up she would awkwardly hold the stick near her face while never taking a drag (the scene in the bar after she receives the videotape is the prime example). Sure, she'd occasionally put it between her lips, but the camera would always cut away before she inhaled, and the one time I saw her breathe out, there clearly was no smoke being exhaled. Why have her character smoke? As a smoker, I cannot tell you how distracting this is. Whenever I notice this in movies, I am momentarily taken out of the story and instead am watching a documentary of an actress unconvincingly holding a lit cigarette. (Another example that comes to mind is Ashley Judd in DOUBLE JEOPARDY.) Add all this to the stuff there we've all seen before in courtroom dramas - surprise testimony, murmurs from the peanut gallery that cause the judge to pound his/her gavel, a personal relationship between the prosecution and defense attorneys, a less-than-honorable John Mahoney (anyone else remember SUSPECT?) - and I now know why I don't like PRIMAL FEAR. It's the type of movie that needs about fifteen minutes trimmed from it (that chase scene can be the first to go) while requiring a couple of additional scenes to clarify plot points. But while I mentioned DOUBLE JEOPARDY here, I am in no way comparing the two; PRIMAL FEAR is twice as good as DOUBLE JEOPARDY - a 4/10 instead of 2/10.",4.0,FeverDog,2002/09/02,91,56
1477,The Chorus,A Simple Appeal To The Heart: Kindness Can Be A Good Thing,"So many professional reviews of this film grudgingly admit they were moved by it, as if it's a sin to dislike a well-made movie that moves one emotionally, as if it is always a bad thing to appeal to the better emotions, to the heart instead of the head. ""The real index of civilization,"" said novelist De Berniere,""is when people are kinder than they need to be."" In an age of abrasive political commentators who have forgotten about compromise and genuine understanding, it's a joy to encounter a film about kindness and concern, a film where a firm but concerned teacher makes a selfless difference in many lives. That's what this charming and occasionally upsetting film is about, as French legend Gerard Jugnot portrays a man who brings music and discipline to a group of underprivileged students.

1478,Spider-Man 2,Takes every element from the first film and improves on it!,"It only happens very rarely that a sequel surpasses the original (Terminator 2, Star Wars Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back) and after the relative disappointment that was the original my expectations for the second film in the series had decreased. When I finally did sit down in the cinema to see this film I was a bit anxious. But my anxiety was quickly put to rest because Spider-Man 2 took the premises from the first film and improved upon them all. The first Spider-Man film a well meaning picture but quite as good as it could have been the second film is a good film for both hardcore fans like myself and the broader audience. First off, the acting in the second film has improved tremendously. Tobey Maguire feels more right in the second film. I found him quite shallow in the first film but in the second one he seems to have developed more depth. More nuances have found their way into his acting in the second film making the character more believable and less of a square. Kirsten Dunst is never a good actress but I found her a little less annoying in this film than in the first and therefore I felt I could tolerate her presence. James Franco is decent but still has a problem with portraying nuances which basically means that in order for his performance to work he has exaggerate every emotion his character feels. As it is with most superhero movies the villain is the most interesting character and Sam Raimi couldn't have picked a better actor than Alfred Molina to play Otto Octavius aka Doc Ock. I'm a big fan of Willem Dafoe but I didn't like his performance in the first Spider-Man film very much and therefore I was delighted when Alfred Molina turned out to be a far better villain than Willem was. His performance was both menacing and nuanced and even though the character isn't always directly in control of his actions (making him somewhat misinterpreted) Molina's performance makes the character highly credible and undoubtedly the most interesting character in the film. The effects have improved which is logical considering that it has been 2 years since the first film hit the cinemas. Also I found that Doc Ock was much better suited for flashy moves and cool fights than Green Goblin ever was so in that aspect the film is far superior to the first film as well. Especially the train fight will, I think, go into history as one of the best hero/villain showdowns in history if not the best. The computer effects have become slightly more subtle making the film seem more polished. There were still a few unfortunate scenes were the CGI was pretty obvious but overall the effects have improved dramatically and received a well earned Oscar. The musical score continues in the same epic fashion from the first and Danny Elfman does an exceptional job as usual. The score is both thrilling and epic but it is also subtle when it has to be and that aspect of the score works wonderfully as well. Elfman has some experience in super hero scoring (having done both Batman and Hulk aside from Spider-Man) and it shows as the score is very appropriate and fitting. Two thumbs up on the music. In terms of story telling the second film is also far better than the first. I found the first film to be very unoriginal in terms of its story. Anyone who has just an ounce of knowledge into the myth of Spider-Man knows the story beforehand and thus the film becomes very predictable and boring quite frankly. The second film did not have this problem. It was a breath of fresh air. The story seems to flow more from the heart this time around. Raimi proved in the first film that he could take a situation from the comics and translate it reasonably to the screen. In the second film he proves that he can make a highly original story as well and make it entertaining. It should also be added that Spider-Man 2 has a lot more of the humor like the kind that appears in the comics. J.K. Simmons who was one of the elements in the first film returns in his role and he is absolutely hilarious. He truly embodies the spirit of J. Jonah Jameson. There is also a very funny elevator scene which should be mentioned. Some people complained that Raimi has turned mainstream with the Spider-Man films. That is a load of rubbish and Raimi proves it by adding some elements from his cult films, the Evil Dead series. He even lets Bruce Campbell tell Spider-Man off as if to symbolize that he hasn't forgotten where he came from. All in all Spider-Man 2 surpasses the first film in the franchise in almost every way imaginable Spider-Man 2 is twice as engaging, entertaining and heartfelt than the first film in the series. 9/10",8.0,MinorityReporter,2005/04/27,165,120
1479,Ferris Bueller's Day Off,"Genuinely, Ingeniously Funny","First of all let me say that this movie is genuinely, ingeniously funny, the watch-it-twelve-times-and-it-never-gets-old kind of movie. I myself have seen it seven and a half times and will probably view it again before the end of summer. The movie stars then 23-year-old Matthew Broderick as 17-year-old Ferris Bueller, a high school student who would like nothing better than to be done with school. So he gives in to a strong temptation to cut class and go to downtown Chicago with friends Cameron and girlfriend Sloane (who he gets out of school extremely cleverly, and quite hilariously i might add!). It doesn't take long for principal Edward Rooney to catch on to Ferris's skipping, so he tries as hard as he can to catch him, but is going on about it quite unsuccessfully. All through the movie we learn of Cameron's struggles with his parents and life itself, and through all the hilarity of the movie Cameron finds a part of himself that he hadn't been able to find before. The movie consists of several several fun scenes, such as the German American Appreciation Day Parade, in which Ferris climbs onto the Great Float and the parade-goers dance to ""Danke Schoen"" by Wayne Newton and ""TWIST AND SHOUT"" of course, by the Beatles. Other very important characters are Jeanie Bueller, his revenge-seeking sister who can't seem to understand why Ferris gets away with everything, and Grace, the absent-minded and honest-to-a-fault secretary. There are so many left out parts and characters but to see them all you'll have to watch the movie (you won't regret it!). ""Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it."" -ferris bueller I give this movie 2 thumbs up, if only i had more hands i could give it a higher rating....",,ferrisbuellersloanepeterson2003,2003/08/06,40,27
1480,The Green Mile,A Picture To Remember,"I believe I'm one of the few human beings that had no idea of what is movie was about. I heard a lot about this picture, of course, but I didn't even know what the main story was. Maybe it's a plus, since it allowed me to see the entire thing without knowing what was gonna happen next. Well, like other death row movies, this one really touched me; ending with people lives, despite what they've done, is a sad subject for me. It must be the most terrifying feeling to know you're going to be killed in a matter of minutes. Preparing yourself for the electric chair might be even worse. As a thrilling Stephen King's story, ""The Green Mile"" brings an innovation-- this time, a character has a special gift of healing people, like a saint. It is indeed beautiful to see that big and apparently bad guy helping people as he can. Filmmakers are mean in this case-- they make you adore the character, just to kill him in the end and let you down. It happened to me as well, I cried in the end and it is not a common thing for me-- so by that you can imagine how strong this movie is. A masterpiece in matter of acting, story and life.",8.0,raulfaust,2012/11/18,4,3
1481,Hotel Transylvania,Monsters Going Wild,"Hotel Transylvania has a simple concept: classic campy monsters staying in a hotel where humans are not allowed because they think we're evil. It doesn't sound too fresh but it looks fun. Behind this concept is a father-daughter-relationship that seems to follow the footsteps of other great recent animated films. The result is, it's not getting there yet but it's still as delightful as it's suppose to be. It's one of those films that it's so crazy, you'll instantly like it. Most of the gags are clever and ridiculous. Overall, it's an endless fun entertainment. Though, the film sometimes feels like a mediocre animated kids film. Generic family film elements are there but they are used in a different way. There is often slapstick and toilet humor but the gags are best when it's outrageously absurd. Every set pieces are swift, quirky, and exciting. The voices of the characters sound silly at glance but the actors made them pretty likable. When the craziness slows down, there's a sweet bit of Dracula's relationship between Mavis and Jonathan, and some brooding. The drama is a little effective. It's not as strong as most recent animated films. It's more focused at being fun and hilarious. It's great when it stays to the roots of a cartoon like showing peculiar looking characters acting like lunatics. The best laughs are when the monsters are expressing their misanthropy in a ludicrously paranoid way, and when they're just making fun of each other. Mainstream pop culture song numbers kind of tone things down, but the song number at the end didn't affect the breathtaking and emotional climax. Hotel Transylvania is good enough for the whole family even though it's raucous. Fans of the animation genre would enjoy this a lot more. Since it's directed by a cartoon expert, it contains a lot of absurd and exciting scenes that is similar to his shows. Although, some might expect something more since many animated films these days are deeper and powerful, leaving the old habits behind. Hotel Transylvania still has the heart but it's just not as compelling as the others. If you're in for the joys then this will give you a good time. My rating may be too high, but this my thing. I always enjoy this kind of animation.",8.0,billygoat1071,2012/10/12,53,33

There is just too much going on here culminated by a little brat running around and throwing rocks into buses and cars which obviously cause mayhem. The film is just too choppy to work. One woman loses her husband after 14 years to another while her younger sister is ripped off by a suitor. This causes the former sister to become a bitter vetch and walk around in clothes not worth believing. The older sister also becomes embittered but soon finds romance.

Three starts go as a compliment to Kevin S., and the main plot - a bit ""Fargoish"". The cinematography, camera work, edit and music are all in place, as they should be in a Hollywood production.

1487,Goodfellas,"As far back as I can remember, I've always wanted to be a gangster...","Who would you call a nice guy? Probably a work colleague who, to the detriment of his time, agrees to drink a glass of beer with you and listen to crazy talk about lost love. And after the third glass of beer it becomes clearly clear to you that this is, in general, a nice guy. The heroes of this film will not negotiate with you, will not show understanding, and if you owe something to these people, then death becomes not the worst way out of this situation. This is a film about the life of the mafia . Even when Henry was in school, he saw how simple it all goes to people from the "" family "". They robbed, cheated and even killed people, but their opinions did not change. They were afraid, and therefore - respected. They were not afraid of anyone and they had good reason. Naturally, young Henry was struck by such a life, and in his heart he had long since matured in order to start his own criminal career and, finally, to become a real gangster. And this story is dedicated to his ascent, his victories and his collapse. Despite the fact that the events of the film occur predominantly in the 70s of the last century, this picture makes us recall our nostalgic memories of the unforgettable computer game "" Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven "", where events took place in the 30s. In addition to the general atmosphere in these works of art, some scenes from the film frankly migrated to the screens of computer monitors. Remarkable is the fact that the protagonist of the film - Ray Liotta was subsequently involved in the sound of Tommy Angelo - the main character of the already mentioned game. According to many sites that are directly related to the field of cinema, and some film magazines, "" Glorious guys "" - this is the most realistic film about the mafia ever created. In this aspect, it is difficult for me not to agree with them, when scenes of beatings, which the Godfather trilogy and the painting Once Upon a Time in America often neglected, are often swept across the frame. Martin Scorsese took the story based on real events, reworked it into a script, and created from it not a banal tale about the mafia, but a hard interesting film that is worth watching several times. Henry . The protagonist of the film, through whose eyes we see everything that happens in the film. His character performed by Ray Liotta is laconic and not too emotional. But this does not mean that he is boring. His acting potential is revealed closer to the second half of the film, when Henry's life begins to lose its former stability, and now he has to really survive in order to stay afloat. Jimmy I have already seen so many films with the participation of Robert De Niro that it would seem there is nothing surprising. This actor perfectly showed a variety of images, from comedies to strong dramas. And yet, Robert is surprised. He is fully revealed in the film. His character is a gangster with experience, who has engaged himself in all areas of the criminal life of society. His preference is robbery, however, if necessary, he is capable of anything, including murder. Tommy . The brightest character in this movie. In all likelihood, this is the best role played by Joe Pesci . Here he was given a real revelation, which cannot be said about such paintings as "" Home Alone "" or "" Deadly Weapon "". His character is small, obviously with a chronic neurosis, a gangster, with a complex youthful fate, who is very proud of what he has achieved. He does not allow anyone to insult himself, while he will allow himself clearly more than acceptable, at any convenient occasion grabbing a knife or a gun. It is necessary to mention that this is also a very talkative, and therefore very funny character. Honored Oscar for Best Supporting Role. The director of the film, Martin Scorsese , the author of such masterpiece films like Gangs of New York and the Oscar-winning ""The Departed, "" created a film that perfectly complements Godfather , telling the most tough and interesting story about the life of the mafia. I recommend viewing this film to anyone who likes masterpieces, to all sincere cinema fans, since this is a really interesting film, which doesn't need a half-hour buildup at a time of two and a half hours. The film clings from the first minutes and releases at the moment when the final credits are on the screen. Watch it ...",7.0,mrdestroyer2001,2019/04/24,6,4
1488,Moon,an Oscar worthy sci-fi drama.,"In the not to distant future, Astronaut Sam Bell(Sam Rockwell) works for Lunar Industries, he has to live on a space station on the moon for 3 years, mining it's resources and sending it back to earth.

One day while working Sam has an accident, and almost dies, but somehow is saved. But things begin to take a turn for the weird, when Sam sees the person that saved him,that person looks amazingly like him, and he asks him who he is, he says he's him 3 years earlier. So is Sam in some sort alternate time line, or has been cloned, or is he just going crazy? A well made film. Some might compare it 2001(1968), and it does not beat around the bush, that it was inspired off it, but when you see it, you'll come to find it's pretty much it's own movie. Sam Rockwell gave quite a performance, you really got in the moment with him every time, he really gave it his all, I hope he won't be missed by the Oscars. And Kevin Spacey has the voice of Gerty was also great, the best computer character next Hal 9000 and K.I.T.. Duncan Jones is such a brilliant director, he is such a visionary.

1489,Crash,Crash it does...,"There is a real tragedy about this film. No, I'm not talking about the issue of racism in America (or anywhere) which this film feebly tries to address, but rather how a good idea for a movie and an impressive cast were wasted on this overcooked turkey. This film veers into overkill within the first few lines (Don Cheadle's hideously contrived little monologue about LA) and just keeps going. Haggis has taken the most delicate and sensitive subject in the New American consciousness and slapped his audience across the face with it for two hours. If Haggis had engraved the word ""racism"" onto a five inch nail and hammered it into my skull, it would've been more subtle and less painful than sitting through this film. If it weren't bad enough that he puts his characters in some highly implausible situations (some of which are handled very well from a technical perspective, I must admit) throughout the film, it certainly nails the coffin of believable film-making shut that every single person in this movie is racist to the point where they don't seem to talk about anything else. Every character here seems to have the same dilemma – that their life is wrought with racism and prejudice – but the reasons behind this are never explored. All the characters here are ""connected"" in such a contrived way, one has to wonder if any thought went into it. Beyond this, we are given no reason to try and like or relate to anybody we're introduced to, and the dialogue is so relentlessly obvious and didactic that it almost sounds like it came out of a high school improvised-drama class. Take note, Mr Haggis, we are not as stupid as you seem to think we are. Because of this, every character soon becomes entirely two dimensional as their prejudice/anger/misery is spelled out for us in almost monosyllabic terms. Presumably the point, not that it could be missed, is that we are all a little racist. Haggis aims to show us this by having all of his characters talk more shamelessly about their views than even the most bigoted people I have ever known. What this film seems utterly devoid of is subtlety. It is subtlety which would have made the story much more realistic, powerful, significant and enjoyable to those of us with more than sub-human emotional intelligence and, by extension, much less insulting to that same fraction of the audience. The casting is superb and the acting is good (though far from being anybody's best work), but even a group of actors as fine as this couldn't have grounded such fantastically over-the-top characters. Mark Isham's horribly contrived Zimmeresque score does nothing to detract from the brazen theatrics of Haggis' direction either. In short, this is a grossly overrated, almost child-like fable of urban discontent that aims far higher than it ever reaches and is nowhere near as clever or important as it thinks it is. It would have been far more interesting and far more validating if there was any interest here in trying to understand the cause of racism, but that's not Haggis' agenda. Presumably, the point of this tripe was to highlight something that should need no highlighting to (white, middle class) people who are basically ignorant about it or consider it a myth perpetrated by overtly liberal media or minorities who have a chip of their shoulder. In other words, this is a movie made BY white people who have no realistic concept of what racism means from the other side (and why should they?) FOR white people who have no realistic concept of what racism means from the other side. If you are one of those people (and you probably don't know it if you are), you might enjoy this pretentious, self indulgent, steaming pile. If you have a modicum of common sense, a hint of social consciousness or the capacity to think for yourself in any way, you're better off looking for a copy of 'White Dog', 'Nothing But a Man', 'Shadows', 'Do The Right Thing' or any number of superior films that address the issue of racism with far more taste, intelligence and subtlety.",3.0,theskylabadventure,2006/09/24,39,24
1490,Crash,Roller-coaster of emotions,"Like Altman's classic Short Cuts, and Anderson's Magnolia, Crash, by writer/director Paul Haggis weaves a tale of multiple characters through the web of streets we have come to know as Los Angeles. Unlike those other two films this one has a very specific theme to explore. From the opening line uttered by Don Cheadle we know this is to be a film about how people relate, and from the interchange that follows between Jennifer Esposito and Alexis Rhee (pretty sure she plays the Korean female driver who rear-ended her) how people relate tends to be ruled by first impressions or prejudice. Race is paramount in this film, and all our preconceptions of who people are get twisted and turned through the intricate plot. With each new additional character we find another assumption, another stereotype, and then watch as that preconception is obliterated as the character develops. It is a credit to the deftly written script, tight direction and exceptional acting talent that every one of these many characters is fully realized on screen without ever feeling one-dimensional. I would love to discuss some of the details of what happens to explain how well it is done, but part of the magic of this film is allowing yourself to be taken on this ride. Mind you, this isn't a ride of pleasure. The first half of this film is unrelentingly in its ferociousness. I could literally feel my rage at some of the characters forming to a fever pitch. The fear and hatred I was confronting wasn't just on the screen, but in the pit of my stomach. And in one absolutely brilliant moment I was literally sobbing at the expectation of horror unfolding, only to be cathartically released in a most unexpected way. Mr. Haggis was in attendance at the screening I saw and explained that the idea for this film came to him one night sometime after 9/11 at about 2a.m. when his own memories of a car- jacking experience from 10 years before wouldn't leave him alone. Clearly this film was his way of relieving those demons of memory, using the catharsis of his art to unleash them and in doing so has given to all viewers of cinema an opportunity to examine our own preconceptions about race relations and how we treat each other and think of ourselves. He mentioned in the discussion after-wards that he likes to make films that force people to confront difficult issues. Films that ask people to think after the film has ended and not just leave saying: ""that was a nice film"". This isn't a ""nice"" film, and I would expect that it will provoke many a discussion in the ensuing weeks when it opens nation-wide. It's a discussion long overdue for this country, and it took a Canadian to bring the issue to the fore in this brilliant, thought provoking film.",10.0,Vitarai,2005/05/01,1035,679

Once again they couldn't have picked a better actor to portray the villain Spiderman has to face. Spiderman must take out Doc, save the city, save the girl, and still get good grades.

1495,Goodfellas,Goodfellas,"I have been looking at the top 100 movies list of IMDb and it is becoming so disappointing. The top 6 movies are of crime, murder, action and mafia. Casablanca is the only movie that is of its own category standing out alone at 7th place; but this time I at looking at GoodFellas at spot 17 - all time great movies. The story is based on true events and characters from a novel named ""Wise Guy"" written by crime reporter Nicholos Pileggi. It is about this boy Henry Hill born (Ray Liotta) in 1943 in a poor working class family who wanted to be in a gang since his boyhood because that gave him freedom, money, and respect from people. He joins hands with Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) and Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro). This trio starts by hijacking, stealing and selling goods from huge truck loads. Once arrested Hill starts dealing in drugs in prison and when out continues to do so. In the end, with difficult times, of police after him, with new enemies and having difficult times with his wife Karen (Lorriane Bracco)  he decides to be an informant to avoid prison sentence and gives in most of his gangster friends  good fellows! The movie is directed by Martin Scorsese, who like Tarantino has earned his reputation with cold blooded killing of people and mafia movies. He directs the movie well in all departments and combines with ample social, family and drama scenes to balance the dark narrative. All the actors have acted well, but the best in the lot is Joe Pesci who has played the weird cranky character of Tommy with such conviction that it should be remembered just for its sheer portrayal of characteristics. Ray Liotta who gets to play the central character is okay and his career till date shows that he has lost himself into mundane small roles. Robert De Niro is as good as ever and shows his brilliant insight to understanding deep dark characters  he loves to play. The movie progresses from 1950 till 1980s and Martin captures all those eras with much ease and details. Even though his movie is in the top 20 list - lately, seeing many of these mafia movies  I do not feel that much excited. It has become routine and mundane for me to watch the cold killings, glorifying killings, blood everywhere  showing crazy characters who pull out gun at any point to shoot someone. I feel sick at times for the world and the good directors who have not got over showing it on big screen.

Blackfish could work almost as a sequel, as where The Cove left us with a sea of blood amidst the entrapment and capture of a group of dolphins, Blackfish shows us the life of a group of killer whales in captivity at Sea World, more than likely where most of The Cove's dolphins would have ended up. What the film has in abundance is an archive of disturbing video footage showing unprovoked attacks by orca's on experienced trainers, which is something that Sea World executives have brushed off as trainer errors. Director Gabriela Cowperthwaite went into the film intending of making a documentary on Dawn Brancheau, the former Sea World trainer who was killed in 2010 by Sea World's most notorious orca, Tilikum. Yet what she uncovered with the help of interviews from former Sea World trainers was obviously too difficult to simply ignore. Brancheau's unfortunate death wasn't a one-off, nor was it the first time Tilikum had been responsible for the death of a trainer (it was the third), but it was the latest in a long line of deaths, mutilations and lucky escapes by orca's on both the trainers and on each other. The most unnerving of them all is the attack on Kenneth Peters, where the killer whale Kasatka drags him under water for long periods of time as if issuing a threat. But it's not in the video footage that Blackfish retains it's power, but in the testimonies given by those who experienced it first hand. Each interviewee seems riddled with guilt that they didn't do more for the orca's, and they give tearful recollections of the signs they failed to see. Sea World declined to be interviewed for the film, and it's of no surprise. The images are so damning that there is simply nothing they can say. Trainers would naively sign up being told tales of trainer misconduct being responsible for the near-fatalities or simply hushed up to avoid bad press. It's not an easy watch, especially those with a weak-stomach for real-life moments of horror, but this is a powerful film, exposing cruelty and corporate cover-ups on an appalling scale. It seems money is worth more than basic compassion for a fellow intelligent creature. [URL]",8.0,tomgillespie2002,2013/10/15,13,11
1499,Interstellar,Best movie I have seen in my life,"This movie was the best written, acted, visual effected, etc. movie. This movie was the best movie I have ever seen. I am a huge Christopher Nolan fan and this movie was his finest. Matthew McConaughey turned in his best performance of his lifetime. Anne Hathaway was an amazing supporting actress and compared to her performance in Les Miserables, I have no idea how she didn't get an Oscar for this. The visual effects were more than just Oscar worthy. They were pioneering. I have never seen anything like it. One thing I would recommend is having a little previous knowledge about space. Not like Einstein stuff though. I would recommend you see this movie as fast as you can if you are a Nolan fan or not.

Except when they don't somewhat later cause, you know, it just wouldn't have worked with all that landing and launching on other planets. Also it wouldn't have been impossible to send probes to the planets, because ... well, that wasn't in the script either. It was however possible, to think that a planet orbiting a gigantic black hole so close to its event horizon, that one hour stretches to seven years, might be a hospitable place to found a new civilization.

1502,Ferris Bueller's Day Off,Pretty bad now.,"Sorry folks but got to go against the norm here. I pretty much hated this. I watched it in the 80's & couldn't remember much about it other than I liked it. Watching it again, heaven knows how. The worst thing I found was that it had dated badly. The first Home Alone say, retains far more features which keep it relevant & able to stand the test of time than this. My main comment is identical to the correspondent below. I too spent the entire film just hoping against hope that Ferris did get his come uppence & that I'd forgotten it. But sadly he didn't & the ending was poor. I never saw the Rooney teacher as the 'baddie' nor found anything that happened to him remotely amusing. Infact I struggled to see where any of the laughs in the film as a whole were. Also, I found Ferris' dad an absolute drip & irritating. Nor was anything they actually did in the day off even slightly exciting. Had I had a choice of a going to a museum, watching baseball or walking alongside a float I'd have chosen school any time. It was hardly worthy of a day off. And at the risk of being labelled a leftie I didn't like to see the stealing of someones car & then have it speeding around the roads with a uninsured & inexperienced teenage driver at the wheel, trivialised & inserted into a film in the hope of a few cheap laughs. Likewise I've always found something a bit sick in people who use family member's deaths as a means of bunking off school or work, and again this was the basis of more humour. Of course that happens and of course it has a place in films. Someone pretending their nan had died would fit in fine in the Godfather or the Krays but it didn't do anything for this film. 3/10 the lively innovations.

There is an implication (or direct accusation) that evil is targeting this one man because of his sin, but it hits lots of other people before it touches him. The end is a total mess - very tense, they do try to keep you on the edge of your seat, but the issue with the unclear characters bothered me too much to really enjoy the movie.",3.0,kking-68641,2018/07/02,19,11

1506,The Wailing,A Smorgasbord of Many Genres and Near un-Killable Zombies,"SPOILER: This review is extremely difficult to pen without dropping spoilers, but I am going to try... Na Hong-jin's The Chaser (2008) audaciously broke one of cinema's golden rules to heartbreaking effect. His sophomore effort The Yellow Sea (2010) is a pulsating rush of blood and bone. 6 years later comes The Wailing, a gruesome blend of different genres and it is near impossible to pigeonhole. Na Hong-jin has graduated to a whole new level with The Wailing, a smorgasbord of investigative procedural, humour, horror, supernatural, family drama, and near un-killable zombies. Whether you are the filmmaker or the viewer, it can be really hard to start a film. No one sitting in the pitch-black cinema is your friend yet and the beginning of any film always feels like a forced act of intimacy for the viewer. A hooker can help. No, I don't mean a prostitute but a good first scene 😬. The Wailing opens with a verse from the Bible, Luke 24:38-39 and cuts to a scene of a forlorn man double hooking a worm before fishing from a boulder. The scene is beguiling, laden with an atmosphere of dread and your consciousness will immediately lock in the little noggin of information that his unusual act has a higher purpose. Two and a half hours later and after a post-movie long table discussion with 13 other animated persons and more than a day of further discussion on a WhatsApp chat group, I am wiser. The first scene of The Wailing is a blue-ribbon winner and so it goes for the rest of the film. The big story is easy - a Japanese stranger (Jun Kunimura) arrives in a little village and soon a mysterious sickness starts to spread. Grisly murders ensue and a strange young woman (Chun Woo-Hee) and a bombastic shaman (Hwang Jung-Min) enter into the fray. A bumbling and lazy policeman (Kwak Do Won) is drawn in and he has to get to the crux of the mystery in order to save his daughter. It is the intricate workings of the plot that needs a lot of unpacking. Forget about the age-old Hollywood adage that a good film has a plot that is easily summarised. The last time I had so much fun dismantling and assembling back a movie was Inception! The Wailing is a stupendous and sustained piece of masterful storytelling. It is loaded with frightful incidents and stuffed with mystifying characters. On top of that, it is genuinely terrifying as it preys on the goodness of ordinary people. God has seemingly excused Himself from the battleground as can be gleaned from a scene in which the church says it will not lift a finger to help. The story is compelling and riveting, and every twist, turn and outcome totally earned. The movie has a punishing runtime of 156 minutes not because of poor pacing, but because of the intricacies of the plot. There are plenty of bloody scenes for the gore-hounds but they are never ladled out to pump up a sagging plot. The plot never sags, not even for one instance. Na's use of music and sounds to heighten the suspense is brilliant. From plaintive tonal chords in the beginning to a full-blown thunderous ""tong tong qiang"" exorcism ritual, everything adds to the atmosphere of doom. Na has also achieved such sublime tonal shifts that I didn't even notice where I went from laughing out loud to pure heart-parked-in-my-mouth terror. The film is suffused with motifs, religious overtones and thematically rich. Even an innocuous scene of a young woman throwing stones has biblical weight. The storytelling is powerful and the twists perfectly angled into the story. So many times I had that ""aha"" feeling that told me I had the mystery figured out and the motivations of the characters down pat. But on hindsight, I realised the only thing I had figured out early is that this is one incredibly thought provoking piece of filmmaking. The Wailing practically roars through the final act delivering all manners of monstrosity and heartbreaking sadness with aplomb. The movie is long and rich, multilayered and satisfying. Prepare to be toyed, skewered, gutted, stabbed and get ready to be played like a violin. I know this review is rubbish and ladened with hyperboles, but I did not exaggerate or embellish, and I did you a huge favour by remaining vague with the plot. Believe me, it is extremely hard for me to do that. I know good films when I see them. It is the great ones that are not easy to decide on. The Wailing is not a great film in the strictest sense but it earns its place on a shelf of illustrious films that invite so many good debates with like- minded minds. These are films that are impossible for you to stay shut-up and have everything explained in a few by-lines. These are films that will never leave your head long after they are done, and when you least expect it the tendrils of the narrative will rise up and wrap around your consciousness like tentacles. There are not many films on this particular shelf and all of them have become classics. I do not use the word ""classic"" lightly, but I believe The Wailing may well prove to be one. You know how I know? The movie left more questions than answers in my mind, but yet it was never a frustrating cinematic experience. It is such a wonderful mindfcuk! The year is not over yet, but I have a feeling I will not see another film of this caliber. Films of this type are rare and such superb rare films wail out to be watched and experienced. Experience this.",9.0,ctowyi,2016/07/31,114,66
1507,Pulp Fiction,A true Tarantino classic,Pulp Fiction is one of those movies that not everyone can enjoy. Many people say that it's boring and senseless. It is true that the plot isn't something special but it isn't the plot that makes this movie so unique but the awesome script and great cinematography. Probably one of the greatest things in this movie are the dialogues. The dialogues just like in all other Tarantino movies aren't directly connected with the plot. Take the first dialogue between Samuel Jackson and John Travolta. They are talking about how a certain burger is called in France. This and many others dialogues don't have a direct relation with the plot line but their function is to somehow build the characters' personalities. The other thing that makes this movie so unique is the unexpected turn of events. Like in all other Tarantino movies you don't know who they are going to kill next or what is going to happen. The scene where Vincent shoots Marvin in the face is a great example for such unexpected turn of events. This makes the viewer more intrigued and thus makes the whole experience form the movie way better. There isn't much more that can be said about Pulp Fiction. It's not a movie that everyone will enjoy but still deserves to be seen.,9.0,maryolalov,2019/01/25,45,27

1509,Goodfellas,The Truth About The Mob Particularly Its Decline,"Robert De Niro,Ray Liotta and Joe Pesci together with Lorraine Bracco and Paul Sorvino star in this arguably greatest film about the mob - with respects to The Godfather saga particularly the first part - in this Martin Scorsese film based on the book written by Nicholas Pillegi's bestselling book ""Wise Guy"" known as ""Goodfellas"". It details the story of mob informant Henry Hill,portrayed by Liotta, about his twenty-five year life in the mob from 1955 when he was 12 years old until 1980 when he cooperated with the FBI that put his fellow mobsters into jail particularly Jimmy ""The Gent"" Conway,portrayed by De Niro; and mob underboss Paul Cicero,portrayed by Sorvino.It details into Hill's criminal life that he is involved in like extortion,robbery,hijacking and murder. It also provides the viewer the benefits that entails being part of the mob like the amount of money they are able to earn and the ability to be given special treatment particularly not going in line at Copacabana as well as the respect they achieve from the people in the neighborhood. Many film viewers in the past have accused of The Godfather of glamorizing mobsters particularly the mafia Dons like Don Vito Corleone and his successor Michael Corleone particularly the first part.While I certainly do not agree with the critics considering that the movie has shown how mob life can destroy one's family as shown in the movie,Scorsese made it a point for viewers to see clearly in this film how disastrous mob life is all about. It really has shown the crimes that they are involved with as well as the fear and anxiety these people constantly feel considering their way of life wherein crimes and murdering people are a parts of their daily life. It has also shown how much it lost its appeal particularly during its decline in the 1980's when the FBI intensified its commitment of putting people involved in organized crime behind bars.We get to see how the main characters ended up getting murdered like Tommy DeVito,portrayed by Pesci in his Oscar winning performance or how they spent the rest of their life in jail just like Cicero and Conway; and how fellow members of the mob made deals with the FBI like Hill in order to corroborate against their fellow mobsters or friends in the crimes that they are involved in and enter a Witness Protection Program to protect them from the mob. After watching this film since its release 27 years ago while this review is written,I must say that it really could be considered the best film about the mob as it is based on a true story and a true account of mob life particularly the so-called foot soldiers a.k.a wise guys or better yet goodfellas who does hits for the mob instead of a fictional account about Dons or leaders of organized crime families in The Godfather saga.It also provides us how truly unappealing this way of life is especially now that the mob no longer provides that much impact in society and the advancement of technology that have benefited the FBI in terms of investigation of mobsters and the deals or programs that mobsters get into whenever they help the FBI in bringing down organized crimes.This film makes it clear in that regard unlike The Godfather saga considering that the mob are still in their glory years during the settings of the three part movies during the 50's,60's and 70's unlike this movie when it was released in 1990. Overall,Goodfellas shows that truth about the mob,its way of life, and its decline from the time it was released until the present time.",10.0,Marian20,2017/09/07,5,3

This movie expresses a lot of the gangster ways and how they really did things. Summary: This is pretty much a biography on Henry Hill, who as a kid always wanted to be a gangster, and he actually worked for them. It shows how a young kid grew up helping the mafia and becoming a mobster himself. This is a true story and really shows what being a wise guy is all about. Overall: Definitely a 10/10 movie.

If you think kids don't pick up on these messages in movies, think again. If you go around claiming to be progressive and against discrimination, but ignore all the offensive crap in this movie and give it 10 stars regardless; you're lying to yourself and everyone else.

There are a few plays or novels which are so fantastic to see or read. The play is instant knowledge. Its like one of those instant energy drinks you read/watch it and you know why it is a classic. Any decent adaptation of the play would be great but this film is really great. I liked the treatment. Its just full of dialogs and actors. The director has not changed the play because the film medium. That's why it looks like a play with film like sets. There is not a single moment where you feel you are watching a film. It's obvious from the first scene that you are watching a play. I think this is one of the best adaptation of a play I have seen so far. Hoffman has done a wonderful job. Initially I though 47 years old Hoffman with makeup was not convincing with Kate Reid as her wife but as the film grows on you it doesn't matter at all. I liked the story so much. It's so realistic.

1517,Primal Fear,Primal Gere,"A beloved archbishop is brutally murdered, and an altar boy (Edward Norton) is seen fleeing the scene, covered in blood. All evidence seems to point to the boy as the culprit. A stereotypical Richard Gere/Tom Cruise character (played by Richard Gere), a hot-shot, high-powered, ruthless attorney, decides to go for even more fame and fortune and defend the boy. Everyone in the city, nay, the universe believes Aaron Stampler is responsible for the slaying, which of course isn't just a cold-blooded mow-down; no, it's also mutilation, as numbers were carved into the archbishop's chest and his eyes were gouged out. But Martin Vail (Gere) believes he can get his client cleared of all charges; his thoughts on Stampler's actual guilt, he thinks, are largely irrelevant. Opposing Vail as the prosecuting attorney is an ex-flame, Janet Venable, played by Laura Linney. (Side question: Has anyone seen Laura Linney and Joan Allen in the same room?) Oh sure, of course she's an ex-flame, because otherwise it'd be tougher to build up sexual tension between the two lawyers, which you apparently must have in courtroom dramas nowadays. The character of Venable seems to exist basically as a foil to Vail; she stomps about angrily, trying to assert herself as a woman lawyer while under the constant threat of job endangerment while somehow avoiding the incredible, awesome charms of Vail himself. I'm sure it was tough. Vail's gotta find a way to give the jury a reasonable doubt. At his service he has trusty employees played by Andre Braugher and Maura Tierney, but there's only so much they can do. Just when Vail thinks he's succeeding, he's smacked over the head with reality; in other words, like most any other courtroom drama you've ever seen. Will Vail prevail? Did Stampler do it? Well, there IS a twist to the movie; two of them, actually. The first comes a little more than an hour into the movie, after an analysis by a shrink (Frances McDormand); the second, naturally, comes in the waning minutes of the film. Neither is Earth-shattering, and you might even be able to see the second one coming from a few miles away. On the plus side, Gere seems to be having plenty of fun. I know, it's such an unusual role for him, the know-everything Superman who's just sooooo much better than anyone else and doesn't mind letting people know. Quite a departure from his other roles as a know-it-all cadet (An Officer and a Gentleman), a know-it-all stockbroker (Pretty Woman), and a know-it-all reporter (Runaway Bride). Still and all, he turns in an engaging, appealing performance. It's not like he'll knock your socks off with his emoting; it's more like he's just kind of fun to watch. Linney, who's very talented, does a good job as well, although she would get an eerily similar role in 2005's The Exorcism of Emily Rose (reviewed on this site recently). In that film, she was the defense attorney who was trying to assert herself as a woman attorney while under the constant threat of job endangerment. Both movies had the theme of priests in peril; here, it's a murdered archbishop who might not have been an innocent anyway, and in the Emily Rose it's a priest accused of murder by neglect. Well, at least Linney's not being typecast. Probably the best aspect of the movie, though, is the emergence of Norton as a powerful on-screen presence. This was his first movie, but you'd never know it by his work here. He's not tentative, he's shifty, perfecting essaying his character's plight and innocence. A strong indication of things to come, as it turned out, as he's become one of America's finest thespians. Overall, Primal Fear is a decent yarn carried by strong performances, but the plot twists are nothing to write home about.",7.0,dfranzen70,2006/12/08,12,9

1519,Taxi Driver,dumb standard gun-story,"Unless I'm hopelessly not getting it, the plot suggests that do-it-yourself-justice, including death-penalty, is very cool and stylish. The ""hero"" (De Niro) is made as a figure to identify with [the viewer is put into the hero's point-of-view most of the time, and, more important, into the hero's mood all the time - the monotonous melancholic soundtrack (basically, solo-saxophone) reflects the hero's extreme loneliness, and loneliness is a feeling known to everybody], and the hero's fascist ideology (some people are 'dirt') is not questioned anywhere. The film glorifies violence and fascist ideology, and that's about most disgusting message I can think of, and not very original either. Every James-Bond does the same, I admit, but the difference is, that in case of James Bond, noone expects art, makers and viewers know, that a new James-Bond is going to be the same old entertainment via special effects, completely lacking a story apart from standard testosterone-phantasy. Taxi-driver is like James Bond minus the special effects. If the message actually should have been ""the hero is an asshole"", then the film is inane. If not, it's worse.

1520,Intermission,"Ireland's, 'Magnolia' with more laughs and less frogs.","Without much background information on Intermission I went along to the Edinburgh Film Festival yesterday without any expectations. I booked the tickets on the strength of the all-star cast (Colin Farrell, Kelly McDonald and Cillian Murphy, to name but a few) and sat down and waited to be entertained. 2 hours, and some very colourful language later, I was pleasantly surprised at how entertaining it actually was. Set in Dublin, Intermission is a tough comedy/drama about the interweaving lives of some very different characters who are all desperately trying to find love or hold onto love (think an Irish, more light-hearted Magnolia-without the ensemble sing along or raining frogs.) Working with a plot, loosely centred round a robbery, first-time director, John Crowley, ensures that the character's weaknesses are highlighted through their ongoing struggles to produce some genuinely touching scenes. The performances are all excellent, from Colin Farrell's portrayal of violent, young, thug, Lehiff, right down to his law-enforcing adversary, Detective Jerry Lynch (played to great comic effect by Colm Heaney.) This ensemble cast shines, partly due to their superb acting abilities, but also down to the hilarious dialogue (thanks to writer Mark O'Rowe). Each character has to face the harsh realities of life in this gritty tale of Irish urban life and the shrewd perceptions of the writer ensure that the film is seriously funny- the infamous Irish banter will have you laughing out loud. Every character is awarded a conclusion that they deserve, although it is important to point out that, in real life, things don't always tie up so neatly. Any negative comments, aside from the unrealistically happy ending, would be directed towards the fact that some of the smaller characters are a little under-developed (the supermarket manager for instance.) However, this is always a danger in ensemble pieces such as this. Each character in Intermission exposes the human flaws inside of us all and as well as being a very funny film is also very poignant. The witty observations on Irish life and human emotion, along with the excellent ensemble cast make this film a highly recommended piece of entertainment. 8 out of 10.",8.0,nurse_ratched,2003/08/20,6,2
1521,Spider-Man 2,Cool movie ! from l3ad BOy,"This is why they invented movies. It's a dazzling story of love, loss, adventure, courage, heartbreak, tough choices, and tender feelings with a rescue from a burning building, a runaway train, a world-class villain, and a really great kiss. It is smart and funny and touching and exhilaratingly entertaining. S2 has sensational special effects integrated with a first-rate script and outstanding performances to illuminate the characters and tell the story -- and to show us something about ourselves. But most of all, this is why they invented movies because director Sam Raimi knows how to make things MOVE. Few movies have so mastered motion. Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire) swoops through the skyscrapers. A train hurtles across a track that just abruptly stops. A car flies through the air. Raimi is all but re-inventing cinematic story-telling before our delighted eyes. In the first movie, we saw Peter Parker's joy in the powers he developed after being bitten by a radio-active spider. When his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) was killed because he failed to stop a thief, he resolved to devote his life to help people. And that meant no close attachments because anyone he cared about would be vulnerable to attack by bad guys who wanted to pressure him. As this movie opens, things are not going well for Peter. Even his Spidey powers can't get those pizzas delivered by the 30-minute deadline when there are people to save along the way. Aunt May's application for a loan to save her mortgage from being foreclosed has been turned down. He is having trouble in school because he doesn't have time to do the work. His best friend Harry (James Franco) is still angry because Peter won't tell him what really happened the night Spider-Man killed his father. Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), the girl he loves, is giving up on him because he can't tell her who he really is or how he really feels. He can't even do a load of laundry without making things worse. That Spider-man suit chafes. Spidey can't even sling those webs the way he used to. The last hors d'oeuvre at the party is always snatched away just as he reaches for it. Maybe it's time to quit. Harry introduces Peter to the brilliant scientist, Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina), whose devotions to his wife and his work are inspiring. Harry is financing the doctor's experiments with fusion energy, so complex and dangerous that they must be conducted with tentacle-like mechanical arms that are controlled by artificial intelligence. But in the grand hubris tradition of myths and comic books, the experiment goes terribly, tragically wrong and the doctor's wife is killed. The four artificial arms are fused to Octavius' spine. Devastated by the loss and overtaken by the arms which move like serpents in the garden of Eden, he becomes a villain known as Doc Ock, stealing what he needs to resume his experiments. But Harry controls one of those ingredients, and he says he will give it to Doc Ock in exchange for Spider-Man. Molina is brilliant in both incarnations. His kind Doctor Octavius has a glimmer of benign madness. And his Doc Ock shows us the tortured soul that cannot help being thrilled by power. The weakest part of the first movie was the villain, with his dopey mask and over-the-top monologue. But Molina's Doc Ock is a villain for the ages, a man who shows us his real face so we can feel the struggle for his soul. The comic book elements are all here, with spectacular fight scenes and teen-friendly existential themes. Peter has to struggle with feelings of isolation and not being understood or appreciated. He is aware of the irony of his working for justice for others when his own life is filled with people who judge him unfairly. One of the screenwriters was Michael Chabon, who wrote a Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about comic book creators called The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay, and his rich appreciation for the mythic appeal of the comic book tradition brings depth to the story. Spider-Man and Doc Ock have many parallels. Both were granted extraordinary powers through mutations caused by accidents in scientific experiments. Both struggle with their alternate identities, represented in visual terms by frequent use of reflections. Both struggle with devastating losses. In a nice moment that gently underlines and broadens what is going on with the characters, Peter watches Mary Jane perform in a production of The Importance of Being Earnest in a scene where Cecily talks to Algernon about his pretending to be someone he is not. And a street musician sings the Spider-Man song, at first a little tentatively and off-key but then, as Spidey re-discovers who he is, with more assurance, hitting the right notes. This is a sumptuous summer treat that succeeds on many levels. It is that rarest of treats, a popcorn pleasure with heart, soul, and insight. Families who enjoy this movie may also enjoy the original Spider-Man and other comic book movies like Superman and Batman. Adult viewers may enjoy Wonder Boys, another Michael Chabon movie starring Maguire.",9.0,jittakarns,2007/06/20,3,3

1524,Ferris Bueller's Day Off,A likable comedy that doesn't try too hard.,"It isn't easy to make a movie on adolescence. The attempt may backfire in more than one ways. ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" thankfully stays crisp till the end, a genre-defining film that manages to revive you with a fresh verve on a familiar concept. No, I'm not saying its the best film I've seen on the subject but it's a thoroughly enjoyable fare that wasn't aiming for that anyway. Or was it? Doesn't matter. It manages to charm in many ways, and that's the whole point. Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick) is a teenage miscreant who fakes an illness to skip school on a beautiful summer day. Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck), his best friend, decides to join him in his plans to spend a memorable albeit intuitive day. Ferris' girlfriend Sloane Peterson (Mia Sara) is also picked up by them from school right under the supervision of the dean, Edward Rooney (Jeffrey Jones), who is out to nail Ferris for his poor attendance record. As the gang spends the day roaming around the city, Rooney repeatedly tries to apprehend Ferris but to no avail. Ferris' sister, Jeanie (Jennifer Grey), jealous of her brother's ability to wriggle out of any tight situation, longs to catch him fooling around. The story revolves around how Ferris and his friends spend an entire day that is both unforgettable and life-changing. ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" starts off on a great note, with a few of the film's funniest scenes playing out in the first-half itself. Broderick sneaks into his character effortlessly, being charming and fascinating from the very beginning and never letting his character be someone you won't like. Apart from the many things that impressed me, I was most inspired by how director John Hughes made it seem all so familiar. I chuckled at how many of the scenes in the movie took me back to certain points in my life when I faced a similar situation, and when you're reminded of something like that in a movie, you know that the director has done his job well. The characters are endearing, likable and that helps when the film starts to slog after a while. Hughes has always been great at creating rascally characters who are affable enough to carry a parodic story to its end. ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" is no different. It doesn't even seek to try anything else other than delight you with its vigor and observations. And, in parts, it's pretty hilarious. When attempting a coming-of-age film, one should keep his indulgences in check. Though ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" targets the younger generation, I found it a tad too childish. And that's not entirely bad, but after a while, I found it difficult to invest into the characters. ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" is a corpus of the fantasies of an average teenager, which is also the reason why the touch of pragmatism is almost entirely abandoned. Hughes creates a world where nothing can go wrong for his protagonist, where everything is sorted out with absurd ease and a few clever pranks. The character of Ferris Bueller is a synecdoche, just a synecdoche. If you like him, you'll like the movie. But if you don't, you might find it more annoying than amusing. Me, I liked him when he first came on-screen but I found my likeness wearying as the story progressed. But your viewpoint about the him may differ. Broderick, in his most important role to date, infuses Ferris with charm and wit that gives the movie its legs. It's a candid performance and surely Broderick's best. Sara is absolutely gorgeous to look at and she brings a quiet confidence to her role. Ruck is fascinating as Cameron, and when I grew tired of Ferris' antics, I found myself looking forward to watching Ruck's elucidation of his character. He hands in a wonderfully nuanced performance and the best of the lot. ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" is a watchable film, supremely entertaining, a good-looking film with its heart in the right place. Though I was expecting it to really dig into the genre, and was disappointed when it chose to stay away from being too ambitious and played it safe instead, it's one of those films that delights in everything it does. And a movie like that is hard to come by.",6.0,advaitkamat,2013/08/14,11,6
1525,Hotel Transylvania,"Some jokes are forced, but an overall enjoyable film!","Hotel Transylvania stars: Adam Sandler, Andy Samberg, Selena Gomez, Kevin James and David Spade. It goes for approximately 90 minutes. It fails to deliver GREAT 3D moments although some could be classified as 'GOOD'. The first half of the movie is what is called 'Jokes Are Failing' Syndrome. Although they do crack in a couple of good laughs in the first half, majority don't live up to expectations that animations nowadays do. Too many slapstick moments and unnecessary forced jokes... NOTE TO FILM-MAKERS: If jokes are forced... Don't even bother with the joke! The movie has heart though, which kind of makes for it's first half. The second half however is fun, cool, funny and surprisingly a bit thrilling! It does have it's fun moments... I will admit. Although some of the 3D doesn't work I still found it to be a good animation... Is it the best animation of the year? NO WAY! But is it great as an animation? No, not really it is what I call 'A good animation if you just let your mind do nothing!' A B from me.",7.0,joe-is-sexy,2012/11/03,13,10

De Niro is just outstanding as Travis, and Scorsese is in top form too, only maybe rivaled by Goodfellas and The Wolf of Wall Street. It is not a action, crazy plot-twists, guy meets girl, happy ending kind of movie. What it is, is one of the best character studies and acting ever done. Something to identify with to the unindefiable, a study of what society does to people. A anti-hero bloody masterpiece.",9.0,punkadelic781,2020/10/30,7,7
1527,Moon,Cloning glimpses of sci-fi classics,"Compared to William Eubank's 2011 ""Love"", a sort of mega-clip ""inspired"" by Kubrick, Malick (and Aronofsky ?), Duncan Jones' 2009 ""Moon"" is clearly a better movie. It is also clearly more ""about something"" - not necessarily meaning this ""something"" is anything special or new. To quote James Berardinelli, "" 'Moon' illustrates a truism forgotten by Hollywood : the best science fiction films are about SOMETHING. This film does not feature explosions(...), endless mind-numbing chase sequences. Instead, it (...) respects the intelligence and attention span of the adult. (...) It is intelligent, thought-provoking material."" I quite agree with Mr. B., but his rating surprises me. To give a movie 3,5 stars out of 4 just for being ""about something"", respecting the intelligence of the adult and recycling ""thought-provoking material"" ? After all, I think there's more action in ""Moon"" than necessary, even including a couple of minor ""explosions"". It IS an action picture veiling itself in a ""thought-provoking"" toga - a patchwork in fact, not so far from Hollywood : here ""2001"" again, there ""Solaris"", next to it ""Silent Running"" (with a glimpse of ""The Prestige"", maybe ?). Ideas or images from these and others were cloned and skilfully put together (with addition of one talented actor in a sometimes - unintentionally, I suppose - caricaturing double-role) into a little sci-fi thriller, partly effective, but more manipulative than emotionally powerful, and in the predictable second half with cogs creaking in the screen writing department. It has been two days before watching ""Moon"" that I finished reading ""The Invisible Pyramid"" by the great Loren Eiseley. There's no actual astronaut (anti)hero in this book, and yet it tells so much more about us conquering Moons.... It costs the reader more than 97 minutes to get from beginning to end - but it's worth the effort !",5.0,leoperu,2013/03/24,19,9
1528,Taxi Driver,One of the greatest character studies to ever exist!,"After watching Joker, I had to watch Taxi Driver to see how Scorsese pulled off this character study and, I have to admit, this is one of the greatest character studies made. Taxi Driver follows Travis Bickle, a veteran who works as a taxi driver during the night. His disgust towards the filth of the city leads him on an unstable and violent journey. This film is a masterpiece. It's a film that fully engrosses you into its dark and filthy world as well as the perspective of one of the greatest characters to ever be created, Travis Bickle. You see the world through his eyes and are drawn towards him because of his fascinating personality and view of the world. His isolation and loneliness make you feel sympathetic towards him. Though they do spiral out of control as the film goes on. This is one of Scorsese's greats. It's shot extremely well especially the night scenes which are filled with atmosphere thanks to the fantastic score. I have to give a lot of credit to writer Paul Schrader for coming up with a truly disturbing and dark character study. Taxi Driver has so many memorable scenes and a large portion of them are due to Robert De Niro. This film belongs to him and he portrays Travis Bickle to the best of his ability. It's a masterful performance. Taxi Driver remains as a classic to this day. A film that says so much without actually saying it. The work from Scorsese, Schrader, De Niro and the rest of the team all make Taxi Driver a hypnotic experience.",10.0,ronakkotian,2020/08/05,8,7
1529,The Fault in Our Stars,Lack of substance,"Take out cancer and they are left with a hollow storyline. The movie is simply not believable to me.

Hazel's parents characteristics are contradictory too. They are portrayed to be protective of their daughter's well-being and safety but this conveniently dissipates when Hazel wanted to fly to Amsterdam with Gus. Sorry, I think this is not for a more realistic/mature audience, don't get me wrong, I love romantic films but this is sadly not my cup of tea.",1.0,felicia-yap,2014/08/22,77,37
1530,The Green Mile,A real Masterpiece...,"From the director of 'The Shawshank Redemption' {Frank Darabont} comes another masterpiece 'The Green Mile'. I absolutely loved it. Everything about this film stands out, be it acting, directing, cinematography and above all the story {adapted from the novel by Stephen King}. This film made me feel for the characters. I don't shed a tear watching a movie often but this made me cry pretty bad, it was that moving. With over 3 hrs you would think it was boring but believe me you won't move while watching. I can't gather enough superlatives to describe this movie. The dialogue in this film was simple yet deeply penetrating. Also has one of the best finishing lines EVER, ""But, oh, God...sometimes...the Green Mile seems so long.""{As someone said: A gift is not always a blessing} It was mesmerising, powerful, beautiful, brilliant and miraculous at the same time. It doesn't get better than this. I liked it more than 'Shawshank'...Now that says something since 'Shawshank' is in my Top 5 list. This will remain one of my all-time favourites for a long time.

1531,Moon,Very Good Sci-fi,"The future can be bright and the future can be bleak. It's an area that has always offered writers and filmmakers have often looked at and brought us some real classics. Here is Duncan Jones' homage to the great era of Sci-fi from of the 60s to the 80s. In Duncan Jones' vision of the future the world's energy needs are solved by mining the moon for helium-3 which can be used for nuclear fusion. Living on the dark side of the moon is Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell), who is coming to the end of a 3 year contract. He has lived in isolation, with only GERTY (Kevin Spacey), a robot who is programmed to serve him. His only contact from the outside world is video messages from his wife (Dominique McElligott) and the company. When one of the mining machines suffers some damage Sam goes out to fix it. However, after seeing images he crashes and wakes up after in the infirmary. GERTY tells Sam he is under orders no to let out the base and he has to trick the robot before being allowed out. In the open spaces of the moon Sam finds another version of himself. Both falls quickly into conflict, both arguing they are the real Sam and the other is a clone. But both also know something wider and darker is happening and they need to solve it before a rescue team arrive. Duncan Jones offers a strong and ambitious debut as a feature director. Sci-fi is not a genre that indie directors attempt and Jones does a wonderful job with a $5 Million budget. He shows that Sci-fi can be meaningful and doesn't resource to action and explosions to keep the audience's interest. It is thoughtful with themes of identity, isolation and the future of mankind. Jones keeps the mystery going and makes the audience exercise their mind whilst watching. Sam Rockwell has a tough job acting by himself, but he is a talented actor and does a excellently. He is allowed to show his range and can show a lot in his facial expressions. Kevin Spacey who is just a voice in this film offers a good impression of HAL 9000. Clint Mansell who composed an fantastic score for Requiem for a Dream has shown his musical talent again which a subtle, haunting score. Jones is an old fashion director, using models rather then CGI. It is refreshing to see in a modern film, is a lot more effective then CGI would have been on such a low budget. It reminds of films such as the original Star War films. Moon pays homage and has similarities to classic Sci-fi such as Alien, Blade Runner, Sunshine, 2001: A Space Odyssey (a must see) and 2010: the Year We Made Contact (a boring dud). Duncan Jones has a fine future ahead of him.",9.0,freemantle_uk,2009/08/04,80,51
1532,Blackfish,Blackfish Review,"That expression about learning something new, everyday, came into play for me today. I have heard a lot of hype regarding this new documentary, and seen that it was on Netflix. As I sat down to eat dinner, I turned it on just to see what it was about. I ended up watching the whole film, despite that originally not being the plan. I live very close to Toronto, where Ripley's Aquarium of Canada has just been put up. I have been wanting to take my girlfriend there for quite sometime now. However, what this documentary points out, is that the underwater creatures who will be living in places such as this aquarium are held in captivity. Taken away from family, and the ocean. Stuck in a jail of sorts. Forced to eat meals, and entertain, instead of living naturally, doing what they wish, when they wish. Blackfish takes a focus on orca's, or killer whales, who work in theme parks. The park used in the documentary is SeaWorld. I never actually put much thought into this before. Or even knew about any of the deaths caused by the killer whales who perform in the parks. Did you know that no killer whale in the wild has ever murdered a human? Only those held captive have. Did you know that killer whales, have the same life span as a human? Unfortunately, the whales held captive only live around thirty to fifty years at most. The main focus of this film is to fight against whales being held in captivity, and illustrate the consequences of it. Some of the testimonies by former SeaWorld trainers use worlds like barbaric or cruel, and claim that it will be something that will be frowned upon in future generations, to describe the whales captivity. One whale in particular, named Tilikum, gets the spotlight, for his role in the death of three people. The most recent one, in 2010, is the one discussed with the most detail. Fun, but not so fun in reality fact, Tilikum is still breeding, and performing today despite his murderous past. And I am not saying he should be punished for it, nor are the trainers in this film. What I am saying though, is that watching this documentary will open your eyes, and make you think about whether it can be justified or not, that SeaWorld insists on still using this troubled animal to breed and perform? The trainers interviewed in this film seemed to truly love the whales, and had grown close connections to them. It is remarkable to watch how one trainer who is in serious danger handles the situation of being attacked. I am not going to deny how horrible the SeaWorld owners look due the outlook in this documentary. The film makes a point to show how many lies, and possible cover ups are using in order for them to stay in business. How much is true, and how much is false? It seems like SeaWorld are not willing to tell us, as they declined to provide interviews for this documentary. And blamed the latest death by killer whale, on the victim herself. That is perhaps the only thing this film is missing. Hearing two sides of the story is always better than one, but since SeaWorld refuse to talk, we are unable to get it. With that aside, this was a very educational, yet an entertaining viewing, and it gave me a different outlook on how captive animals are treated. I watched it hours ago, yet images and thoughts are still stuck in my mind. If you love animals, or just want to learn something new, look no further. I cannot promise you will not be frustrated, angered, and full of emotion afterwards though. Gabrieila Cowperthwaite made her point clear as water with this well made piece of hard work.

And a film that just transports you to a totally unique cinematic universe. Great characters. Great character development. Great performances. Fantastic direction. Very well written. This is a great film. Hollywood just does not know how to do movies like this. Horror has a different name and a different face in Korea. And it is not the weak, sanitized Hollywood version of it.

1535,Horrible Bosses 2,Bends You Over A Barrel Of Laughs and Shows You The 50 States,"Horrible Bosses 2 picks up right where the original left off, joining Nick (Jason Bateman), Kurt (Jason Sudeikis) and Dale (Charlie Day) on another hair brained scheme. They are joined by some familiar faces, Jennifer Aniston, Kevin Spacey and Jamie Foxx as well as some new characters played by Chris Pine and Christoph Waltz. This time our guys find themselves involved in a kidnapping plot, where similar to the Big Lebowski the kidnapping details come secondary to big laughs. Bateman, Sudeikis and Day show us they are a comedy trio as strong as the original Stooges. Yet they have the endurance to push it to a second film and with any luck, beyond. Having recently sat through the molestation of my childhood favorite comedy in Dumb and Dumber To, I needed to be reminded of how occasionally Hollywood gets it right. Like in this movie and 22 Jump Street; a film I feel is as much on par, getting the same level of fresh laughs. I just love a good comedy, enough to subject myself to the long shot of an enjoyable sequel. Like a battered wife I went back to all three Hangover films. They will change, they will get better, I promise. Never did. The writer and director of Horrible Bosses 2 Sean Anders, was one of the many writers called on to fix the Dumb and Dumber To script. I assume he saved all his good ideas for HB2. And with a cast as great as this, from what I can assume are genuinely hilarious actors all at the top of their game. Face it Jim Carrey, the torch needs to be passed. What works so well about HB2 is it does not try to recreate the original, shot for shot, plot for plot. If fans wanted to see the exact same film they would rent Horrible Bosses 1. The formula in HB2 is they take the brilliant dynamic of the guys, bring back the hilarious side characters and up the stakes with some new blood. This film has quotability, re- watchability and with any luck a fun filled franchise that can continue to generate great laughs. Or know when to quit when its ahead.

1537,Moon,Utterly Fantastic and Inspired,"Go see this movie! I've been lucky enough to have an opportunity to see this movie down here at SXSW and I am the better for it. You don't really stumble upon many riveting, independent, sci-fi films that look beautiful(let alone don't contain aliens and space magic) and capture major emotional themes successfully. Moon accomplishes this, and with very little CGI at that. Sam Bell is an astronaut working for a corporation on the far side of the moon. His job? Maintaining a lunar facility and the automated machines which are harvesting the moon's surface for Helium 3. The harvested material is then sent back to Earth to use as energy. Sam is on the very last leg of a three year contract and is quite anxious to return to his wife and daughter. Barring any incidents, Sam will be able to leave his solitude. But something does go wrong. That said, tremendous acting by Sam Rockwell carries this film - mainly because he is basically the only person in the movie. I'm not talking about Cast Away meets the moon This film explores loneliness much deeper than that, and with much more emotion as well. Luckily for us there are no pieces of sports equipment on which the lead dotes, but instead we're blessed with a monotonous talking robot(voiced by Kevin Spacey) reminiscent of Hal from 2001 notoriety. I advise that people go see this film, not only to support Duncan, the director, and Sam, but also to explore to possibilities of space and the humanity of loneliness.

1538,Crash,"Preposterous, full of itself, and just not that good","This movie has some very powerful moments and good acting. I'm not denying this. But it had moments that were so poorly thought through, it made the movie simply suck as a whole. Sorry to use the high-falutin' term PREPOSTEROUS, but that's what it is. Unfortunately, it begins with the first scene, where two carjackers are talking about how they're being viewed as- well, crooks. The double irony is not what I take issue with. What's incredibly stupid - so stupid that even punk-ass carjackers wouldn't do this -is that they hung out in a diner for an hour in the same neighborhood before committing a felony crime. Thus, collecting dozens of witnesses who'd be able to identify them. I'm no carjacker, but a tiny bit of common sense says you don't want to be noticed before committing a crime. But there it is, because it advances the ""story"". And Big Statement. Once you have something so incredibly stupid jammed into a script that purports to be ""real"" JUST to make your Big Point - folks, that's called hackwork. Or how about one of the closing scenes, where the director stares at a burning car, then calls his wife on the cell phone? Gee, wasn't it as few hours earlier that his wife nearly got blown to bits in a explosive car wreck? So, does loving husband rush home? No. Guess it made a deeper scene this other way, the way it was shot. Oh, okay. Big Statement. C'MON!! I mean C'MON!!! Too stupid to accept. And it was the preposterous moments like that spoiled the rest of the film. Otherwise, it would be ""just okay"" anyway. Because- I live in LA, and what I saw in this movie was a view of Los Angeles sprung from a state-of-the-art laptop somewhere up in the multi-million-dollar homes of the Hollywood Hills, from a mind of an aloof armchair liberal. The writer had an agenda, rather than any sense of LA's reality and real vibe--and worse, the writer seemed to have no damn common sense whatsoever. Well-meaning try, but not a classic, not even all that good. Industry folks can sometimes be too much like dogs licking their lowers. It's about LA, it purports itself to be deep and meaningful. Naturally, the Industry loves it, because they want to seem deep and meaningful, too. It's self-important hackwork tripe like this that gives LA its shallow reputation.

1539,Moon,"This was terrible, let down by poor story and a lame attempt at psychodrama","I was expecting to really like Moon, an indie movie with a sci-fi setting and a reputation as a return to the meditative hard sci-fi classics of the 1970's. Even half an hour in I was still holding out hopes that it would prove to be le gem that it looked it could be. Eventually, as the unconvincing and tedious psychological posturing dragged on, without any depth or emotional effect I became resigned to the reality that this one was a stinker. It is a stinker. The denouement was both predictable and implausible. There's absolutely no good reason to construct a vast conspiracy involving clones for a mining operation on the moon. The whole basis of the plot seems utterly pointless and silly. A terrible movie, not good scifi at all.",1.0,draoi99,2013/01/01,42,16
1540,The Fault in Our Stars,The Fault in Our Stars,"I saw the trailer for this movie, obviously it was marketed as a big tearjerker movie, the title comes from a quote from Julius Caesar by William Shakespeare, ""The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves, for we are underlings"", it basically means that the fault is in the lead characters stars, I hoped for something worth my time. Basically teenager Hazel Grace Lancaster (Divergent's Shailene Woodley) lives in Indianapolis, she has terminal thyroid cancer that has spread to her lungs. Her mother Frannie (Laura Dern) believing her to be depressed urges to attend a weekly cancer patient support group to make friends with people going through the same thing. There Hazel meets charging teenager Augustus ""Gus"" Waters (Baby Driver's Ansel Elgort), he lost his leg from bone cancer, but has since apparently been cancer-free, they bond at his house over their hobbies. They both agree to read each other's favourite book, Hazel recommends An Imperial Affliction, a novel about a cancer-stricken girl named Anna that parallels her experience, and Augustus gives Hazel Counter Insurgence. They keep in touch via text over the weeks that follow and grow closer, Gus expresses frustration when finishing the book, having an abrupt ending (it ends in the middle of a sentence), Hazel tells that the mysterious author Peter Van Houten (Willem Dafoe) retreated to Amsterdam after the book's publication, he has not been heard from since. Weeks later, Gus tells Hazel he has traced Van Houten's assistant, Lidewij (Lotte Verbeek), Hazel corresponds with Van Houten by email, she writes wanting to find out more about the novel's ambiguous ending, Van Houten replies that he is only willing to answer her questions in person. Hazel asks her mother if she can travel to Amsterdam to visit him, but Frannie refuses because of financial and medical difficulties, Gus suggests she uses her Make-A-Wish Foundation ""cancer wish"", but she has already used it to go to Disney World. Gus and Hazel go on a picnic date and begin to fall in love, he surprises her with tickets to Amsterdam, there is a medical setback, but Hazel's doctors allow the trip, they expect that she will soon become incapable of doing anything at all. Hazel and Gus arrive in Amsterdam, they have reservations at an expensive restaurant, paid for by Van Houten, during the meal, Gus confesses his love for Hazel. The following afternoon, they meet Van Houten at his house, but are shocked to find he is an alcoholic, Lidewij paid for the trip and the dinner without his knowledge, angered he taunts Hazel for seeking answers, and belittles her medical condition. Hazel leaves, utterly distraught, Lidewij invites them to go sightseeing to make up for their ruined experience, the three visit the Anne Frank Museum, where Hazel struggles up the stairs. Gus and Hazel spend that night together in their hotel and have sex for the first time, the next day Gus tells her that his cancer has returned and spread throughout his body and is terminal, Hazel is heartbroken, expressing how unfair life can be. Returning to Indianapolis, Gus' health worsens, he is taken to the ICU and realizes he is close to death. Gus invites his blind best friend Isaac (Nat Wolff) and Hazel to his pre-funeral, where they deliver eulogies that they have both prepared, Hazel tells him she would not trade their short time together for anything. Gus dies eight days later, Hazel is astonished to see Van Houten at the funeral, he tells her that Gus had demanded he attend his funeral to make up for the spoiled trip. Van Houten tells her that his novel is based on the experiences of his daughter Anna, who died at a young age from leukemia, he gives a piece of paper, she screws it up and asks him to leave. Later, talking with Isaac, Hazel learns that Gus had asked Van Houten to help him write a eulogy for her, she retrieves the screwed-up paper, it is Gus writing about accepting his death and about his love for her. She lies on her back on her lawn looking up at the stars, smiling as she remembers Augustus and says: ""Okay"", they're special way of saying ""I love you"". Also starring True Blood's Sam Trammell as Michael Lancaster, Ana Dela Cruz as Dr. Maria, Randy Kovitz as Dr. Simmons, David Whalen as Gus' Dad and Milica Govich as Gus' Mom. Woodley gives a charming performance, whilst constantly wearing the breathing tubes, Elgort is endearing despite some cheesy dialogue, they are a believable doomed couple, obviously it is full of sentimentality and mushiness, and manipulative bits that try to draw tears, but it is also witty and amusing in the right places, it's not a bad romantic drama.

1541,Detachment,about being significant and to give significance to other,"This movie is beautiful! I made pauses while watching it, because I wanted to prolong watching as much as possible. I was so full of emotions that I needed to take breaks of it. Usually I don't like animations through the movie, nor the false documentary part, but in this movie it was interwoven so good. The movie is touching, happy and sad at the same time. It felt so sincere. I thought that it would be one of many movies about education and charismatic teacher who comes and makes everything good.But it's really different then any of such movies I have ever watched. There are no bad characters, everyone tries to go through the day the best way they know, and do as much as they can. They are brave and week at the same time. It was very inspiring and I think that creator team should be proud. I think that I'm gonna watch this movie every time I feel bed or lonely. The only this that I wish that was different, and that, to me, doesn't follow the whole movie atmosphere was last scene. Although the end brings change in the main characters life, and its basically bright, the last scene shows absolute loneliness, lost of others, lost of hope. It is not kind of movie that should get ""flowers and butterflies"" last scene,but I would prefer scene that has some Others in it...because that's what movie is about - about being significant and to give significance to someone other - about that existential layer of love and connectedness to other.",10.0,daneejela,2012/11/20,8,6
1542,The Green Mile,Emotional pornography,"I use that expression cautiously and deliberately. This film hides its massive illogic and implausibility behind emotional manipulativeness and cheap tear-jerker tricks. Fans of the film who may be reading this will naturally object as though I am invalidating their tears. But please consider that your tears were coaxed out by a crude setup. Some complaints: 1. Where on earth would one find such compassionate prison guards? To quote Mahathir Muhammad, ""Either one gets callouses on one's heart or you bleed to death."" 2. In the South of 1935, not even the white liberals would treat a black man with such dignity, let alone prison guards. 3. How would a patrician white woman thank an illiterate and dirty black man for saving her life? With a hug? 4. Once John Coffey sees Wild Bill, why would his only words be,""He's a bad man!""? Why did he say nothing? 5. After visiting Coffey's lawyer, why did Paul say nothing to any legal authority? 6. The execution of Delacroix was annoyingly unrealistic. A botched execution (and there have been many) would never be anywhere nearly as gruesome. 7. Finally, and this is the point at which I hated the movie, there were MANY opportunities for the guards to get Coffey's case re-opened, even if he didn't cooperate. But that would have turned it into a courtroom drama, not a religious-like story of redemption, suffering and eternal punishment.",4.0,cliff-19,2001/08/29,43,15
1543,Spider-Man 2,The best 'Spider-man' movie of the three,"With a great story, great villain, and even more drama and action than the first 'Spider-man,' the second Spidey installment thrilled its viewers across the globe, and deservedly so. Doc Ock was a fantastic villain choice, and really is a nemesis for Spider-man. The action scenes, though heavily relied on CGI, are fantastic, and are OK on being CGI-heavy since they looked so realistic and so cool. On a personal, internal level, Peter Parker accepts who he needs to be as a superhero, rather than shunning the responsibilities that he has been given. Mary Jane is torn between two men, a recently-returned astronaut and Pete. Her fateful decision at film's end directly follows Pete's exciting last encounter with Doc Ock. 'Spider-man 2' is definitely one of the three best superhero movies of all time, and arguably the best. 3.5 stars/4",9.0,Rcwilkinson123,2008/02/21,3,3
1544,Primal Fear,One of the greatest thrillers ever brought to the screen!,"The film stars Richard Gere and Edward Norton. Need I say more? These dudes are some of the best actors alive and are totally awesome! Edward Norton not winning an Oscar was a joke. He gave the best performance of the year. I personally think he out-did Gere. Norton was a nobody at the time, never been in any movie before, yet he was better than the legendary Richard Gere. Norton's portrayal is one of the best in history! Gere plays a hotshot, slick lawyer named Martin Vail who loves when the spotlight shines on him and loves winning and does not care who he defends. He decides to defend an alter boy named Aaron (Norton) who is accused of brutally murdering the archbishop. As Martin dives deeper into the case, he discovers some shocking secrets about the case and his client as his chances of winning deteriorate. Throughout the whole film, there are curve-balls, twists and questions that will leave you hungry for more. 4/4",10.0,powermandan,2012/05/07,12,8
1545,Ferris Bueller's Day Off,Smile and Nod,"Author's Forewarning: I am making many comparisons between this and The Breakfast Club because the two represent John Hughes' best work. Forget Sixteen Candles and Weird Science, if you cannot handle such constant comparisons, get a life and start thinking. Matthew Broderick has never grown out of the image he created with Ferris Bueller's Day Off, he never will. His poise is correct for the character, proving that John Hughes can make some proper casting decisions. His wise-ass comments are not as clever as Judd Nelson's in TBC, but raise Ferris' character level beyond Bender's. Alan Ruck and Jeffrey Jones are the real saving graces of this film. Anthony Michael Hall was smart to turn down the part of Cameron because it would be out of his line and, while Ruck never went onto anything better, he did make his declaration here. Jeffrey Jones' Rooney is absolutely in line because, perhaps, he is the only one sans Broderick to understand the overwhelming parody of the movie. I am extremely thankful that Hughes didn't use Molly Ringwald (again) because she is unable to expand on his paper-thin roles. Mia Sara is no better, but at least she has fewer lines. Hughes is more artistic here (in an MTV fashion) and Broderick knows how to exploit this change to his advantage. The editing is both efficient and superior to TBC, but here it is merely editing for the sake of comedy and pacing whereas TBC tried developing character. The script, conventional Hughes as it is (see my Breakfast Club comment), has some key points that both age it and retain its value at the same time. Though Hughes' movies are for teens, their level of credibility ranges from innocent (as in this case) to insulting (Weird Science anyone?), thus I find TBC to be more insightful in the long run. Ferris Bueller has its moments, but there are no long-standing messages to take away other than Cameron's fits. Unfortunately, since Ferris' world is so focused on youth, the distant world of adults is falls into the similar problems of TBC except here it is merely for laughs. There are no brief moments of self-discovery for Ed Rooney. Overall, I give this a tied recommendation level with TBC due to shifts in tone and ideas, but recommended this for anyone between 14-22 years old. 3.5 out of 5 stars. Isn't high school all about malarkey anyway?",10.0,Angry_Arguer,2003/08/03,12,7
1546,Crash,Contrived and propagandistic,"I love when Hollywood intentionally gives us a good contrivance. What else is it when you go see a movie like ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" or ""Buckaroo Banzai?"" These are films which are made to be extreme works of fiction and, as viewers, it is part of the experience to suspend disbelief. Then, of course, there are films like ""Crash."" Films which are no less contrived, no less fictional, no less fantasy, yet dare us to suspend disbelief because they are meant to be perceived as some sort of Brechtian reality. As if a pastiche of LA; the very sediment of America as if it were reduced in some great crucible,is placed before us and we as audience, can participate in seeing (in almost a voyeuristic fashion) what REALLY GOES ON-- WHAT RACE RELATIONS IN America ARE REALLY ALL ABOUT. No, I am not some right wing nut. Far FAR from it. But this movie is so surreptitious in the manner in which it portrays pure fiction as flesh and blood fact. It is, as I stated in the title, almost propagandistic. It is a big, unforgiving lie! No, I do doubt nor do I deny racial tensions and significant racial problems in America. But with ""Crash"" we get to be force fed Paul Haggis' world-view and we are meant to be shocked and disturbed at the cruel, unfair world we live in. But unlike being force-fed most things (like, ironically, Haggis), ""Crash"" can subvert you, and slyly make you a believer in this creation-as-truth (which is as real as Disneyland). There is nothing new in his directorial style. It has been done before and more successfully in countless other films. But I am not a believer. I have not been brainwashed. This is an ultra-contrived, overly-crafted, stylized work of fiction. And, as such, it is not very good. I know many of you feel otherwise. But this is not the perspective of the black man, the Iranian man, the Korean women, etc. It is a white-man's dream of them. It's a film to be viewed from the comfortable suburbs, with a two-car garage and a hefty mortgage. It is from there that you can really feel the angst and oppression of those who are dispossessed. From that perspective you can be disturbed and see the hardness of this film. From there you can see it all really is true. Because what else is there in that environment to contradict the ""facts"" of the film? ""Crash"" is a creative, formulaic, FICTIONAL film that stabs its ideology at the guilty white middle class who embraced it. Fiction presented as fact. One world view disguised as many. It's contrived. It's artificial. What's most disturbing about it is the middle-class masses who imbibed this nonsense and set it as dogma in their minds. Oh, by the way, it's a bad movie too.

1547,Blackfish,Blackfish is an intriguing and heart wrenching film,"Blackfish is a great documentary film that portrays the repercussions of restraining killer whales that was once free, to captivity in Sea World. Also, the results of inhumane treatment towards the Orcas were portrayed. The Director of the film, Gabriela Cowperthwaite, depicts these repercussions through the insight of various former Sea World trainers and marine animals' experts. The interviewees provided an argument that the Sea World facilities and treatments toward the whales were completely inhumane and would eventually cause the Orcas to display aggressive behavior. The whales displayed aggressive behavior toward people that tried to interact with them. However, Sea World argued that the incidents caused by the whales, were completely the faults of the trainers and not the whales. The evidence provided in the film definitely proved otherwise. One particular Orca provided the most evidence out of all of the whales. The one particular whale was Tilikum. Tilikum is a 12,000 pound Orca that was captured at a very young age. He portrayed serious aggressive early on in his life; which led him to be moved to Sea World in Orlando. He was the cause of the deaths of three people. The death of Dawn Brancheau was the most famous case because of her popularity to the general public. Also, her death was filmed, but was soon removed from the internet. Exceptional insight was given to give some sort of reasoning behind Tilikum's madness. Of course, the main reason was the fact he was being held in captivity for years and forced to do tricks day in and day out. The former trainers and employees provided mind boggling information about Sea World. Some trainers experienced heart racing encounters with some of the Orcas. However, The Sea World Corporation decided to stick with the argument that the Orcas aren't at fault. Seeing that Sea World decided to stick with this ridiculous arguments, shows that corruption and irresponsibility were definitely at play. The way Blackfish surrounded this back-and-forth argument between former employees and the Sea World Corporation, provides a heart breaking film. Anybody that's concerned or even curious about the treatment and well-being of animals being held in captivity, should really watch this captivating and eye-opening film. Not only does the film provide in-depth information and a well-grounded narrative, it also depicts archive footage of the Orcas' performance and personal interviews. The viewer would be intrigued by the set-up of the footage portraying the trainers enjoying the company of the Orcas. The voice of those trainers explaining their opinion about Orcas while watching the archive footage, gives a somewhat contradiction. The footage shows the trainers, in some situations, enjoying the Orcas, while the opinions of the former trainers state otherwise. It gives the viewer a feeling of realization and disgust. Just hearing the criticizing of Sea World, will bring you to a point of hating the corporation and leave you not wanting to see any place that hold animals in captivity. Moreover, Cowperthwaite utilizes emotional footage of the communication between the Orcas to capture the intelligence and feelings that the Orcas hold. Also, Cowperthwaite shows the emotional connections instilled between the Orcas and trainers, which provide an insight to how the trainers and employees of Sea World might have felt when they realized that Sea World doesn't care about how the animals are treated. They just want the money. Overall, the film is informational, yet heart wrenching. The overall use of archive footage, interviews, and primary information, provides a well-grounded and exceptional film. The film is well put together and will keep you intrigued throughout the whole film. Even if documentaries might not be interesting to you, you should give this wonderful documentary a chance.",10.0,housejohn-08825,2015/10/18,3,3

1549,The Fault in Our Stars,True to the book,"I read the book several months ago and have been anxious for the movie. So this grandmother went with her 16 yr old grandson who had also read the book. We are both happy with the adaptation. The story of two teens with cancer who meet in a support group for teens, neither want sympathy and both knowing they will die - want to live life. They exchange books and because of the ending of one and the questions they have - they email the author in Amsterdam. Because he had not used up is 'wish' they end up being able to go there and have the chance to meet the author. Willam Defoe portrays the alcoholic author so well - you do not like him. Gus also tells Hazel something he has been keeping from her. Gus and Hazel have their ups and downs and knowing their time may be limited their love is fresh and true - and presented so well. All the acting is good, the sets, the music -and there is a lot of music but I did not notice most of it - a sign of a good movie score. I volunteer in a hospice facility and it was so good to see the presentation of their cancer as real. Their feelings of what they are going thru as real.

This is box-office fodder - nothing wrong with that - just that we have always expected something more of French cinema. But commercial hits can also pave the way for art by providing the necessary cash flow, and we can only hope that French cinema will not entirely disown its great cultural heritage.

However, the reason for it could only be felt if one watches this movie. It's so heart-stirring and thought provoking that it made my mind cry with no tears. I live ten thousand miles away from America, but the theme of the movie(Love, Children, educational system, parenthood, childhood, adulthood, teachers and above all the struggle of life) is so relevant and transcends boundaries. Adrien Broody is an amazing actor and with this movie, as become one of my favorite actors. He is one of those very rare actors who can emote so effortlessly. The sadness and melancholy that he expresses is so natural that he should be given a award for the saddest face in Hollywood. The rest of the cast is equally good. The soundtrack of the movie is so congruous to the movie that at times the background score will move you.

1552,Spider-Man 2,The best Spiderman movie,"I'm a big fan of comic books and comic book conversation when done right. Spiderman is on of the best comic best to be made and is an important cultural figure and important to Marvel Comics. The first and the third films were both good, the first was an introduction and the third really underused Venom. Spiderman 2, like X-Men 2 is best in the film franchise. Spiderman is meant to be more family friendly and a little serious then say the X-Men films and Batman Begins, but is still very fun and avoids going down the camp or comic root which is easy to do. Spiderman 2 takes place after the first film and the credits give you a brief run down of what happened. Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is struggling in his life, he had rejected the love of his life, Mary-Jane Watson (Kirsten Durst), his friendship with Harry Osborn (James Franco) is strained because he believed Spiderman killed his father and Peter wouldn't tell him anything. Peter is also struggling at university, unable to keep a hold of a double-life, suffering money troubles and had just been sacked as a pizza boy. Harry offered him the chance to meet with Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) which Peter takes up. However during a demonstration of his invention his gets killed and the metal arms that he used to control the invention before fused with his body. From then on he became Dr. Octopus and sets out to make money so he could re-build the machine. At the same time Peter's relationship with Mary-Jane is getting worse, he missed the play she was starting in and then he finds out she became engaged with John Jameson, J. Jonah Jameson's son. However, as the film continues Mary-Jane doubts Peter's earlier claims that he wasn't in love with her and starts to develop feelings herself. Peter also starts loosing his powers and he starts to doubt whether to be Spiderman anymore. This was confirmed when he spoke with a doctor and then with his Uncle Ben in a dream. However, without Spiderman crime starts to raise in New York and Peter relies that he can't hide from his destiny. The reason why this film is so good was because of Sam Raimi's director. He focus' on the psychology of Peter/Spiderman and looks at relationships with many characters. He shows how a double life could take its toll on a person. There are also issues of sacrifice that Peter had to face and the guilt he suffered from his Uncle Ben being murdered. The CGI and the special effect had improvement from the film and they are stunning. There are great sequence in the movie such as Spiderman vs. Doc Ock on the church and the fight on the subway train. Raimi also has good casting instincts. Maguire is good at playing Peter as a bit of a geek and the films have made him an A-Lister. The other opinion was Jack Gyllenhaal and he possibly would have played Peter as a man who was a little more cooler and less of a social outcast. Durst and Franco had also improved as actors from the first film and you care for them more, especially Durst and I personally think she looks betters as a red-head then blonde. Molina is good as Doc Ock and shows that Raimi is able to get a stage actor like him to be in an action film like this. There are also regular like Rosemary Harris as Aunt May who is a good casting choice and the best of all was J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, playing the character just right and looks like him as well and if you ever seen Simmons in the programme Oz then you will see how good an actor he is because it will special you when you find out what character he plays. Raimi also got the mix of fantasy and reality just right and doesn't go silly with it like some versions of Spiderman have done.",10.0,freemantle_uk,2008/05/06,9,7

1554,Goodfellas,Scorsese's best,"Goodfellas makes you feel like you are watching guys that you know or knew. To this day, I have a friend that still talks like Jimmy Two Times. He always says things like ""Nice Nice"" and that was just a background piece in Goodfellas. But that is the point, all that is background is just as important as the main players and locales. It all paints us a perfect picture of what mob life must be like. And with all due kudos to The Godfather, but there is no other film that has ever made mob life look so real and feel so tangible the way Goodfellas does. To say that Joe Pesci is the best part of this film would be to discredit the rest of the cast, but at the same time, you have to mention him in some way. His portrayal of Tommy is haunting. Here is a man that is so insecure and wants to be the top dog, the made man so bad that he can't decipher between what is a joke and what is disrespect towards him. Of course the scene in question is when he shoots a common boy for telling Tommy to screw himself after he shot him in the leg. You would think the guy has a right to let off a little steam and vent, but Tommy is always looking for the diss. He is always looking to find some hidden gesture from someone that is putting him down. Even at the beginning when he is getting on Henri in the now famous "" You're a funny guy "" scene. He is kidding with Henri but deep down inside he is angry with him, you can see it and feel it. Joe Pesci gave the performance of his career and he richly deserved to win best supporting actor that year. The story and script by Pileggi is sheer inside brilliance. You can feel the inside observations that no one can have except for a guy that spent his whole life on the inside. They ring so true and they get into your blood. From scenes like the fat guy running around delivering messages to the other mob guys because he doesn't like to use the phone to the scene when Henri, Jimmy and Tommy have Billy Bats in the trunk but they stop off at Tommy's moms house for a late night dinner of pasta and such. They also have to borrow a sharp knife to finish off the guy in the trunk, but to his mom they have to cut off the hoof of a dear that hit the car. And the scene where Tommy does kill the young kid for joking with him and then Jimmy gets mad at him, not for killing the guy but because he doesn't want to dig a hole tonight. There are so many tiny observations in Goodfellas that give it the authenticity it has. And it is a film that stays with you for years to come. I think this is Scorcese's best film and although I understand and accept why the academy awarded Dances With Wolves the accolades it did, if this film would have swept the Oscars that year, no one would have been surprised. It is a landmark film and I think it is one of the best films ever made. And again, taking no credit away from Coppolla's Godfather epics, but this gets inside the mafia on a deeper level. It goes one step beyond what Coppolla gave us, and for that Goodfellas should be remembered as the best film about gangsters ever made.",10.0,baumer,1999/09/16,151,87

The beginning/introduction was fine and even sparked my interest for a little while but after that, it became clear to me that two of the main characters were made into total idiots. A little stupidity in a comedy movie is okay but this went way, way too far. All of the film's humour is centered around the two guys making ignorant mistakes, shouting loudly for no reason and not listening to each other. It becomes more and more annoying as the film goes on. I usually enjoy raunchy series and films but when the *entire* plot and all of the jokes are based on sheer idiocy, that is just too much.

I think the narrator, the necessity for him, let alone the very presence of him, is a weakness in the movie, but in the skeem of a really fine film like this, it's a minor mistake. The viewer, then, by the narrator's narration, understands that some water has flowed under the bridge since the last scene in the actual story. Tho many write that this movie is ""about a substitute teacher"", one who has trouble staying put wherever, I don't think it's about that. It's about community, community as it manifests, permeates, and undermines or supports a school in it's midst. It's about fighting indifference, violence, chaos--entropy--by the simple act of caring.",8.0,mailjohnw,2013/03/14,3,3
1558,The Wailing,Surprising,"I expected this to be a slow pace,d very atmospheric horror film. Instead, I was surprised by how crazy and intense it is. It never really allows you to completely wrap your head around it because it is constantly pulling the rug from under you. The cast does a great job from verging in both drama, horror, and even comedy, which the film is able to balance with the other genres very well, for the most part. Because of that the film sometimes feels a little messy and a little jumbled in its very ambitious aims, and as a result it suffers. I wouldn't call it a great film, but I do recommend it simply for the sheer effort and ambition on display here. Certainly a horror film to remember.",,Red_Identity,2017/01/06,30,23

1560,Hotel Transylvania,Obnoxious dude-isms,"I don't know if Sandler helped sink this by mere association or what. The humor is broad. The message against prejudice is as heavyhanded as in Brave, but simply blurted out to us. The computer animation is typical, nothing to see—both horror-themed stop motion films of this year trump it with ease. The horror sketchbook feel is much better captured in Frankenweenie, by a filmmaker who actually loves the stuff. ParaNorman has the fancy characters and dazzle for the kids, but offers us a richer, more visual experience on the same subject. By contrast to those other films that show creators immersed in at least some aspect of their work, this gives the feel of a mass-marketed product—never more obvious than in the songs performed, ranging from punk rock to club music. The logic here is something for everyone.",,chaos-rampant,2013/01/15,9,4
1561,Horrible Bosses 2,"22 Jump Street, This Is Not","""In strict logic, it's hard to see how a sequel would be possible, but they'll find a way. You wait and see.""- Roger Ebert. That was from the late Roger Ebert's review of Horrible Bosses which turned out to be prophetic. These unnecessary sequels have clearly become an epidemic in Hollywood. A month from now we'll get ""Hot Tub Time Machine 2"" at it doesn't even have John Cusack in it. Look, I really enjoyed the first film, but this is definitely a sequel none of us asked for and does not provide enough to justify it's existence. The antagonist in this film isn't even a Horrible Boss, he's a wealthy businessman who steals the protagonist's invention to get richer. Regarding the plot, it involves a kidnapping, car chases, very little we haven't seen before. Jennifer Aniston returns and did what she did best in the original film playing a sex-crazed Nymphomaniac. Kevin Spacey returns as a cameo in prison and he did the best with what he was given. However another two-time Academy Award winner Christoph Waltz plays the antagonist and I thought his talent was completely wasted. The strength from the original film was the chemistry between Jason Bateman, Charlie Day, and Jason Sudekis, which was present here and it both provided occasional laughs and kept the movie going. Though most of the humor was gross-out sex gags, which got a lot of laughs in the theater but at the end of the day were pretty uninspired. The film's credits are a long blooper reel (like in the original) which I didn't have the patience to sit through. As the sequel in lacks the self awareness of ""22 Jump Street"", a film that proved it's worth as both a sequel and a stand alone film. That film brought out the best of the actors and even gave them more to work with. Just compare the end credits of ""22 Jump Street"" and ""Horrible Bosses 2"", you can see what sets these movies apart.",3.0,rwatt92,2014/11/30,36,15

1563,Interstellar,Leaves you wondering,"A lot has been said and heard about this movie but none of it comes even close to the experience of watching it. It has all the elements of a Nolan movie and just like in all of his other movies he decides to go a bit further. This time, he went a little too far. The story behind the movie has it's flaws. There really is no explanation of what happened/is happening. Instead you are given fragments in the first half of the movie hoping one will put all the pieces together. All in all, the first part seems a bit rushed and leaves you wondering if more could have been told. But, since the real story is not why the travel is necessary but the travel itself once the crew is off, the story really kicks in. The main part of the movie gives a great ride, pumps your blood with adrenaline from time to time and gets you emotional pretty often. The problem I personally had was that the story taking place simultaneously on Earth was less shown than I expected. A different approach was expected but that did not stop Chastain from giving the best role in the movie. The last part of the movie is dynamic and filled with problems real people would have if found in a situation like that. But the explanation given at the very end was a bit to much for me. I heard that this was called ""the most scientifically accurate movie"" and that physicist around the world fought over the fact was that true or not. Nevertheless, way too much theoretical physics in the end. Since I love SF movies I am willing to look past the over- the-top science part, but what really got to me was that it was predictable. From the very moment I saw a black hole in the movie I put two and two together and that kinda ruined it for me a little. Regarding the acting, as I said before, Chastain gave the most powerful performance in the movie. She doesn't have much screen time, but she sure knows how to use it. The two that actually lead the movie - McConaughey and Hathaway were brilliant. McConaughey did a little better job handling the emotions of a father with the responsibilities of a team leader and the savior of mankind. His performance was outstanding. Hathaway was good, decent, without a single word that can be said against her, but for a movie like this, that is almost completely on the shoulders of the actors, she should have done more. The others did a good job, particularly Casey Affleck who's character was a grand comparison to Chastain's. The music given it was done by the mastermind Hans Zimmer was spectacular. Just the right notes, just the right timing, just the right music. His understanding of what movies should sound like is amazing. All in all, Interstellar is a magnificent movie. It is a type of movie Nolan does best. It has all the elements of being a classic like Kubrick's 2001: a space odyssey, it comes really close to being the new space odyssey, and it will not perish with time. Still, this might be a bit too much for the average moviegoer, a lot has to be digested here, it is not a simple or easy movie to watch. But, if your braincells don't shut off and you don't expect another Die Hard movie, you will appreciate this masterpiece.",9.0,matej-trkanjec-133-920386,2015/04/03,102,64
1564,Pulp Fiction,Great director. Great story. Great characters. A masterpiece,"Tarantino is without a doubt one of the best directors of all time and maybe the best of the 90's. His first film, Reservoir Dogs was amazing and claustrophobic, his segment in Four Rooms was by far the greatest (even though Rodriguez's was excellent too)and Jackie Brown is a wonderful homage to the Blaxploitation films of the 70's. However, Pulp Fiction remains my favourite. It was nominated for so many Oscars that I still find it hard to believe that it only got one: Best original script. I'm not complaining because Forrest Gump got best picture, since that film was also Oscar-worthy, but come on, movies like Tarantino's or the Shawshank Redemption deserved much more. Anyway, going back to the movie, I particularly liked the first and second chapters, and that's really a contradiction because one of the movie's finest characters, Mr. Wolf, appears on the third. Bruce Willis also does a great job, and as far as I'm concerned he fell in love with the movie right after having read the script. I like the way his character gives a ""tough guy"" image at the beginning and then we discover he's so affectionate and tender to his wife. Travolta is obviously the star of the movie and his second encounter with Bruce Willis in the kitchen along with the scene where he dances with Uma Thurman is when the movie reaches it's highest point. The other star is Samuel L. Jackson, who plays a wise assassin that obviously knows how to handle situations. ""And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger..."" is my favourite quote. Summarizing, Pulp Fiction is a modern classic and a must-see for anyone who is at least aware of what a movie is. I give it a 9 out of 10.",,guybrush105,2000/04/04,570,330
1565,Crash,aesthetically and intellectually offensive,"Contrived, self-conscious, obvious, repetitive, manipulative, heavy-handed, pretentious--apparently these qualities do not count against a film today, at least as far as critics and major awards organizations are concerned. Roger Ebert called ""Crash"" his favorite film of 2005, and the Academy Awards gave the film more recognition than I would have thought possible--even considering the large quotient of lowbrows in Hollywood today. To put it as kindly as possible, ""Crash"" presents us with a shockingly manipulative story and treats delicate social issues with all the subtlety of sledgehammer blows. In essence, it is a bad knock-off of John Sayles, and you would do much better treating yourself to a very fine film like the criminally-neglected ""City of Hope"" (1991) or ""The Sunshine State"" (2002). I should make it clear I wasn't disappointed at all in the performances or the look of the film. No, the trouble is something a bit deeper than that. As far as plot goes, there's this strange obsession in ""Crash"" with making every character experience a major ""reversal."" Good cop becomes bad cop; bad cop becomes good cop; innocent, victimized Middle Easterner becomes a perpetrator of violence--etc. And you can see all of this coming a mile away. Can Hollywood get any more heavy-handed and contrived than this? Well, let's hope not. Additionally, the movie seemed to be telling us that everyone in L.A. is a super-charged racist forever on the edge, ready to blow his or her top at any moment. Messages like this only serve to simplify social issues in a disastrous manner. Essentially, ""Crash"" is classic kitsch: It shows you something for which you, as a product of liberal modernity, have a pre-loaded response. It makes you feel good about not being a racist and about deploring violence. It requires you to do zero intellectual work and then pats you on the back for having the correct ethical orientation toward the subject matter. Personally, I don't think there's ever a good reason for talking down to your audience, and ""Crash"" is full of that. This type of story is every bit as bad as, on the other hand, elitist art that is only trying to communicate with a minute, intellectual clique. The ideal situation, I think, is for artists to treat their audience as thoughtful adults, and for the audience, in turn, to behave like thoughtful adults. Throughout ""Crash,"" I felt Haggis was treating me like, at best, an adolescent who can only be impressed by broad strokes and the most obvious, belabored themes. In his book ""The Art of Fiction,"" John Gardner talks about the bad storyteller being like a playwright who wants to run on stage every few minutes during a performance of his play and point out how every story development and technique is operating--and that is Haggis all over. He constantly shows his ""puppeteer's hand."" Finally, I'm just getting exhausted by seeing people beating that dead horse of racism, over and over and over, in the media... For my money, a movie director is going to have to come up with a deeper, more ingenious approach if he wants me to listen to more of these preaching-to-the-choir sermons. Thankfully, there are directors like John Sayles who still have the talent to pull it off, and with panache.",3.0,awalter1,2006/02/28,104,61
1566,Goodfellas,"I love Scorsese, but hated 'Goodfellas'.","I was first introduced to Scorsese's work with 'Taxi Driver', and was immediately compelled to rush out and rent 'Mean Streets' and then Scorsese's first, 'Who's that Knockin'?' Although these films were both uneven in places, I still saw the same brilliance. So of course I had to rent 'Goodfellas', right? It is in everyone's top 100. And I was monumentally disappointed. There was no struggle with moral issues. These guys were just violent jerks for whom I had no sympathy. I *wanted* them to get caught so someone would get them off of the street (and off of my TV screen). Ray Liotta is such a pretty boy that he could never match DeNiro or Keitel in my book. And the violence in this movie was just sickening and unnecessary. Sorry, folks, disagree with me all you want, but I'm sorry I ever decided to watch 'Goodfellas' and I haven't felt compelled to pick up a Scorsese flick since.",5.0,weensy,2001/11/28,35,15
1567,Taxi Driver,A Dark Journey Through New York,"Martin Scorsese is a director where I'm unsure whether I would love the picture or not as there are some from his work that I didn't enjoy as much as I thought I would. So I came into this thinking maybe it will be decent but nothing more. The film is most definitely excellent and so far my favorite film from him. The plot of Taxi Driver is a man, Travis Bickle, who decides to become a taxi driver and in this profession he sees the filth and waste of the city and this frustrates him deeply. Along the story, he encounters a beauty that stands out from the crowd and a young prostitute he, by chance, sees once in a while and becomes involved with. What held my interest the most is Travis' perspective of the world around him. Schrader has written a fantastic screenplay that keeps itself grounded and personal as we follow this man alone and we only see his understanding of the world, not anybody else's. The story does focus on areas like his romance with Betsy, and his relationship with Iris but it all adds to the point of his frustration. It's plot kept me hook throughout the whole ride and requires a bit of patience as the screenplay is more like the journey of a dark cab ride rather than the destination. This film is herald by many as his greatest film, I can surely say that this film is his best I have seen so far as I have not seen all that he has done. This film felt like a journey of not just Travis but New York as Scorsese wants us to be the passengers of Travis' journey. It clearly shows that Scorsese loves New York and knows how to capture it's beauty and it's filth. The film feels very personal to Scorsese, which is the reason of this film being so grounded as at some level, Travis is Scorsese in a way. There are many people who watch films and feel detached with the protagonist's intentions but I'm the type that follows them and accepts them regardless of their intentions and values. Yes, there are people out there who may watch this film and think Bickle is a little insane but I think he's the only man in the city who has a clear mind. Michael Chapman may be the cinematographer in this film but I felt that the film's image was more tamed by Scorsese rather than Chapman. Scorsese to me, feels like Terrence Malick when it comes to the cinematography as both seem to have a clear idea of what they want and how it should look, which is the reason why their films at times can be a little bit indulgent, not in a bad way. Taxi Driver captures a different side of New York that nobody ever wants to see. Even if the streets are lit by brightly colored neon, the place is still looks like a garbage landfill, and this is because Scorsese knows the area so well that it looks very convincing. I would still give props for Chapman as I think he still had a major contribution in some way. Bernard Herrmann is a legend. The man is responsible for many film scores that have become iconic and adored by many. Taxi Driver's score has this jazzy smooth quality to it that fits very well with the time period and the setting that the film has taken place. The saxophone gives this smooth sound but at the same time feels very sleazy, which fits with Travis' perspective of his surroundings. There are at times where it gets dark and a little crazy, especially when the score is building up and then crashes. Herrmann's work here may not be as iconic as his work on Psycho or Vertigo but great enough that other composers have taken inspiration from him, especially if the film's setting is in New York. The film is driven by DeNiro's performance, which I can definitely consider as one of his best. This is definitely different from his previous work in The Godfather Part II, which is more out there. In Taxi Driver, he plays it simply without any overacting, which is the reason why the whole film feels very smooth. I liked seeing De Niro playing roles like this where he isn't a gangster or a mobster but rather a regular guy. The two women in this film were casted excellently as they were very appropriate for their roles. Cybill Shepherd in this film is beautiful, she is radiant and elegant, and works well with De Niro. I was a little skeptical with Jodie Foster playing as a young prostitute as I have only seen her in strong roles like Silence of the Lambs and Inside Man but she really pulled it off here. Younger actors sometimes tend to overact but Foster kept it easy and light. Harvey Keitel was great but a little bit underused, same goes to Albert Brooks. The acting in this film is spectacular and will definitely be adored by those who like their film with easy-going acting. It contains simple acting gritty photography and excellent direction from Scorsese; making the screenplay come to life. The film overall is fantastic, just seeing New York in this light makes this definitely worth a watch.",10.0,donuthaters12,2013/07/24,13,8
1568,Goodfellas,May I differ?,"Overrated in 1990, *Goodfellas* has grown even more overrated with the passage of 15 years. It's based on the -- I daresay -- untrustworthy recollections of a half-Irish, half-Sicilian mobster-turned-informant who recently, I am reliably informed, appears as an addled, half-witted guest on ""The Howard Stern Show"". The narrative arc, if one can accurately term it that, spans 30 years, roughly from 1950 to 1980. This, of course, gives Martin Scorsese every incentive to soak the background with dozens of pop-culture tunes ranging from Bobby Vinton to Derek and the Dominoes. His use of the last 3 lilting minutes of ""Layla"" as some sort of ironic counterpoint in the extended montage that reveals the corpses of a dozen gruesomely executed mobsters in various places across New York City only underscores his utterly conventional taste in music. One wonders whether Scorsese would've been happier as a Top 40 deejay instead of a filmmaker. His conventionality -- a surprising development, given his success with such Seventies classics as *Mean Streets* and *Taxi Driver*, both infused with his uniquely individual aesthetic -- extends beyond the soundtrack to the actual movie itself. Lovers of this movie will doubtless be distressed to learn that the various stylistic techniques Scorsese uses here -- whip-pans, sudden freezes that supposedly add ironic punctuation to the narrative, even the use of pop music as commentary on a montage -- all derive from French (yes, I said French) auteurs from the New Wave school of the Sixties and Seventies. These same lovers of this movie would probably also consider Orson Welles to be an overrated old fuddy-duddy, but that doesn't stop Scorsese from pointlessly laying on at least two sequences of long tracking-shots through complicated spatial arrangements without cuts, the device Welles perfected if not wholly invented. (An even less impressive feat for Scorsese, who benefits from the technological advance of the Steadicam. Welles did it with old-fashioned cameras on dollies and hydraulic cranes.) I believe that all these borrowings betray Scorsese's fundamental, perhaps unconscious, lack of confidence in the power of his story, here. For the screenplay, let it be said at once, is poorly constructed. The narrative focuses on trivial events, like a gofer getting shot in the foot during a card game or Paul Sorvino slicing garlic to atomic thinness, and then presents the world-famous Lufthansa heist through hearsay. The movie's main character, Ray Liotta as Henry Hill, hears a news report about the heist while in the shower. One may reasonably ask why we're in the shower with Henry when we should be in the getaway car with Robert De Niro's Jimmy Conway and his henchmen. This, of course, leads one to reasonably ask why we're not watching a movie about Jimmy Conway instead of Henry Hill, the latter being, more often than not, on the periphery of the movie's main events. Having Liotta narrate the exciting stuff for us in voice-over is no substitute. Indeed, the movie is cripplingly dependent on voice-over narration, perhaps because Mr. Hill's own story, in and of itself, isn't interesting enough to really warrant a honest-to-goodness movie in the first place. As the movie drones on with Liotta's loquacious narrator ceaselessly filling in the narrative gaps, one suspiciously wonders -- for example -- why Hill and Conway are NOT whacked for bumping off ""made man"" Billy Bats, while Joe Pesci's Tommy DOES get whacked. All three men were involved in the killing, yet only Tommy pays the price. Why? Does Conway's and Hill's Irishness serve as a magical force-field? -- I don't get it. Well, I did say at the beginning of this review that Hill was an untrustworthy storyteller. From the evidence, it appears that Hill was quite conversant with his mob boss's cooking techniques (hence all the time wasted on cooking scenes and shots of gorgeously laid-out family feasts) and far less conversant with the important incidents that are the subject of this film. Note too how inconsistently handled Henry's character is throughout the film: one moment he pistol-whips almost to death a sexual predator who messes with his girlfriend, the next he's aghast when some punk kid gets carelessly killed. Hmm -- smells like self-hagiography to me. After an overly-edited, chaotic, 30-minute final act in which a sweaty-faced, puffy-eyed Liotta drives around the suburbs, peering up through his windshield at police helicopters, dropping off hot guns, going to the grocery store, zipping back home to make meatballs (AGAIN with the cooking!), and so forth, he gets pinched for good. Under the umbrella of the Witness Protection program, he finally rats out his mob bosses . . . and it occurs to us that this should have been the focus of the film all along, i.e., the FBI's successful eroding of the criminal code using Witness Protection. But Scorsese crams it in during the last five minutes of this 3-hour movie. A little less time in the kitchen and in the shower, and a little more time getting down to business, might have made this movie pretty great. As it is, the performers give *Goodfellas* undeniable energy, almost mitigating all its flaws. Fans of good New York actors will forgive this movie everything: Liotta, De Niro, Pesci, Sorvino, and Lorraine Bracco do THEIR job, at least. And perhaps this is why the movie is so well-loved. Colorful characters limned by great performances are entertaining. But, in my judgment, the virtues of verisimilitude can't overcome what amounts to a 3-hour-long non-story. 3 stars out of 10.",3.0,FilmSnobby,2005/11/25,216,90
1569,Hotel Transylvania,"Light joyful fun, Hotel Transylvania is a shockingly good time for all","From the outside, Hotel Transylvania may look like a clichéd and typical aim-at-the-kids-mooch-off-the-adults animated film with pop music, celebrities, cute characters, and plenty of childish humor. It may look like a film that doesn't strive for the heights of Pixar and instead aims for the likes of Dreamworks' lesser efforts. And from a film buff's perspective, it may look like an animated movie with known production hell that was tossed at September to just collect some cash and lessen the losses. But, Hotel Transylvania actually delivers. Surprisingly, and in many departments. It did not just succeed in pleasing the kids, but it actually entertains the adults with quick zany Tex Avery humor with very minimal downtime. Similar to the original Madagascar flick that remains DreamWorks' most consistently entertaining franchise, this movie rapidly fires jokes high, low, and direct to catch the kids, teenagers, and adults off-guard. They took the classic father/growing daughter concept and gave it a clever monster twist that allows for plenty of creativity. And if there is a man that can handle potential creativity, it's the incredibly underrated director Genndy Tartakovsky. Tartakovsky was behind such cartoon gems like Dexter's Laboratory, Powerpuff Girls, the original Clone Wars, and of course, Samurai Jack. He knows how to time jokes, how to time emotion, and knows when his product might be overstaying its welcome. This movie clocks in at a mere 91 minutes, so the movie never feels like its dragging. The script went through so many changes, but they hired the right guy to help mold it into a good backdrop to all the visual humor that dominates the source of all the laughter you'll experience. As previously stated, the overbearing father conflict is supported by an original concept so it never feels like previously charted waters. But let's also hand it to the voice cast for not hamming up the script. Adam Sandler isn't exactly the most prolific actor for doing accents, but with his Sandler touch and knowledge of when to cut back on his material makes for a surprisingly good performance. Partnering up once again is Adam Samberg, and those two work off each other quite well in an Abbot and Costello manner. Rounding out the fun cast is Devid Space, Steve Buscemi, Kevin James, Jon Lovitz, Selena Gomez, and the hilarious Luenell in a limited role. Bottom Line: Hotel Transylvania isn't deep and doesn't carry any cinematic weight, but is indeed a very enjoyable film with plenty of surprises, humor, and even a good bit of heart. It's perfect for kids with the fun cast of characters and silly jokes while it's perfect for adults because it is short, clean-cut, and also has some great adult humor to boot. Tartakovsky took a doomed project and injected plenty of life to it with his brand of humor and his ability to pack plenty of rich content into a limited about of time. Don't let the look or reputation of the studio fool you, this movie packs a light delightful punch.",8.0,diac228,2013/02/07,8,4

It has the usual stale kids' movie humor of recent years, complete with de rigeur auto-tuned musical numbers. For this level of spastic comedy, I was hoping for more laughs, and it's a fairly blah selection of voice talent for the cast. Mostly, it's short on laughs and feels long at just 90 minutes. On the bright side, there's an upward-surge when they finally venture outside the hotel walls (finally giving Buscemi some much-needed spotlight).

The jokes weren't funny, it has the typical Adam Sandler toilet jokes that just make me groan. Jonathon was REALLY annoying. He was this films' Jar Jar.

Adrien Brody projects the right emotions at the right time in the movie. Sadness, happiness, joy and trauma, every feeling has its place in this movie...

1577,Blackfish,"More a polemic than documentary at times, but it is effective as such","I had heard about this film long before I got to seeing it; there are a couple of very liberal media outlets that I use and this film was very much promoted on them – so I had heard good things but was conscious that it was maybe from an easy audience sector. Anyway, I knew enough about it to be pretty sure that we wouldn't be hearing much from Seaworld in the film itself and indeed at the end it is confirmed that they refused to be interviewed for this film. Many have pointed out that this makes the film rather one-sided, but personally I do not think that having an official Seaworld presence in the film would have made much of a difference to that and to be honest it is probably for the best that they didn't get involved. I say this because, although it is not too unfair or aggressive, the film really is a polemic rather a passive documentary; the case is made in a systematic and effective fashion, building the case and it does it in a way that is really hard to not be affected by. The film is at its best when it is as much of a documentary as it can be – so informing the viewer of the nature of orca whales in the wild, their community and their connections, because this then informs us about the actions taken to separate families from one another – and like the massive butch guy who can barely talk about doing it, it is hard not to be really moved by the idea and the reality. Other such contrasts are well done, such as the statements on lifespan etc, however the film doesn't always do it as well. Relating to the older actions (and the illegal ones in particular), the film is a bit unfair to present these next to a silent Seaworld – I know they are not involved but it would have been nice to hear the film confirm if they had ever admitted wrong doing etc. Just mentioning it and moving on makes it look like it was gotten away with, never addressed looking back etc. The interviews with the ex-trainers are all pretty engaging and emotive but there is a lot of personal statement and issues-driven passion in there; this is fine but it means the film has to do a bit to make sure it remains a documentary – I think it could have done more in that regard. These are flaws in the film as a documentary but even with these it is hard to really take the subject and conclusions to issue. It builds its case well, presenting the base of cruelty and the impact to trainers and animals of the Seaworld shows. It does push too far to one side and it doesn't really give you food for thought so much as conclusions, but it is an impacting film and it is hard for me to really take issue with what it is saying even if I had reservations over how it says it.",,bob the moo,2014/06/08,8,7
1578,Spider-Man 2,Superior sequel that lacks vitality,"Before I start, let me say that I thought Spider-Man 2 was superior in every way to Spider-Man 1, but one. Honestly, I don't know what it was about Spider-Man 2 that I found lacking. While it was a better movie with excellent effects, great performances, well-conceived plot elements, and beautiful film shots, it still felt ""flat"" in comparison to Spider-Man 1. Perhaps it was the fact that Peter had to surrender the mask this time. Or maybe it's that he wants to be with MJ so badly, but can't find the intestinal fortitude to be happy AND a super hero. Or it could be that I expected much more with a $61M budget increase. Whatever the dilemma, apparently it was felt by other movie-goers, since the return for that increased budget was down $23M from the first installment. This was like Superman 2 in that our hero chooses to be an earth-bound human to be with the gal he loves, discovers there's a new menace and immediately regrets his decision. Perhaps that was why it felt ""flat."" It's been done. But then again, what hasn't? This was a superior story with superior effects and action sequences that looked realistically played out rather than the CGI mess that was the first installment. Peter coming clean with Aune Mae was a difficult scene to watch. It was a courageous step on the character's part, and Aunt Mae reacted much the way I expected she would which lent a believable tone to the scene. The villain this time around is done extremely well. Gone is the camp of the first installment's treatment of the nemesis, and enters an age of superior CGI. After Spider-Man 1's Green Goblin, I was frankly reluctant in seeing this chapter. I'm glad, now, that I have. Doc Ock is malevolently beautiful in both design and execution. I thoroughly enjoyed his character. While the first Spider-Man rates a 7.4 (at IMDb) and received two Oscar nominations and Spider-Man 2 received none (but strangely, receives a 7.9 rating here at IMDb) the second installment was definitely above the original in every noticeable way. Yet it grossed less with a bigger budget and received no special effects Oscar nominations like the inferior Spider-Man 1 did, which leads me to believe that the lacking element, whatever that may be, affected more than just this movie Fiend. It rates an 8.2/10 from... the Fiend :.",8.0,FiendishDramaturgy,2005/01/17,24,14
1579,Crash,Was I watching a different movie?,"I get the impression that I was watching a different movie to the majority of other people I know who have seen this film. It's not really that I found the film offensive or anything - just that the script was unbelievably amateurish for a film that had obviously had a bit of money thrown at it. I really respected Paul Haggis' work on the Million Dollar Baby script and was bitterly disappointed to see how bad this script was. It was clear to me that it was desperate to be the 'racism' version of Traffic, but I don't think Traffic was really a film worth ripping off in the first place. The worst feature of thisfilm is the way it shamelessly spoon-feeds its audience. Does Haggisreally think we are so dumb as to require a shot of the blanks? Do wereally need to see the phone book sitting on Farhad's dashboard, withthe address circled in black texta? Can we not be left to make someleaps in logic for ourselves? I also had a major problem with the dialogue which was so 'on the nose'. I have heard one critic say that the quality of dialogue is deceptively high, because even though people may not speak this way, they certainly do think this way. That is irrelevant. It is the job of a script like this to utilise dialogue in a way that helps add to the characterisations and believability of the (in this case highly implausible) situations that are set up. These characters all speak using the same voice and all they ever talk about is racism. Surely the purpose of a film like this should be to promote the fact that race should not really be an issue in these situations, but by making it the sole focus of every scene, doesn't it become innately racist itself? Characters walk around spouting their philosophies and conveniently memorised statistics on race relations as though they're regurgitating extracts from the research essay they've just written. It's utterly unconvincing and obvious. A film should reveal its meaning gradually, not slap us in the face with it in the opening scenes and then never let up. I can see that Haggis' intentions with this film were honorable, but dare I suggest that by directing his own script he has not been able to identify and, therefore, overcome its flaws. I really hope that writer/directors will be really careful in future when approaching this 'mosaic' style of narrative. It has been done well a number of times, but getting the balance between the personal and the political right is very difficult. And Robert Altman will not be outdone in that department.",1.0,tclark-5,2005/05/02,959,572
1580,Primal Fear,One of the Top 10 movies of all time in a suspense/drama category!,"Not only is Richard Gere my favorite actor, and the best looking I've seen in a very long time, but he can act too. Also, Edward Norton is fantastic and makes his part seem so real. After seeing this movie, especially the surprise ending, you just knew he was going to be a star---and he's made quite a few movies since then. It's no wonder he won an academy award in his first major role. This movie definitely holds your interest throughout and ranks #1 in my opinion, with ""Fatal Attraction"", ""Reindeer Games, & ""Sleeping With The Enemy"".",10.0,Darbe369,2001/03/17,5,4

I know mentally challenged people that would'nt act this stupid in these situations. Shouting for no reason, talking over each others and doing stupid jokes. (ex: when dale starts screaming Rex's name in the house for no reason). Seriously, this is when I stopped it.

1582,Primal Fear,The Best.. the perfection.,"I always love legal films, courtroom dramas, and use of brain once in a while when watching movies. However, this... is just another level. The story, the perspectives, acting (of course), the message, cinematography.. Everything is just level of perfection. Why I love legal films. Trial movies are not about moral judgement which is very instinctive and quick. They do not define good and evil, right or wrong so fast and clearly. There is a 'grey area' which it can happen so much in real life and a room for my judgement. There are two sides to fight for with the same events and the same character held accountable for wrongdoing. This approach can give deeper investigation of the event and understanding of the character. I love this progress of investigation and understanding because it leads to greater message and discussion. 'Did this happen because of character's personality or surrounding environments?' 'When does this ""surrounding environments"" start to happen? From his or her mother's wombs or from childhood? From when all the events start to happen in the movie?' 'What is good and evil? Is the line clearly distinguished in our daily lives? How do I define my own line?' 'What if good pretending to be good is actually evil?' All the philosophical questions, a core of this 'life', rise, and each trial film answers differently. Why 'Primal Fear' is distinctive. Aaron (Edward Norton's character) shows two opposite extreme of good and evil within one person. ""SPOILER ALERT"" Traditionally, audience would be appalled and uncomfortable if the protagonist (lawyer in legal films) takes evil's side. Therefore, the director or the writer creates situational excuses and inevasible events that lead to defendant's action. However, oh well Hoblit was bold enough to twist all the traditional notions. The director SEEMS to follow common sense that the accused has his own reasons and unavoidable psychological trauma that put him the way he has acted. However, in the end, it was all about him. The protagonist has taken the evil's side all along, but audience cannot be mad at him or criticize the movie's moral because he got you, too. You cannot be horrified at yourself because you can always make excuse for yourself. I loved this movie because this move even fooled me. Acting... was magnificent. Richard Gere was Martin Vail; Edward Norton was Aaron/Roy; Laura Linney was Janet in this movie. I could not see the actors but only the characters for two complete hours, and I cannot give better compliment than this. Their acting lures me into this courtroom and crime scene and makes me feel like I was the part of the team. This movie goes into many layers. First, it was about the crime. What happened in that bishop's room, and who did it? Second, it was about Martin, a lawyer who likes to see the world differently from others and does not have clear line between right and wrong. Third, it was about psychology about human being. Finally, it wraps up so perfectly by Martin standing with a court behind him realizing what he has done and regretting that he does not have a clear line. This movie does not bore you for a bit second. Mise-en-Scene. I loved reading the director's signal for message, especially at the ending. After Martin realizes there was no Aaron, and it was all his act, when he comes out of the courtroom, the camera changes to bird's-eye angle. I interpret as if God, the final judge of good and evil, is looking at him. When he comes out of that courtroom, bird's-eye shot rotate 180 degree vertically, implying everything's upside down. Then, he looks at the crowd gathering outside of the court but finds the back door, feeling Shame, that he never felt before. Gosh, that was genius, summarizing the whole movie in that two minutes. Work of ART! Kudos, Applauds, or whatever it takes to give the credit this movie deserves.",10.0,TaylorYee94,2020/07/27,2,2
1583,The Green Mile,"A wacky, zany film","Rob Schneider Meryl Streep Funnyman Rob Schneider brings his wacky talents to the big screen in The Green Mile, the wacky misadventure of a down-and-out prison worker forced to become a male prostitute in order to pay off a debt. The story begins when Miles Green (Schneider) accidentally kills a prisoner in a wacky mishap. The prison demands that Miles pay $500.00, or face being fired. He is given two weeks to repay the debt. Miles realizes what he must do when he runs into a friend who operates a wacky prostitution ring in the prison. Miles Green renames himself ""Miles O'Smiles"" and begins offering himself as a gigolo. That's when the real wackiness begins, as Miles runs into one customer after another, each with some kind of bizarre, wacky disorder. One girl even has a wacky sleeping disease, where she falls asleep at random times! Hilarious! There's even a scene where they go bowling, and she falls asleep just as she's about to roll the ball, and she goes flying and well, it's just funny as heck. It's truly a wacky, wacky film. There has been lots of talk about The Green Mile sweeping the Oscars, and I agree. I have been a long-time fan of Schneider's, from this days at SNL when he did that character who said everybody's name funny (Tom! Tommy! Tom-arino!) to when he brought the Sly Stallone actioner Judge Dredd to life with his wackiness. But The Green Mile is a new level for him, and I for one and hoping we see a lot more Rob Schneider in the future. This is truly a wacky, wacky, wacky, zany film. I give it one star.",,n_unit,2006/11/26,14,6

I would suggest people get their heads out of their Disneyland asses and start paying attention to what others will do simply to make a buck. I also suggest that we leave nature alone and recognize that just because we are interested in the animals with which we share this Earth, it doesn't give us a right to invade and disrupt their lives.

1585,Taxi Driver,Wow...,"The story follows Travis Bickle, a lonely taxi driver in New York City with some pretty big mental and social issues. He makes a lot of small talk and he struggles connecting with people throughout the film. He plots to murder a presidential candidate known as Palantine and a guy who has a sexual relationship with an underage prostitute. He also grows fond of a woman that works with, but he struggles making a good impression. Taxi Driver is a movie that I have always wanted to watch, but I have been a bit nervous about how I would view the film. However, I really wanted to start watching a couple more really acclaimed films before I go back to school. This seemed like the perfect film to watch on a night like this. Little did I know how much I would fall in love with the film in every scene. I am just going to say it. Taxi Driver is one of the best movies that I have watched since I have been in quarantine and I have seen a bunch of films since my school closed. Seriously, it is in my top 10 at least. I cannot remember the last time I watched a drama where I was so engrossed into the story and world of a film. It is one of the few films that truly sucked me into a new world that made me anxious about what was going to happen next. Every scene in this film is spectacular. I cannot really think of a favorite scene. It is hard to think about where to start with this movie. Taxi Driver is one of those films that has multiple layers to the story. It is about the violence that goes on the street, it is about insanity, it has some themes about how underage prostitution is absolutely immoral and it is ultimately a character study. The film is about Travis Bickle and how he deals with everything surrounding him. It is about his descent to madness that drives his actions and makes him view the world the way he views it. Travis is one of the most unpredictable characters I have ever seen in a film. I never knew what he would do next in any scene that he is in. That is one of the reasons why I found the film to be so tense. He is a pretty morally grey character and one of best ones I have seen. Yes, he does some creepy things, but he also does some good deeds throughout the film. His friendship with Iris is a great example of his good side. He is a great protagonist that I really did not know whether to root for or root against. His motivations are terrific as well. Robert De Niro's performance as Travis Bickle is nothing short of phenomenal. Every single line of dialogue and every expression he gives lands flawlessly. It is one of the best performances I have ever seen. A standout scene is one where Bickle is in the cab with another man who is just threatening to murder his own wife. I could feel De Niro's expression of fear and discomfort during that scene. He is playing as a character who has gone pretty crazy, but here, it looks like he is going have a heart attack hearing the way this guy is talking. It is one of the best acted scenes I have ever seen. De Niro's performance is absolutely spectacular. As for the rest of the cast, Jodie Foster plays as Iris and she is terrific in the role. She is a standout with her performance and the breakfast scene is a perfect example of it. She was just so natural in the entire scene. Nothing from her performance felt melodramatic or forced. It is even more impressive considering how young Foster was during the making of this film. Harvey Keitel plays as Sport, the antagonist I think? He was fantastic in the film and he was probably one of the most despicable villains I have ever seen in a film. It is a bit hard to notice at first, but it truly shows the more you think about his grotesque actions. Keitel played this character perfectly. Cybil Shepherd plays as Betsy and she only had a couple of scenes, but they did not waste a single moment with her. Shepherd delivers a great performance and Betsy was surprisingly good character. She plays a pretty significant role on showing what Travis' character and personality is like. The rest of the supporting cast is amazing too. All of the supporting characters are significant to the plot because they all have an affect on Travis in some way. The tone and pacing are both perfect. This film is really dark and there is pretty much no humor to speak of. It works with the story because there is really nothing that could be funny in here. Some stories in film work even better without any humor. Not many, but there are a couple of them out there. Taxi Driver is one of those films. The film is about awkwardness and tension and the tone delivers on that. The movie is perfectly paced. It is neither too fast nor too slow. It allows the story and characters to develop accordingly and it builds on the tension of the climax with each scene at such a smooth rate. This movie has some of the most flawless pacing I have ever scene. It is a good reason why the film is so engaging. The cinematography is stunning and it holds up beautifully. There are so many impressive shots in this film including an impossible shot that took me by complete surprise. More than anything though, the cinematography is great because it captures that mysterious, scary tone of the city at night. Every scene that takes place in the cab at night is haunting to look at. The dull colors make the lights stand out even more. Speaking of lighting, the lighting is very creative as well. It is easy to see all of the conversation scenes that take place at night as well as any action that takes place. The lighting in the cab scenes are particularly superb and unique. The cinematography is amazing and just about every shot is interesting to look at. The climax is one of the most intense and insane that I have ever scene. It is brutal to watch as it is nail-biting. It is also very well-shot and edited. It was never confusing. It was just full of tension and blood. I legitimately did not know how this film would end and the climax surprised me as well. The soundtrack is terrific. Every musical piece fits the song perfectly. There is some catchy jazz music throughout, but the best piece of music is the moment after the climax where you hear this eerie piece of music. It is one of the most haunting bits of music I have ever heard. It made me feel like I was walking in the aftermath of the bloodbath that took place in the climax. Again, it is weird, but music can make a movie feel more like an experience sometimes and the soundtrack of this film did just that. The credits song was great too. In a nutshell, I liked Taxi Driver. In fact, I liked it more than I ever thought I would. It is so different from anything that I have ever seen. Not only those it bring some thought-provoking ideas to the table, but it also has one of the best and most interesting stories in a film. This is the first Martin Scorsese film that I watched and I did not know if I would like his films or not. Now, I want to watch all of his films after this. Taxi Driver is one of the best movies I have ever seen and it might be a new favorite for me.",10.0,jaredkjacoby,2020/07/17,13,13

Detective Jerry Lynch made the film what it was. His character is hilarious. The acting was very good, they did a great job. It was a nice way to spend an hour or so, and I recommend it.

1587,Goodfellas,"Can A Sick Film Be A Good One, too? I Guess So.","Sad to say, almost everyone I know - at least, the males - who has seen this movie likes it very much. I enjoy it, too. I say ""sad"" because it's a sick film in many ways. Also, when you have 240-plus f-words in a movie, I mean, come on! In that respect alone, I'm embarrassed to say this movie is part of my collection. That's simply because it's a fascinating story, for the full 145 minutes. This is a rough film, to say the least. It's not just the language; there are some brutally- violent parts. Joe Pesci's ""Tommy DeVito"" seems to be involved with some of the worst of that violence Supposedly, the movie is a based on a true story but how much of this is true, who knows? It certainly provides a vivid portrait of Mafia life in New York City. I really loved the narration by Ray Liotta - who doesn't? - and enjoyed the music in here. Most people comment about the music; it's a good soundtrack. Pesci, Liotta, Robert De Niro and Paul Sorvino all make for extremely interesting gangster characters. With all the language, which includes at least 15 usages of the Lord's name in vain and some subtle religious cheap shots (not surprising considering who directed the film), the gory spots this film gets a little too rough-edged at times. I've watched thousands of crime movies, and this gets to be a little much here and there but if none of the above offends you, you're in for a treat with an intense crime story that is very watchable.",9.0,ccthemovieman-1,2007/01/12,33,17

The humor is a bit hit or miss, mostly kid-oriented but there were some creative jokes and I laughed out loud a couple times.

1589,Spider-Man 2,Better than the first!,"I for one was not totally blown away by the first Spider-Man film. Yes, it is a good comic to film, but somehow I just didn't get caught up in all the hoopla. That was changed with Spider-Man 2. This film took the successful elements from the first (character and acting) and pushed it up another notch. We were given again only 1 new villain, this saved much needed time to flesh out Peter Parker/Spider-Man as well as further the other story lines going on with those surrounding Peter. The struggle that Peter goes through; should he or shouldn't he sacrifice his life for others, is handled beautifully here. You feel that struggle. He may be a ""superhero"", but he is still just a kid trying to sort out his life. A life that seems to sucker punch him every single day. I thought this was the most logical step to take the franchise after the introduction in the first. The special effects this time were much improved over the first. Many times I was taken out of the moment in the first film because the effects looked to much like effects and were not natural. That is still a problem from time to time here again, but by in large a much better outing. Story, performances, effects, all were improved in the 2nd installment, something we just don't see happen a lot. One of the best comic to film productions ever in my opinion.",9.0,RCWjr,2007/07/16,10,7

1592,Interstellar,Interstellar: How Film Can Make you Feel Adventure Again,"Every generation of movie goers sees one film, maybe two, that changes the game for them. It becomes a signature moment that they remember years to come. They remember where they saw it, who they saw it with, even where they were sitting. Christopher Nolan has proved to be a film maker who works best with a big canvas, and he has never been given a canvas bigger than the one he used for his latest film, ""Interstellar"". I feel I can't even call going to see a Nolan piece a movie but more like an ""event"". For the average movie goer, they most likely aren't familiar with the directors of the films they're seeing but most know Nolan. Most know of Nolan because he has made some of the biggest, thrilling, and thought provoking films of the past decade from the Dark Knight trilogy to Inception. It's almost not worth trying to do a plot synopsis of ""Interstellar"" because it is difficult to try to condense the happenings in a film this huge because I know that I will leave out something big. Anyway, the film takes place in a potentially not-too-distant future where the earth has become unable to produce all but a few crops and it will get to a point where none will be able to grow and man will die out. In comes an engineer/pilot/father Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) who is entrusted to be part of a space expedition to venture beyond a newly discovered wormhole to try and find a new planet capable of inhabiting the human race. Astronauts from previous missions have supposedly landed and have been sending signals for them to come. McConaughey has always had that ""movie star"" potential and I think this is the film that puts him in that title. This was a truly star making role due to the size of the film and I honestly believe he is the only man who could have done it. ""Interstellar"" was originally supposed to be done by Steven Spielberg before he dropped out and Nolan stepped in. Nolan, clearly influenced by past Spielberg films like ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" and ""Jaws"", puts McConaughey in a role in the same vein as Richard Dreyfuss in ""Close Encounters"" or Roy Schneider in ""Jaws"". They needed an actor who could be looked at as an everyday guy who is experiencing incredible circumstances and McConaughey is able to display the emotion required for a man who has to drop everything, including his family whom he knows he may not see again, and try to save the human race. You can see it in his eyes and hear it in his voice and your heart breaks and lifts with his simultaneously. This isn't necessarily a role that wins Oscars but it should be. The effects are obviously amazing. This, much like ""Gravity"" last year, is a film that needs to be seen on the big screen, especially in IMAX. This, along with the haunting score of frequent Nolan collaborator Hans Zimmer, almost transports you to that necessary place that makes the events happening on screen seem possible. Kind of piggy backing off of that point, there will be those who will trash the film for ""the science isn't accurate"". Those comments are nonsense because no matter what ""science"" tells us, there is just no way for us to actually comprehend what is beyond a wormhole or what would happen if we attempted to go through one. Could we really transcend time and space? Would we discover new worlds and new civilizations? Impossible for us to say at this point, but what makes this film so great is that we are able to see the ideas of ""what can be"". It's the mystery of the unknown that both frightens and enthralls man and few films have been able to capture those feelings like ""Interstellar"" In a time where there are no more explorers, we're fortunate to be put in a position where we can feel what is like to discover and explore new worlds. People will remember ""Interstellar"" for either being a truly great film experience or ""not as good as 2001: A Space Odyssey"". This is one of most popular slights against the film so far as it is the closest thing to ""2001"" and defenders of the Kubrick classic will argue to the death that it doesn't live up to it. This is an argument that no one will win because it is a generational issue. People see these landmark films during their youth and they leave such an impression on them, that it almost becomes blasphemy to hear of another film made years later, rivaling the one they saw. People want to believe that the film from their time was the best and that no film will be able to capture those emotions they first felt and the memories that it created for them. I respect and detest this because I will most likely feel the same way when future space adventures in the same vein as ""Interstellar"" come out and I fear it is something that is out of my control. Much of the film circles around the idea that love is the one true thing that travels purely through time and space because it is that connection we feel with one another that makes us human and that can be applied with our love for certain films. The connection we feel with our favorite films is almost unshakable and those who think they can make us waver from those feelings are exercising in futility. In the end, ""Interstellar"" is one of those landmark films. It's a chance for us to escape reality and feel sense of adventure, hope, and amazement that rarely comes around. Don't miss it.",10.0,PostingandToasting,2014/11/08,79,45
1593,Detachment,Excellent,"To begin this review, I would just like to thank Mr. Brody for being absolutely amazing in this film. He has always been a favorite of mine, and his role in Detachment only solidifies my belief that he is one of the elite actors of our time. I've seen several of Adrien Brody's movies in the past - my favorite being The Experiment - up until I saw this film. I have many friends that are teachers, and it's almost sad to consider the fact that they may feel just as ""detached"" as Mr. Brody's character. The film is an eye-opener to anyone who has ever neglected the hard truths that plague our society. The day will come when all of us have to ask ourselves what we've accomplished in our lives, however large or small. Great film, and one of the best I've seen in a long time.",10.0,jrkordan084,2012/10/07,6,4
1594,Goodfellas,"Overrated, glamorises violence and crime","This is actually quite a nasty film, with no likable characters at all - it's made from Henry Hill's perspective (played by Ray Liotta) but I didn't like him; I'm not sure whether he was supposed to come across sympathetically but he didn't to me. The film has some scenes of extreme violence, which I found pretty distasteful - watching someone get repeatedly graphically stabbed, having their head bashed in with a pistol butt, or having their head kicked in, isn't an enjoyable experience for me, call me weird. There is little plot to the film, and what there is is slow and drawn out. You don't really care what happens to any of the characters, in fact I wanted them all to be put behind bars personally! This film sends out entirely the wrong message: being in the mafia is cool, violence is cool, being a criminal is cool. The 'Tommy' character is especially nasty and violent, and some of his scenes provide for uncomfortable viewing. At the end of the film, Henry Hill avoids prison by ratting on his friends, not because of any high principles or because he's seen the light, but just to stay out of prison. I know it's probably news to some of the people who have given this film high ratings but violence and crime are not glamorous and not something to be celebrated. 4/10 overall",1.0,dvg757,2003/12/05,254,100
1595,Primal Fear,Ed's movie,"This is a coming out party for Edward Norton, no doubt about it. He carries it and was far more deserving of the Academy Award that year than Cuba Gooding, Jr. (the only thing I can say about Jerry Maguire, typical TC fare, was that it didn't totally suck but that's another review). Good story with interesting plot twists and for once, Richard Gere did a passable job acting, but after hundreds of movie roles he will never be what Edward Norton already was by his first.",,hillary1,2003/08/25,2,2
1596,Detachment,"Truly An Excellent Film, A MUST Watch","It's directed by Tony Kaye who has done one of my favorites, American History X. Let me just be clear right now, I f@cking loved this film, it had been a while that I watched a legit film like this; films like these are relief and remedy to my soul. Talking about the story, my god, it's a pure emotional, tragic, and essential story, you get bonded with the main character so well, all his struggles and pain, his feelings and sadness, his responsibility towards these young careless students. It's a simple story, a sub teacher who feels responsible about his student and their future but at the same time dealing with his own difficulties. So indeed it's a sad drama story, but it delivers a heavy message with a lot of emotion to it, and that's I love it Performances are very fine; Adrien Brody delivers and doesn't disappoint in any scenes. Supporting roles are cast well, especially Sami Gayle, I hope she gets more recognized, she's definitely talented and has a long road ahead of her, which can be bright and successful. Even though, I get a feeling some might say her character was useless, I would totally disagree, because it shows Adrien Brody's character cares about teenagers, not just as his profession. One element that levels up the emotion in the film is the soundtrack. My god, The Newton Brothers doesn't disappoint for a second; their work seriously needs to get more recognized here. If a day comes with me becoming a filmmaker, I'd love to work with them for a project. The cinematography and editing are fine, for some the cinematography might get annoying due to some cam shakes, but honestly you can let it go and not be serious with, it made the tone more authentic in my opinion. Finally, I highly recommend this film to everyone. Even if you don't like drama movies please, still own it and show it to your kids or grandchildren at some point, this is a must see for any students, or even parents - I'm sure you won't be losing your eyes by watching a legit drama movie that has a proper message and lesson. My rating is 9/10.",9.0,sahamh,2013/07/10,6,4
1597,Crash,...And Burn,"I wrote this as a two part review. Part two has spoilers. Part 1: No, this isn't that one about the sex with car accidents. This is the one about racism in L.A. You know, the one where everybody is a racist, and race is the topic on everybody's mind at all times. Race. Its like the movie has a form of turrets syndrome where race is the constant theme. Race. Racist. Racism. Race Relations. Relay race. Paul Haggis made a movie which took the structure of Magnolia, which was used to show the disconnect of people who are tangentially connected, and then screwed it into a 1'53"" mental vomit about racism in America. RACE. In the 24 hour period we have 7 stories running parallel all connected and about race. The first hour, people say ridiculous stuff and do absurd things in an effort to be real about racism in America. For example, the story with Ludicrous and Larenz Tate provides the comic relief. Too bad, the first half of their story is lifted straight from The Bonnie Situation in Pulp Fiction. RACISM. Their section is the Quentin Tarantino section where, instead of being cool and talking about foot massages and religion, the characters talk about race and racism. CONSTANTLY. The other good thing about it is the Mexican story when the Mexican guy is talking to his daughter. He gives her his invisible impenetrable cloak to protect her from bullets. Decent writing, but that's only because the writers have had daughters and know what they would say in his place. The rest of the stories are extremely ludicrous. The Hindi does not act in any semblance of realism. The scene where he's trying to get the lock fixed and the Mexican tells him he needs a new door is abbreviated and stupid. Why would anybody act like that? Is it realistic? NOOO. It reminds me more of the convenience store clerk from The Doom Generation. ""Six Dollar Sixty Six Cents girly."" If i ever watch the second half of the movie, I hope his head is shot off and his bodiless head starts coughing up relish. I haven't mentioned race in over a paragraph. RACE. RACISM. RACE FOR THE SUN. Better. Then, there is the black guy who wants to be white, Matt Dillon who has a chip on his shoulder against blacks, Ryan Phillippe who looks beautiful and does nothing, and various other bad actors acting badly with bad dialog. When Matt Dillon molests the black producers wife, could I help it if I was cracking up? When Philippe is second guessing his writing up of his partner for racism, can I help but crack up? The movie is so funny when it is being racist. Racist. RACIST I tell you. Now, mind you, this movie was nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay, and Best Editing, besides a nod to Matt Dillon who actually did attempt to do a decent job. Who was paid off for that one, I have no clue. Don't see it unless you feel like being preached at about the racism in society through a bad and unrealistic script from 2 white men over fifty who have no semblance of reality or interaction with real society in any way shape or form. D- Part 2: The second half of Crash takes any and all story lines in the first half...and spews them back out in a sort of redemptive, conclusionary, the world is a big coincidence kind of way. And it is in fact one of the worst ways to do it. Take 1999's Magnolia. People weren't conveniently tied together over and over again. They were just connected in a strange way that happens more often than you think. You know somebody who knows somebody who did something that you knew somebody else was also involved in. Crash takes this wrapping into a serious extreme. The stories are lined up so everybody meets again. Are there only 5 on the LAPD force? Aren't these people working weird shifts? Dillon and Philippe were a late shift then an early one the next day? And, why did Tate have to be the murdered hitchhiker? Wouldn't it have had more emotional tension, as well as realism, if it had been somebody we had not been following all day long? Like Phillippe just picks up a random hitchhiker and then freaks out. Everybody'd be freaking out. Eventually, in the second half, the touching invisible cloak scene is used to get the Hindi to shoot the daughter. It ticked me off and made me feel dirty. Not that the Hindi shot the daughter, but that they created a beautiful touching scene and then had it be the direct cause of people tearing up. It really ticked me off. At the writers, not the scene. The whole movie is fake and totally uncalled for. The coincidences are far too many and they require an extreme suspension of disbelief. Unlike Magnolia which was connected mildly, this had connections upon connections upon connections which were just so over-the-top. The only good part in the second half was when Sandra Bullock falls down the stairs. She doesn't die though. She should have. I cheered when she fell. The worst part about the movie is it pulls a Magnolia. Not just in structure, but it has a montage over the song In the Deep where you see everybody being depressed. Magnolia took this and had post-modern commentary on it by having all of the characters singing along to Aimee Mann's Wise Up. Unfortunately, Magnolia came out in 1999, while Crash came out in 2005. Its hard to make commentary on a movie which won't be made for another 6 years, but it happened. Somehow. Utter waste of my time. First half: D-; Second half: lowest grade ever; Overall: F---",1.0,cofemug,2006/02/27,289,171
1598,Blackfish,A documentary of cruelty only humans are capable of,"This documentary is nothing more but a proof of how GREEDY, cruel, heartless, brutal and inhumane we, humans, are. We care so much about our own welfare and our money, that we are perfectly willing to trade absolutely anything for it. Watching this poor creature in documentary, literally broke my heart. What beasts we are. Tolerating such torture. Even supporting this by visiting such shows. Teaching our children that not only there is nothing wrong if we treat animals like that, but this is also our entertainment and we should enjoy in this torture of innocent animals. This documentary deserves the best publicity, so it would reach as many people as possible.

Most disturbing scene- trainers engaged in the collection of seed from Tilikim to impregnate other whales in captivity. No, seriously, once you've seen it, you can't unsee it.

1600,Taxi Driver,Notes from Above Ground.,"Somewhere in the shadows of the night, hidden within the restraints of his taxicab, a lonely man watches with disgust. His eyes survey the streets with all the malice and passion of a burning fire, his large pupils an open doorway leading into his soul. The demons haunt him; voices in his head convince him that the world is closing in and the only way out is through some form of moral redemption; a physical and emotional catharsis. The stranger's name is Travis Bickle and he is God's Lonely Man: a discharged Vietnam veteran who wanders the streets at night in a permanent state of confusion and self-loathing. Travis takes a job as a cab driver to keep out of the porn theaters that have been occupying his time Â– deciding he might as well get paid for roaming since he does it anyway. But Travis' filtered input and odd output seems to suggest something is dreadfully wrong. The mild insanity of our protagonist begins to escalate. He approaches an attractive political campaign adviser, Betsy (Cybill Shepherd), and asks her out to dinner. She agrees, but the date is cut short when Travis takes her to an X-rated film. Travis soon meets a young underage prostitute named Iris (a fourteen-year-old Jodie Foster), whom he feels a desire Â– nay, a need -- to rescue from slavery. Iris' pimp, Sport (Harvey Keitel), becomes another of Travis' demons. Taxi Driver was released in 1976 to split praise. Some critics hailed it as a masterpiece, whilst others were a great deal more reserved in their accolade. In Newsweek, Jack Kroll wrote ""(Â…) in their eagerness to establish rich and moral ambiguities, the Catholic Scorsese and the Calvinist Schrader have flubbed their ending. It's meant to slay you with irony, but it's simply incredible."" Some critics just hated the film in general and felt the entire runtime was a mess of pretentious storytelling and depressing, gritty themes. Depressing? Yes. Gritty? Yes. Brilliant? Most definitely. Scorsese does not merely address Travis as a character; he puts us inside his head. And even so, there are instances of abnormality in Scorsese's camera work that suggest paranoia and schizophrenia; moments of displaced subjectivity in which we are neither looking quite through the eyes of Travis nor through those around him, but more at length to his sideÂ…yet it seems that his body (primarily his hands) are below us, at the side of the frame, indicating an altered version of the traditional P.O.V. Scorsese's movie is structured using diverse narrative elements Â– one of the most prominent being dramatic irony rooted in Greek tragedy (in this case, many set-up and pay-off moments). When Travis exits the brothel for the first time, a Mafioso figure says, ""Come back any time."" Travis responds, ""I will."" We know he will, too, and when he does, that's the pay-off. Above all else the film is rooted in the basic existentialism philosophies of Berdyaev, Heidegger and Nietzsche. Scorsese later admitted this his toying of genres and philosophy was entirely incidental (""It just felt rightÂ…"") but one can't help but imagine Schrader may have been influenced by Fyodor Dostoevsky's Notes from the Underground, in which our narrator begins, ""I am a sick manÂ…I am a spiteful man."" This brings to mind the scene in which Bickle dictates his journal entries to us and delivers an ultimatum to the ""filth"" on the streets, preceded by senseless introspective rambling. Moving on, the ultimate puzzle of the film: Does our hero live or die? After Travis is shot in the climactic battle, he lies on a sofa, presumably dying, and makes a gesture with his fingers, pretending to shoot himself in the head. The camera pulls up, overhead, and exits the brothel. It then pulls back across the street and up into the heavens, surveying the crowd below. In the next scene, Travis is alive and well, presented to the world as a hero through the media. Yet as Travis pulls away from the curb at the end of the film, Herrman's familiar four notes (the same ones as used for the final shot of Psycho, implemented when Norman Bates' lack of absolute sanity is finally revealed) come into play. A bell rings. Travis looks in his rearview mirror, as if maybe something caught his eyeÂ… And then, suddenly, the movie ends. Taxi Driver's ending cannot be resolved further more than conjecture and opinion. Scorsese himself says on the DVD making-of documentary that he believes the ending is open for analysis. Did Travis live? Did he die? Are the demons on the street still haunting him? Are we meant to sympathize with him and believe he is a hero, or are we meant to refuse him as one? (Or is this our natural reaction against Scorsese's own wishes -- which would explain the negative reviews in '76?) But it is ultimately the haunting image of Bickle drifting through the endless hordes of nameless people on the streets of Manhattan that lingers with us after the film has ended, and remains the most prescient today. How effortlessly this man can disappear into the multitudes Â– God's Lonely Man once again alone, alienated and betrayed by the world he has come to loathe. That, above all else, is the most poignant aspect of Taxi Driver.",10.0,MovieAddict2016,2005/10/01,46,31

How could they drag the movie out that long for such a stock plot and predictable ending? And the execution scenes seemed to be there for shock value only, and were quite gruesome and gratuitous. I like Tom Hanks, but I refuse to like a movie he stars in simply for reason that he is in it. There has to be a plot, and The Green Mile came up short.

1603,Moon,Shot for the Moon. Missed.,"The movie Independence Day was released on the 4th of July (1996). Tim Burton's upcoming post-apocalyptic animation feature 9 will open on 9–9–09. So you'd think, wouldn't you, that a movie called Moon would have come out on July 20? But no, evidently Sony Pictures Classics figured that, after 40 years, missing by only 3 days wouldn't be that big a deal. Of course, as we know from actual flights to the Moon, the 1st 400,000 km is the longest part, but not the hardest; if you're off by a tiny fraction of a percent on arrival, you crash. And that attitude, regrettably, also shows up in the movie itself. They start with an absolutely dynamite idea — the sort of SF story that I always beg and plead to have made into a movie — and fritter away all that potential with gaping logic holes during the execution. Sam Rockwell stars as Sam Bell, who is (we think) the only live person represented on screen, since he's the lone (and lonely) tech on site at a mining operation on the far side of the Moon. It's vital that he be there, since Earth has nearly exhausted its supply of fossil fuels but continues to maintain its materialistic lifestyle thru profligate use of fusion power — fueled by the Helium-3 found in usable quantities only on the Moon (as we learn from the film's opening sequence, a ""commercial"" touting Lunar Industries Ltd., the megacorp that runs the helium mine). Recent coverage of the Apollo 11 mission reminds us that the video camera that captured the stunning live pictures of Neil Armstrong's historic ""1 small step"" was itself left behind, as was all the other stuff the mission designers could reasonably unload. That's because basic physics and economics dictate that it's horrendously expensive to boost mass up out of Earth's gravity well, so you do it as seldom as possible, and pack as lightly as you can. This is exactly the thinking of Lunar Industries, which has signed Sam to a 3-year contract. As the movie opens, he's looking forward to going home to his beautiful, loving wife and adorable baby dotter in only 2 weeks, when he reaches his ""sell by"" date. However, as it turns out, that's not just an awkward play on words, since Lunar had something else in mind. It costs money to ship mass back to Earth, too, y'know. Sam starts seeing other people, people who can't possibly be there. Normally a rock-steady performer (psychologically screened for the job, we readily assume), he's increasingly distractable. His health starts deteriorating, similar to the way the equipment is starting to wear out (most distressingly, the lost communication signal from Earth). He worries that he's losing it. And here ends the plot description, because there are several plot twists (not just one) the rest of the way, and I don't want to spoil them. They are the elements that, as I said above, made for a dynamite story idea. Normally I'm thrilled when movie-makers give the audience credit for some intelligence and imagination, and that's the case here. The automated helium harvesters that Sam superintends are known prosaically as 1–4, and we're left to infer from casual conversation that Sam calls them Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. The fonts and abbreviations used in the command center are identical to what Stanley Kubrick used on Discovery in 2001, and director Duncan Jones just puts them out there as Easter eggs for the cognoscenti. There's even some sly meta-humor in naming the movie's production company Lunar Industries! But here's the thing. If you expect the audience to be sophisticated enuf to pick up on those subtleties, how will they not notice such glaring incongruities as equipping Sam with a large supply of whittlin' wood (way heavier than MP3s)? Or a ping-pong table (for a 1-person camp!)? Or the idiot use of multiple large antennas, evidently for the sole purpose of jamming communications — something that the base's robot intelligence GERTY (voiced by Kevin Spacey) could easily have accomplished for a tiny fraction of the effort? And it's not giving away too much to say that, if you see the film, you too will wonder ""Why so many of them?"". It's one thing to find yourself thinking, an hour after having left the theater, ""That didn't make any sense."", ""No, they wouldn't have done it like that."", or ""Man, no way all that stuff could have happened in that short a time."". It's quite a different thing when those thots keep running thru your head when you're actually trying to watch the movie. Too bad. Coulda been great. Shot for the Moon.

The emotional layer is as great as it gets. You may very well find yourself crying possibly more than once.

1605,The Wailing,A movie about a buffoon and...,"*SPOILER ALERT FOR MORONS* I can't rate this high because the movie is overlong for such a simple story, the special effects fall short, and the main character is so irritating. There is a lotof WAILING in the movie for sure, but instead of it being satisfying,you're left with a keen sense of annoyance. I guess the lead should be praised for portraying such an oafish buffoon, but in light of the story (zombies and demonic possession), it tends to grate to the point of masochism. The movie takes itself very seriously, which may cause one to exalt it as something higher than what it is. Ultimately it's a fairly simple demonic possession and zombie movie. There's a subtext that hints to a poor relationship between paganism and monotheism, but it's not explored to any satisfaction.

His character does some of the funniest things in the movie (both verbally and physically). Chris Pine did a good job in his role also. Christoph seemed very similar to other roles that he's done in previous movies, but he played a good character in this one.

This sequel, however, is one of the funniest films I have ever seen and certainly to my mind the most outstanding example of a sequel improving on its predecessor. The film is cleverly plotted with refreshing comedic ideas. It also references the first film in welcomed ways. This time around the trio can just go for it with a great script and the experience of the 2011 film. I found Charlie Day's Dale Arbus annoyingly over the top at times in the original, but in this sequel everyone is on point with real comedic chemistry. Christoph Waltz continues to flourish with his supporting role. Chris Pine is great in his role. Jamie Foxx and Kevin Spacey successfully reprise their roles as expected. I do not normally think of myself as a Jennifer Aniston fan, but she is indispensably good in both films.

1610,Ferris Bueller's Day Off,Not the most enjoyable day,"Ferris Bueller's Day Off is among the most acclaimed and beloved comedy films of its generation. Which is quite startling as this is a very ordinary, frankly disappointing, film. There's not enough fun, not enough laughs. The movie never truly sparks to life. Ferris Bueller had a pretty eventful day. But it doesn't translate. Ferris, the character, probably found his day off to be wildly exciting. Living it is one thing. Watching it is another. For those of us who can only watch it is not particularly exciting at all. It's an absurdly simple story. High school senior Ferris Bueller skips school and, girlfriend and best friend in tow, goes to Chicago and does some stuff. There's a subplot about the school principal who is obsessed with catching Ferris. This subplot falls completely, and rather annoyingly, flat. The principal is an unfunny irritant. Time spent with him is time wasted. We'd rather spend more time with Ferris and his friends. But honestly the time we do spend with them is disappointing as well. Matthew Broderick gives a game performance, infusing Ferris with some personality. But the girlfriend, played by Mia Sara is a dud. A stunningly beautiful dud but a dud nonetheless. And Cameron, the mopey best friend played by Alan Ruck, is a total drag. Ferris tries to get Cameron to loosen up and have a good time. Not happening. And then, in a film which is meant to be escapist fun, things get all too serious as Cameron has to deal with his unseen, overbearing father. The tone here is all wrong. It puts a damper on a film which wasn't even as fun as it is cracked up to be in the first place. The great adventure Ferris went on wasn't so great. It was quite frankly mundane. Laughs are in desperately short supply. The principal is notably annoying and the other supporting characters, including Ferris's sister, add nothing to the proceedings. The device of Ferris breaking the fourth wall and speaking to the camera is overused and wears thin very quickly. All in all this is a very disappointing movie, one which falls far short of the expectations you would have of it given its stellar reputation.",5.0,hall895,2015/07/12,7,4

1612,The Green Mile,A rare gem of casting and direction.,"Frank Darabont returns to the directors chair with another adaptation of Stephen Kings novel. The events take place at a death row, the guards call the green mile. The story is a layered, rather character-driven fantasy tale of the events that transpire at ""the mile"" after the arrival of a giant man, John Coffey (Michael Duncan), convicted of the murder of two small girls. Actually this is not one single story, but several tied together seamlessly. A character-driven movie requires a lot from the cast, and fortunately when it comes to cast, The Green Mile delivers. As the poster of the movie tells, this movie stars Tom Hanks as Paul Edgecomb, senior prison guard of the mile, and as always he performs very well indeed. Yet the cast around him is even more spectacular, perhaps partially due to them being relatively unknown. With a face you know, one inevitably remembers previous performances, and the new role is coloured by this. Doug Hutchison as Percy Wetmore, a mean spirited prison guard was particularly impressive, yet his character could have been given more depth. The most captivating was the performance of Michael Duncan. It is hard to find a flaw in this movie. The camerawork is superb, cast wonderful and direction flawless. The movie's considerable length, a bit over three hours, is something that had me worried. Yet the marvellous cast and the peaceful yet firm pace of the movie held my attention progressively through the three hours right to the touching culmination. Many will find this movie to be too long, but I for one was delighted of the style, combination of simplicity of events and depth of characters and conversation. All in all the The Green Mile is a very touching drama, with the joys and sorrows of the life pictured with great skill, if not the best movie of the year. Five out of five.",10.0,uniikki,2000/02/10,454,404
1613,The Fault in Our Stars,the fault in the adaptation,"One of the best things about TFIOS was the voice of Hazel. It put a great, creative spin on an otherwise common disease story. We don't entirely lose it here. It's in the narration, and in her speech. Some of the book's whimsy comes out with cute choices like placing text messages into speech bubbles above the characters' heads in the book's font. But...from the beginning, we lose the Hazel's wry commentary, and the movie treats the kids' diseases as the most pressing issues, rather than their mental grappling with them. When Augustus is introduced, he is practically stalkerish in his attention toward Hazel, which is forgivable only because of his cuteness. From here on in, it's all twee cuteness. Augustus is a wonderful, but impossibly movie-like boyfriend who would probably get on your nerves in real life, and would also probably be hiding a terrible secret. The movie is not as pressing as the book when we go to Amsterdam to meet the author that inspires her. There's very little urgency or conflict. The movie delivers sweetness and young love, and it truly is sweet, but at times it loses the flavor of the book. I will also say the wardrobe and art direction are terrible, and that I'm not sold on Shailene Woodley's star quality. Even though her man has one leg, it still seems he could do better. I'm knocking this movie a lot, but I will recommend. The preview audience seemed to laugh and cry in all the right places.",6.0,cornflakeboy20,2014/05/29,33,13
1614,October Sky,"Got the movie yesterday, not impressed, now must see it again","I actually rented the movie to see Laura Dern. Was not too impressed at first until I learned it was a real life story of a man named Homer Hickam from the coal mining area of West Virginia who was more interested in rockets after he saw Sputnik. At that period of time I had just gotten married, stationed in the D. C. area and was watching the sky like everybody else, but saw nothing. Here's the chill part!! I never heard of Homer Hickam until 24 hours ago. On the news tonight, 1/15/06, there was a memorial service for those miners who died in the mines early this week. A man was speaking to the crowd..a name came on the screen, Homer Hickam! 1/16/06. After seeing the movie again, I was moved by the story and really enjoyed it and it brought back memories of that period. Had to change to a 10. I must say, a very wonderful movie, hated to take it back. All were new actors to me except Homer Sr, and Laura Dern. They were all just great and I'm usually critical of new faces.",10.0,milwhitt70,2006/01/15,1,1

1616,Death of a Salesman,A Definitive Production,"I saw this but once. The performances were so truthful, so honest, so painful, that I can't read the play any more without seeing and hearing Dustin Hoffman, or John Malkovitch. I can't but hear Charles Durning repeat, ""Nobody dast blame this man."" It is a landmark production of a landmark play. Much has been made about Hoffman's ""alternative vision"" of Willy Loman. He's small and somewhat of a nebbish. Lee J. Cobb's and Fredric March's characters were large, slow-moving, imposing, and beaten down. Hoffman proves that just as there can be hundreds of ways to stage the play, there can be as many ways of acting a part while arriving at the same truth. I can't recommend this enough.",,andrae_90,2003/08/20,2,1
1617,Interstellar,Less than stellar by at least 5 dimensions,"I got something out of this movie. I really did. It was 35 degrees Celsius outside the cinema and all I needed was a three hour nap in cool air-conditioning. Lucky me! The latest Nolan film, just there for the taking. It started off as I hoped it would, all dusty on the porch of some ranch in the middle of the U.S. otherwise known as nowhere, the end of the world syrupy American-style, little kid tugging at the heart strings - my eyelids already beginning to droop even before Coop and his daughter Murph wind up at some place that some old cockney and his very Jewish daughter inhabit (guess it only happens in movies with a blind casting director), but that was fine, I was almost in REM sleep - not having been able to process a word of dialogue from McConaughey in over 20 minutes. Pure bliss. And it got even better from an insomniac's point of view. Thanks to an absurd plot and woefully unimaginative CGI effects, my chin was almost on my chest when they landed on the first planet the other side of... well, let's just call it credulity. I don't sleep this well at home! Wait! We're going through another Kubrick-style time dimension - didn't we just spend half an hour on this planet re-using some special effects, this time made to look like giant waves, left over from Inception? I think so, but time warps so nicely when you're practically snoring. I think we lost an astronaut somewhere. Maybe that's the game. Who's next? I hope it's the astrophysicist who explains wormholes with a moebius strip he forgets to twist. Either that or it was origami for dummies. Maybe that *was* the guy we just lost - hard to tell, they all act the same. Flat as the dialogue. Thanks guys. Anyway, we can only pray it will be Hathaway soon. She's starting to keep me awake. How can a head bob about so much in weightlessness? But I'm being unfair; I think I remember her trying to act some of this script. Brave move from an Oscar winner. I'm starting to want my money back. Anyway, I'm roused a bit now and thus a bit grumpy. We're in another galaxy's version of Antarctica minus the faintest signs of life - this despite (because of?) the unzipping of a new bad actor. Fortunately, this actor goes even beyond his usual leaden deadness and I'm soon starting to lose consciousness again and time travel merrily back to the land of nod. I think there was a plot twist involved because this astronaut is trying to do a Dave and HAL routine. He must think he's in a good movie. Poor sod. Did I mention there must have been yards of Inception on the cutting-room floor last time because I'm watching more and more outtakes? Gotta save a few million here and there. I had a dream. I dreamed that Nolan would come up with a slew of insanely bizarre plot twists right at the end that would explain the entire reason for watching this flick. But they carried me out on a stretcher before I found out if it was true. Apparently, I was having a nightmare screaming ""Morse Code! No! No! No! Not Morse Code! That's Spielberg!"" at the top of my lungs and disturbing the other patrons' naps. I was obviously paying too much attention even comatose.",1.0,terrypeck,2014/11/21,1024,458

That really surprised me! Any horror fan with kids will get a real kick out of this one. And even non-horror fans should find the story cute. Sandler and company really pull it together for this one, after their last couple of films were less then stellar.

I wish it was even longer or they made a part 2! It had a slight Blade Runner or Alien feel to it which the director, Duncan Jones, states. I heard MUTE will have more of this feeling so I'm really looking forward to that film. Now some people state that it was too slow paced. Maybe it's just me, but I found that enjoyable, and helped for the unexpected mysteries which lied within. Sam Rockwell played Sam Bell perfectly too. He deserves a lot of credit for nailing that character. It's like you're just following him on his journey trying to figure out and put the pieces together on what is really going on in his world. And, what a unique and fascinating world it is! I also enjoyed Kevin Spacey as the voice of ""Gerty"". What else can I say without giving it away except watch it!

Well seldom do i get the chance where i find myself sitting in a cinema anxious and intrigued by what might come. In a time where trailers are omnipresent and going to the movies without having seen one seems unreasonable, outright stupid to some i had the magical chance to find myself in front of the IMAX on a cold November night with 2 tickets to Interstellar. My only knowledge was that Nolan directed it and McConaughey stars in it. The images were brilliant the acting was top notch and everything was blended together by Hans Zimmer and his Music. 169 minutes flew by me with my eyes fixed on the screen and my heart racing. And there it was.. The ending. I couldn't believe it . I was reliving, rethinking the movie while the credit scenes rolled enjoying the moment, the smell of popcorn, my comfortable seat and what do i see next to me? Ninety percent of the people in the cinema rushing outside after the first second of the credit scenes. .. . Well apparently people enjoy movies different than i do.

1623,Detachment,The solitude of teachers and pupils,"I'm glad I watched it despite the fact different people said it was too depressing. It's an excellent film about education, about the high school system and the educators' helplessness. Adrien Brody is Henry Barthes, a substitute teacher, who, for profound sadness rooted in his childhood, doesn't want to remain too long or too deep with anyone or anything. Marcia Gay Harden is the school bitter principal Carol Dearden who doesn't understand how much she cares until it's taken away from her. Each of the teachers, except one -James Caan as Mr. Charles Seaboldt, is solitary, suffering, on the verge of insanity. And then there are the pupils, rude, violent, with no boundaries. They too are sad, sad, sad, we realize, and if they are not sad, their life is hard or they have no future. Despite all this,Brody as Barthes has beautiful moments of compassion, and he forms bonds with one student and one minor working as a whore. He also has very ambivalent relationships with his hospitalized grandfather. All these bonds lead somewhere, not necessarily good or bad, but humane, and this makes the whole movie worthwhile. Comparing with The Class (2008) it has a much more solid narrative, and unlike The Class it does not try to appear as a documentary. I think that in The Class did not take a POV of a teacher and his limited perspective, so you got to see more of the pupils' lives. It stated specific social problems more than treated the general state of affairs. As a film, Detachment is more solid with better acting, pacing and story. As a social warning, perhaps The Class is stronger.",8.0,avital-gc-1,2015/08/13,2,2
1624,Taxi Driver,"""Here is a man who would not take it anymore"".","In a calculated exercise, I watched ""Raging Bull"" and ""Taxi Driver"" back to back today. Two classics, and two films generally recognized by critics and fans to be among the best of all time. Personally, I think Bull was the better showcase for both De Niro and director Scorsese as the four years between films allowed both to improve on their respective crafts. In terms of favorites, that might be a moot point, as both are darkly disturbing and violent films, with main characters that aren't particularly honorable, much less likable. Indeed, both characters, the fictional Travis Bickle and the real life Jake La Motta were haunted by personal demons that manifested as forms of mental illness. La Motta's brand of violence was legal inside the ring, what he carried into his personal life resulted in a lifetime of unintended consequences. The outcomes of fictional characters can be manipulated to suit the priority of the writer or director, so in the case of ""Taxi Driver"", the protagonist winds up as sort of a hero, at least to the parents of twelve year old hooker Iris. I'm not sure if the point of the film had anything to do with showing how one's life can turn on a second's notice or not. However when Bickle's assassination attempt on Palantine (Leonard Harris) was foiled, the succeeding events could have led to his own demise. Instead he's reborn, sort of. One could sequel the story after Betsy (Cybil Shepherd) gets a cab ride from Travis at the end of the picture, but it's probably better left to the viewer's imagination. A tiny detail caught my eye in both pictures today which I'm sure I would never have considered had I seen them days or weeks apart. In the carnage of the shootout scene, when the cops make their presence in the doorway of the rented room, Bickle puts a bloody finger to his head simulating a gunshot, and two drops of blood drip from his finger. Scorsese used the same device again in ""Raging Bull"", when Jake La Motta is badly bloodied in his final fight against Sugar Ray Robinson. As the boxer sags against the ring ropes, the camera focuses on the top rope a few inches away from La Motta's outstretched arm. Two drops of blood fall from the rope to the canvas to further intensify La Motta's defeat. At the time, I couldn't say why I found that to be so fascinating, but now I do.",9.0,classicsoncall,2011/04/16,19,12

1627,Blackfish,Many nearby locales and shots give this movie credibility,"Perhaps a little preachy, but essentially right-on expose' of one of the nastier roadside zoo type companies around. Sea World was shown the door in Washington because of the numbers of whales they killed trying to capture a few for their parks. As against elephants or ostriches or other exotics, killer whales are fairly easy to see in their natural environment. All you have to do is come to where they like to hang out and go out on a whale watch boat. Sea World, if it were responsibly run, might have a case for what it's doing now as long as it doesn't trap any more wild animals. But the spin, the bullshit and outright false information, shows that their chief interest is in the almighty buck, not taking care of wildlife or even their own staff. Sea World seems to be continuing a vestige of old-fashioned zoo attitudes that once gave us bears in chains dancing at county fairs, especially when they confine these animals to such small enclosures. It may be true that animals born in captivity know nothing of life in the wild, but they're still physically equipped for that life, and can and should be returned to the wild. This is not because we can do that, but because we should, just as we should be about cleaning up our act so there's enough fish for these creatures to eat. In the wild. In the beginning and toward the end of the film there are local Washington state shots, even one that shows one well-known bull, ""Ruffles,"" and others of his pod in their natural environment, one I can almost look at directly (but for the trees) from where I sit writing this. So if Se World wants to do this right, assuming it can be done ""right,"" it wouldn't cost any more money (their basic value) to tell the truth and offer good solid scientific information, instead of making it all into one more consumerist game.",9.0,jack98230,2013/08/19,15,13

1630,The Fault in Our Stars,TV drama of the week,"Don't get me wrong, I did notice that there are a lot of people who ""enjoyed"" this and declared this as their favorite movie of 2014 (or at least the month they watched this). Unfortunately I couldn't see it that way, which has to do with the fact, that this is so by the numbers that it hardly evoked an emotional reaction (once at the airport scene with the father, but several times it was shuddering, because of the sugar overload this has). I actually was under the impression it was another Nicholas Sparks film/novel this was based on. Not because I read this anywhere, but of how the ""story"" ""developed"". No real surprises here, not even that you get beautiful people looking beautiful, while pretending to be something else (or sick). That wouldn't matter though, because even movie sickness is best portrayed by someone we love to watch, but the fact it lies to itself (""you are a fairy tale/movie"" is what someone should tell the voice over, if it actually helped ... but it won't). A far better movie on the subject, which actually does evoke emotion if you get on the ride is ""50/50"". Joseph Gordon Levitt and Anna Kendrick are killing it (sorry for the pun).

While I've heard many people say Moon is boring I must say I was never bored while watching the film. It was an excellent movie experience. The movie sucked me in and I was trapped for the rest of the film. It made me think, it made me sad and a plethora of emotions rushed through me while watching the film. Sam Rockwell seriously got screwed over at the Oscars, because his performance in this movie is just magnificent. Duncan Jones, the director of the movie really set the bar high for his next movies, because this is a science fiction masterpiece.

1633,Crash,Way to taint a good Cronenberg title,"This is not a particularly subtle movie. And I'm not such a particularly big fan of subtlety either. Of course, when the lack of subtlety is not a choice but feels more like lack of confidence, lack of experience in envisioning a movie or even plain lack of smarts, it begins to annoy me. When Crash started, I was fairly interested on it. About 20 minutes in, Paul Haggis had killed any sort of appeal his so-called characters and so-called film-making resources could've had, and I was bored. An hour later, it had become unintentional comedy. Fortunately, I was with a friend, so we got a chance to have some whispered laughs. Haggis is telling a choral story driving about twenty so-called characters through the streets of L.A. While I frankly don't know much about the movies of people like Altman and P.T. Anderson (I've only seen M.A.S.H., Gosford Park and Punch-drunk love), I can see why people bring up their names while talking about Crash. In particular, there's a way of using music tracks and editing to connect different characters, dramatic situations and ways of living that's a desperate effort to resemble those more talented directors. The movie shoves these characters around, telling us snippets of their lives, which are 24/7 dedicated to discriminating people from other races or discussing their views on race. There's a black cop played by Don Cheadle, a white politician played by Brendan Fraser with a white and very very racist wife played by Sandra Bullock, a proud-to-be-black black sitcom actress played by Thandie Newton and some other people. All in all, as I said, they're about twenty, I think, and they keep bumping into each other so often that I think none else lives on L.A. apart from them. And they all really really hate each other. What does it all amount to? Well, at the beginning of the movie, Don Cheadle (who does the best acting in the movie and has the only remotely interesting role, everything has to be said) says ""In LA, nobody touches you. We're always behind this metal and glass. I think we miss that touch so much, that we crash into each other, just so we can feel something"". I think that pretty much summarizes everything. Well, that, and the comfortable and supposedly meaningful dogma that everyone has a good and a bad side. So, every character in the movie will do one very very nasty thing and one very very good thing. A cop who's offended by the racism of his partner will shoot a black dude because he assumes he's about to pull a gun. The racist cop that's not above pulling a wealthy black/black couple, probably thinking it's a black/white one (Thandie Newton has kinda light skin) will be a good boy to his father who can't pee and save the same woman's life later. It's all really really contrived, really really reiterative and really really lame. On the positive side, Crash is shorter than you probably expect it to be. If you'd like to see a social drama done wrong, just for the fun of it, it almost works as a textbook example and you don't waste much time. Let me get this straight, before I get accused of something myself  I get what Crash is trying to say, that racism on all of its forms still survives in modern society, concealed as it might be, and that everyone, even not all that bad people, might be guilty of it at any given time. I even agree with it. I just think Haggis did such a poor job of conveying his message that it might even be interpreted wrong. Some of the more supposedly affecting or tough scenes in the movie are so clumsily made and lack so many different kinds of build-up and motivation that you'll pretty likely laugh your ass off at them. Osama guy shooting the little girl with fake bullets and the staring at the gun for a really really long time? Sandra Bullock falling through the stairs? THAI SLAVES COMING OUT OF A TRUCK?

Portrayed is a wonderful image of rural France, and it is a must see for anyone remotely linked with classical choral backgrounds, or France itself.

The characters were all very imaginative and cute. I like all the references and jokes throughout the film. However, it is somewhat predictable as Mavis is the typical teenage girl character longing for ""a whole new world"" but stuck under an overprotective father, along the lines of earlier animated films like The Little Mermaid (1989) or Aladdin (1992). The other character Johnny was sometimes endearing and sometimes annoying and forced - his character was quite inconsistent.

1636,Pulp Fiction,A cinematic masterpiece,"Way better than the other films of Tarantino. A cinematic that will be studied for centuries to come. It is bold,sexy,unique,dialogue driven and mesmerizing. A masterfully crafted film where loose ends are tide beautifully which is one of the most innovative things and Tarantino masters the storytelling. The dialogues are excellent, I loved those moments when they talked about Royale with cheese,divine intervention,pigs,tony rocky horror and others. A perfect blend of crime and comedy which makes it a cornerstone of cinema and is rightfully regarded as one of the greatest motion pictures of all time and definitely Tarantino's masterpiece and my favourite movie ever. I laughed out loud when Marvin was shot in the face.😂 Those who are giving negative reviews are light hearted,stupid and have no idea about cinema. This is not glorifying racism and homophobia, it presents a dark reality perfectly embedded with lots and lots of humour. Travolta,Jackson, Uma and Bruce Willis were outstanding.

1637,The Fault in Our Stars,The fault is the script,"It is nearly impossible to make a film about terminal illness and not make it heartfelt. The Fault in Our Stars has its heart in the right place but – WOW! – you walk out wishing that someone would shake the dust and clutter and broken fragments off the screenplay so it can flow with more efficiency. Here is a movie that is so busy being profound that the characters feel trapped by plot gimmicks and stale dialogue. Based on the bestselling book by John Greene, the movie stars the talented Shailene Woodly as Hazel Grace Lancaster, a teenager with Stage 4 thyroid cancer with metastasis forming in her lungs. She's been living with this disease since she was 13, and now she lugs around an oxygen tank with a nasal cannula. Hazel is distant, a bit surly and more than a little bit cynical about the world. In other words, she's a normal teenager. Her parents force her to attend a cancer survivor support group that is led by an overly emotional group leader who begins each session by unrolling a large rug with a big – and somewhat unnerving – picture of Jesus on it. One day in group she meets Augustus Waters (Ansel Elgort), a fellow teen who confidently announces that he is suffering from osteosarcoma which has already claimed the lower part of his right leg. He's a nice guy that Hazel meet-cutes when she bumps into him in the hallway. There is little resistance from either side as to how they feel about one another and in the blink of an eye, they fall in love. That's more or less all that you need to know. The connection between Hazel and Augustus is not really built on chemistry but on the fact that they both suffer from terminal illness. The movie doesn't have the flow of real life, but is built on conventions of the plot. Everything in their relationship is calculated for effect, we get gimmicks instead of narrative. For example, Augustus carries around a pack of cigarettes and occasionally puts one in his mouth. Hazel is disgusted but Augustus offers this explanation: ""They don't kill you unless you light them. And I've never lit one. It's a metaphor, see: You put the killing thing right between your teeth, but you don't give it the power to do its killing. A metaphor."" That's fine, but the sight of Augustus with the cigarette in his mouth looks as ridiculous as it sounds. He puts the unlit cigarette in his mouth so often that we want to take his away from him and say ""STOP THAT!!"" The movie is loaded with strange moments like that. There is an odd subplot about a book that Hazel has read over and over by a mysterious author named Peter Van Haughton who has apparently disappeared into seclusion somewhere in Amsterdam. After a long and pointless series of arguments with doctors and with Hazel's parent, she and Augustus accept an invitation to fly to Amsterdam to meet him. Van Haughton is played in an angry performance by Willem DeFoe that seems shoe-horned in as if he were visiting from a different movie. Worse is what comes next. Hazel and Augustus visit Anne Frank's house. Naturally, Hazel has trouble climbing the series of steep staircases. When she reaches the famous attic, there is little to no attention paid to the fact that they are in Anne Frank's famous hiding place. Instead, the scene climaxes with Hazel and Augustus's first kiss, to which all the strangers around them begin to applaud. The movie never really deals with the issue of what it is like to live with cancer, or the inevitability that it will claim your life. The dialogue lightly dances around these issues but no one ever gets serious about discussing them. They know they're going to die but neither Augustus nor Hazel ever get down to the serious business of discussing what lies on the other side. Augustus talks a lot about ""oblivion"", which indicates that he is an atheist, but the movie doesn't go there. We know from the beginning that one or both characters will face the final curtain before the movie is over, but the film's final act is a long – very long – series of slow passages about eulogies and final wishes that goes on and on and on. It should be moving us to tears but you find yourself checking your watch instead. Hazel informs us in the beginning that ""Pain deserves to be felt."" We agree, but the movie could do with a lot more pain and a lot less catharsis. The characters talk and talk and talk and talk, but nothing they have to say has any real meaning. Death is the inevitability of this story, but there's such a long and drawn-out funerary tone to the film's third act that is tinged with so much hope and finality that it feels like the happiest sad ending you've ever seen.",,The_Film_Cricket,2014/06/07,104,58
1638,Detachment,An outstanding film,"I think many of the negative reviews for this film look far too deeply into the film. Yes, many of the actions portrayed by the students should have ended in repercussions, but that wasn't what the film was trying to portray. It was about a substitute teacher who didn't want to get emotionally attached to anything or anybody, and through his journey, he became attached to several people. I truly felt the emotions of the film throughout, and would highly recommend it to anybody looking to watch a film that brings out a sense of reality.

In addition to having great common themes, i.e., don't give up, don't be afraid to pursue your dreams and don't be a victim of your circumstances, October Sky is an excellent example of what many fathers and sons go through together. I sat down with my son to watch this movie. He loved the pursuit of the dream, the adventure of the boys and at the end, when Homer's father comes to watch the final rocket launch and put his arms around his boy, my son turned and looked at me and understood exactly why I wanted to watch this movie with him. Not many movies can entertain and teach at the same time without being heavy handed. The Director's handling of the father/son relationship was right on. I also love Natalie Cannerday as the mom.

1646,Horrible Bosses 2,Surprised,"I had low expectations going into this film, having watched the first again just hours before only to be disappointed with how little of the film I found funny this time. This being the first time seeing 2, I pleasantly enjoyed it. What surprised me the most was Chris Pine's psychotic performance - one great moment of the film is when Kurt yells that Rex is ""fight-clubbing"" himself (watch Fight Club by the way, great film and it will only make the joke funnier). From this moment and many others like this, 2 is similar to 1 in that it is a meta- film; it is not about making movies but discusses pop culture and the characters recognize crucial plot moments in the film saying ""this is the part where..."" or ""what a great twist"" and so forth. Meta-films have the effect of reflecting on themselves, reminding the audience that this is fiction, and while I have discussed this recently in class I'm not sure whether it necessarily makes a film ""better,"" but it is interesting to think about. What I both liked and disliked about the film is that it made use of jokes and similar plot structure from the first film. It was amusing to hear Harken use the ""50 states"" quote from the first film, but that made the film seem to rely on old material in order to be funny, and this isn't even clever like how 22 Jump Street actually made fun of the fact that it was a sequel. The plot structure relied on imitating that of the first film in certain ways which really brought my enjoyment down since it could not be more original - but at least it wasn't an EXACT copy like The Hangover Part 2. I was also surprised with what this film was able to do visually with a few different montages and the transitions between segments of those montages. My verdict is that Chris Pine was surprisingly the best part of this movie, and overall, even though I rate it higher mainly because the jokes of the first have grown old on me, it is as good as Horrible Bosses. 3.0/4.0",7.0,robsta23,2015/02/12,14,8
1647,Crash,Spoon feeding at it's Hollywood best,This movie is certainly not much of a challenge for anyone who would rather think than be spoon fed. Such an improbable series of events has not occurred since the last time the circus came to town. Some good acting but not redeemed by the contrived and full of holes script. It's hard to fathom just how this ho-hum movie beat out so many good candidates for Best Picture. This award by the Academy will go down as one of its most misdirected. This movie gathering praise reminds me of why I've just about stopped going to see Hollywood films. They pander far too much for my taste.

1648,Interstellar,Simply awful,"The most pointless pack of poo ever made. If you enjoy science fiction do not watch this dog under any circumstances. It was like a very long boring sappy, idiotic episode of the twilight zone. Gravity and time transmitted across dimensions, and lest we forget also love, FFS what kind of moron wrote this drivel. I guess that cosmically transmitted love is the reason there is no military in the future, even though resources are beyond scarce. And hmmmm what seems more difficult, using NASA's technology to transform a barely habitable planet circling a black hole, (with no sun FFS) or to transform, what was that other planet? Oh that's right Earth. I see no need to detail the rest of the stupidity of the ""physics"" in this movie. They should have simply made McMconaughey a wizard, it would have made more sense. But I must mention the magical space ship that can achieve escape velocity from a planet with 130% of Earth's gravity, ummm why didn't they use that rather than a massive 3 stage rocket to escape Earth?",1.0,pattyp-725-58249,2015/01/26,107,52

1650,Primal Fear,The birth of a star and the resurrection of another,"It's not often that viewers get a chance to watch a star being born - that a talented unknown actor's performance that is so spectacular it leads to the A-list in one role is rare: Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman, Brad Pitt in Thelma & Louise to name a recent few. But Edward Norton's turn as the ""defendant/victim"" in Primal Fear is one of those ""Wow"" moments that leaves the audience salivating for his next performance. In this feature debut, Norton outdistances his role, as does Richard Gere, in a resurrection no less impressive than Norton's star-making turn. Heretofore, Gere has specialized in assorted intelligent professional cad roles. Here, he gets a chance to inhabit one that not only wears his dubious character on his sleeve, but wears it, drives it, drinks it... revels in it. Yeah, sure somewhere there's a heart of gold, but like his client, the layers on top serve him better, and the heart of gold is tarnished. Gere is at his peak, comfortably, cheerfully inhabiting the role. Laura Linney deserves extra credit for often being the ice-queen foil which propels the two male characters' development; her own character is rather one- dimensional, but she herself squeezes as much dazzle as she can from it. Even though everyone else obviously falls for whatever Gere's Vail purrs into their ears, it's merely enough time for Linney's Janet to get a drag on her ubiquitous cigarette; another step in what will (hopefully) someday be film's love affair with her. Wasted, sadly, are fine character actors like John Mahoney, Steven Bauer, Maura Tierney & Andre Braugher who could have lit up the screen had they not been handed scripts with generic character stereotypes. See it to watch the ascension of Norton and Gere.",,advixen,2004/05/08,209,183
1651,The Fault in Our Stars,"The Fault Is Not in Our Stars, But in Ourselves??","The Fault in Our Stars was good. It was funny and certainly heart gripping. I thought Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort did a great job. Overall the story itself was magnificent, albeit there were several faults in the film itself. The editing was awkward at times and there were noticeable contradictory mistakes that I will not dwell on other than to say (without spoiling anything) that there is a teleporting basketball trophy... See if you can spot it!! I also felt that the framing was too narrow at times and some of the two frame shots were unnecessary and distracting. My last and largest problem was that there is a huge difference in what works in a book and what works on film. Some scenes can feel odd – and that is because they are out of place. In addition, the themes could have been much stronger and left us in really thinking. Sadly the film did not quite make it. I may be focusing too much on the negatives. I did rather enjoy the film and thought the book was fantastic. I would recommend it to anyone contemplating. Enjoy!",7.0,naxt1114,2014/06/05,59,33
1652,Primal Fear,"Good film, with a then unknown Edward Norton, who steals the show","Edward Norton truly is a genius. He carries a lot of this film's magnificence and is the most memorable actor in this film. The story itself is of course not bad either and the performances of the rest of the cast are good too, but there was not a lot of excitement in this film. Nor was there a character I could relate to in a way. Still this film is pretty good and that is due ONLY to the great performance of Edward Norton. Norton is (my guess is as good as yours) the actor of the 21st century, for he had played a number of truly memorable and great characters. Though his films are no blockbusters he is a recognised and worshipped actor, not only by fellow actors, critics (two Oscar nominations at the age of 31), but also among the people around the world for his roles in The People vs. Larry Flint, American History X, and Fight Club. Maybe even Rounders too, but that is maybe his worst performance. I have not yet seen Keep the Faith which he also directed, produced plus starred in, but I'm sure it is good and I know I will see a lot of other good films featuring this young, fine actor. As for this film, this is the worst of the five I have mentioned and seen Edward Norton in and what is my verdict then you wonder, well hold on to the grade Norton's worst' film gets from me. 7 out of 10",8.0,stamper,2000/09/02,20,13
1653,Spider-Man 2,Spider-man 2 A Much Better Than Expected Sequel,"Spider-man 2 was a much better than expected sequel. It's better than the original with more improved special effects, humor, a nasty villain, and more intense action. Director Sam Raimi did a great job of making this sequel which is the best of the three films. Spider-man 3 unfortunately was the worst of the trilogy. This one however is definitely worth seeing because it's that good. Tobey Maguire reprises his role as Peter Parker/Spider-man and he continues to be a good choice for the character. Peter's now in college and what he wants more than anything is a normal life but his character feels a duty to protect people with his amazing arachnid abilities. Kristen Dunst returns as Mary Jane and she's okay in the part but like the previous one she isn't good much to do except eventually being the lady in distress again later on in the film. James Franco is back again as Harry Osbourn who blames Spider-man for his father's death. Franco does a decent job as Harry but like Dunst he isn't given much to do and his character lacks screen time. Alred Molina joins the cast as brilliant scientist Otto Octavious who after a freak accident becomes Doc Ock because of four mechanic arms melded to his back. Molina like Dafoe makes for a menacing villain and is well developed. Also his character fortunately doesn't have a corny costume like the Green Golbin did in the original. No offense. Rosemary Harris also reprises her supporting role as Peter's Aunt May. She isn't really given much to do either but Rosemary Harris makes the best of her limited screen time and Bruce Campbell shows up once again in a cameo appearance as a theater usher. The special effects are an improvement over the first one and so are the action/ fight sequences most of them between Spider-man and his nemesis Doc Ock. The one standing out is of course their fight that starts off on a skyscraper near a giant clock and then on top of a speeding train thats grows more intense as their confrontation escalates toward it's conclusion. The final showdown between Spider-man and Doc Ock near the end was a bit of a letdown compared to train one but everything else that happened before in the movie made up for the somewhat rushed conclusion. The pacing in between the action was a little slow at times and the dialogue wasn't the best occasionally problems that the original had too but this sequel is still a very good movie. It was much better than expected and I was fairly impressed with the film overall. Spider-man 2 is one of the best sequels (besides The Dark Knight, and T2 Judgement Day) out there with just the right amount of well balanced intense action, character development, humor, drama, some suspense, and impressive performances by the cast especially Molina that's sure to please almost any comic book fan.",9.0,tburke85,2009/06/09,8,6

1655,Horrible Bosses 2,"No ... seriously, just no!","Okay, maybe I shouldn't have watched this so soon after watching the first one for the second time (though why I actually did that is beyond me), because I literally got to the point where I simply wanted to scream in agony, and the main reason was because it was just so painful to watch our protagonists go about acting like complete jerks. Sure, that was the point of the movie, but sitting through this film watching a bunch of bumbling idiots stumble from one stupid scene to the next just made me want to twist and turn in agony, yet for some bizarre reason I watched it to the end (then again I am one of those people that will rarely, if ever, stop watching a film halfway through). Well, I have now finished watching the film, so I can legitimately write a review of it, and I can honestly tell the entire world to simply not bother at all – this film is rubbish, painful, all copies of it should be destroyed and it should never see the light of day again. In fact I am surprised that I gave the first movie as high a rating as I did because in all honestly the original film wasn't all that much better. Okay, our idiotic protagonists are a little more tolerable in the original, but only barely. This film has our protagonists trying to start up their own business manufacturing something called the 'shower buddy', but since they are not really cold, hard, and experienced businessmen, they end up getting taken for a ride and find themselves deeply in debt. So, as is the case with the previous film, they decide to take matters into their own hands to attempt to solve the problem by breaking the law, though as it turns out they end up escaping any real penalty. Personally, I wouldn't recommend this at all. Sure, maybe it is that I simply don't like the bumbling idiot type of comedy, and after watching this film I can clearly state that I really don't like this type of comedy. The other thing is that they are basically getting much cruder, and much more offensive, though not offensive in the sense that Southpark is offensive, but rather attempting to be like that and failing miserably.

However, considering how wonderful the journey is and how well executed everything is, the occasional predictability is NOT a detriment--in fact, it's nice that the film works out the way you hope. The film is about a teacher at a residential school for troubled boys in 1949. The kids are angry and the atmosphere of the school oppressive. The new guy doesn't have all the answers, but he is decent and the kids slowly respond to this. In addition, he adores music and decides to channel the kids' energy into a chorus. Unfortunately, throughout his stay at the school, the headmaster does a lot to try to undo the good that is done and he seems to genuinely hate the children. Despite this, the teacher and the kids seem to overcome this atmosphere of tension through their music. The music, by the way, is exquisite. Even if you don't understand French, it is marvelous to hear and greatly adds to the overall feeling of the film. Wonderful and heart-felt throughout--but somehow manages not to be sickeningly sweet or contrived.",9.0,MartinHafer,2006/05/08,3,2

I later watched the trailer for it on this site and that alone was enough to move me to own it. This was definitely a great way to launch (no pun intended) Jake Gyllenhaal's career and one of the best movies, if not THE best, that he will have ever done. If you look at Gyllenhaal's profile and click on the genre section, you will see that ""October Sky"" is (so far) the only family work he has ever done. To me that is a sad but true illustration of the choices that some actors and actresses make these days and they should do these more often. The movie doesn't entirely feel like a family movie due to a bit of rough language, so I am taking away two stars.",8.0,phanatic87,2007/12/04,1,1

Her mother Frannie (Laura Dern) encourages her to go to a cancer support group against her will. However, when Hazel meets the eighteen year-old Gus (Ansel Elgort), who lost part of one leg with cancer but apparently is cured, they fall in love with each other.

Gus contacts him and Van Houten invites them to visit him in Amsterdam. They travel to Netherlands with Frannie where Hazel will learn that things are not like they seem to be. ""The Fault in Our Stars"" is a tiresome and too long romance. The story has a promising beginning, sort of Gus Van Sant's ""Restless"" and supported by the good performances and chemistry of the young lead couple, but the film should have been edited to become shorter. In the end, it becomes a melodramatic Mexican soap opera. My vote is six. Title (Brazil): ""A Culpa é das Estrelas"" (""The Fault is from the Stars"")",6.0,claudio_carvalho,2014/11/01,24,13
1660,Intermission,"Dublin, warts and all","You would never think it from watching movies set in Dublin, but most Dubliners don't live in public housing projects, or talk with that godawful nasal whine euphemistically known as a Dublin accent (just like not all Londoners are cockneys.) Unfortunately, thanks to Roddy Doyle and his potboilers, ""gurrier chic"" is all the rage. The ""gurrier with the heart of gold"" is the new cinematic cliche and all the uglier, seamier aspects of life in working-class Dublin - the joyriding gangs, the drugs and violence, the staggering levels of racism against new immigrants, the mindless aping of all that's worst about English and US mass ""culture"" - are airbrushed out. Usually the presence of Colm Meaney in a movie is the kiss of death - it guarantees the sort of maudlin Dubbelin-in-de-rare-owl-toymes sentimentality that makes me toss my cookies. There's plenty of that in Intermission, but there is also a welcome note of realism at times. Brutal mindless thugs like Farrell's character, and the stone-throwing brat, are all too common, as are surly, bovine shop assistants and tinpot-dictator policemen. As for the story, it is wildly implausible and depends totally on over-the-top coincidences. However, it is quite funny and if you are in the right mood you will enjoy it. The sappy ending in the pub almost spoiled it for me, but the scene during the closing credits, featuring Noeleen and her husband, redeemed it.",,misha-lemass,2004/05/10,6,1
1661,Taxi Driver,Excellent,"A lonely Vietnam veteran who has insomnia spends his nights as a taxi driver in the dirty streets of New York, where he encounters a young prostitute who he tries to help make a difference. This is a very good film and one of Martin Scorsese best (Goodfellas being my fave). An excellent portrayal from Robert De Niro as Travis Bickle the cabbie and good performances from Jodie Foster as the child prostitute Iris Steensman, Cybill Shepherd, Peter Boyle and Harvey Keitel as a pimp called Sport. You actually get drawn into the isolation and anger that Travis is feeling towards these lowlifes and because of that you really feel sympathy for him. Though after a while the loneliness and the city really starts to haunt Travis's mind, causing violent instincts and paranoia. This film is filled with such memorable lines e.g.Travis Bickle 'You talking to me? Well I'm the only one here.' and the many powerful scenes that stay in your head after it's finished. The hypnotic cinematography is a standout, as if your seeing the harsh & gritty New York streets and twisted people through the eyes of Travis when he is driving his cab. A great screenplay, a stunning score by Bernard Herrmann and a superb atmosphere created. This is a brutally compelling and bleak look at a decaying and corrupt society of the 70's. An unsettling gem of a film. 5/5",10.0,lost-in-limbo,2004/10/30,276,212
1662,The Green Mile,"True to the book, which is odd for a movie.","Having seen the movie, The Green Mile, and read the novel of the same name by Stephen King, I am glad to say that the movie stays true to the book, which in itself is a great read. I read the book in one setting about a year ago, and after seeing the movie, I didn't see one scene from the book, or one plot point, left out. There were a few minor changes from the book but which in no way detract from either work. As far as performances, I can imagine many people pointing to Michael Duncan as John Coffey or Tom Hanks as Paul Edgecomb as the best performances of the movie, and they are good, but I would hope that Michael Jeter would receive recognition for portraying Eduard Delacroix. He plays Delacroix exactly as I pictured him when I read the book. I can very well see why King himself said this is his favorite of the movies adapted from his novels. It is the only one played out as he had written it. I wouldn't compare this movie or the book to (Rita Hayworth and) The Shawshank Redemption because that would be unfair to both. They are both great, but are both different. The Green Mile isn't a movie about hope and friendship, as The Shawshank Redemption was, it is a movie about a miracle of a man, and the people he affects.

Tobey Maguire is magnificent in this movie and he plays so well off of all the other actors in the movie. Alfred Molina is great as the villain and, as always, J.K.

1665,Primal Fear,"Gere is wonderful, Norton is astounding in a spellbinding tale of secrets and lies","Martin (Richard Gere) is a very successful attorney in the Chicago area. However, his workaholic and limelight-seeking tendencies ruined one relationship with an underling (Laura Linney). Now comes the case of all cases. The archbishop of Chicago has been brutally murdered and the suspect is an innocent looking vagrant named Aaron (Edward Norton). Martin decrees that he MUST represent Aaron so he offers the young man his services pro bono, knowing the publicity for the trial will place them both squarely in the news for weeks and weeks. Yet, there is much evidence against Aaron. Despite his stuttering and guiltless demeanor, is Aaron truly not the killer? And, what is more important, justice or winning a case? This is a great, great movie, in many diverse ways. First, the performances are outstanding, with Gere giving a fine turn as the hotshot lawyer and Norton truly jawdropping as the murder suspect who looks like a choirboy. Linney does a nice turn as the district attorney and the other cast members are very well chosen, too. The Chicago setting shows the place as it is, a mixture of both wealthy and dismally poor neighborhoods. Costumes, especially Gere's lawyer garb, are very nice. Then, too, the script, based on a novel by William Diehl, is first rate and full of twists and turns, with a stunning maneuver at the finale. There are a few brief scenes of graphic violence, as the murder itself comes quite near the film's beginning, so there may be moments when you need to look away from the screen, if you are a bit squeamish. Also, if you are Catholic, there may be some parts of the story that are a bit offensive. But, all in all, if you love Gere or you long for interesting, intelligent thrillers, you should not miss Primal Fear. Why don't you speed off toward the video store and pluck this winner from the shelves tonight?",8.0,inkblot11,2007/04/14,7,6
1666,Primal Fear,Absolutely top notch courtroom drama,"I would rate this as one of top court room films I've ever seen. Even after having seen it 3 times, and knowing the plot twists, I find this film to be ""riveting"". Begin with a darned good story line. Young man who has been living under the auspices of a Catholic Archbishop murders the Archbishop. Immediate conclusion -- the Archbishop is have sex with older alter boys. Oops...not quite...but there is sexual angle...just not the one expected. Then, someone murders the prelate...an alter boy is arrested because he appears to be fleeing, had access, and eventually we learn he had motive. But...he has a split personality...so he gets off with time in a mental hospital. But then... In addition to a superb script and excellent dialog, what made this film click for me was a terrific cast. Richard Gere is in top form as the defense attorney...certainly one of his very best performances. Laura Linney is just as strong as the prosecuting attorney (and former love interest of Gere...which adds spice to the interplay between the two). John Mahoney (""dad"" on ""Frazier"") appears to be a suspect and does some pretty good sweating on the stand. Alfre Woodard is excellent as the Judge. Frances McDormand is good as the psychiatrist. And, Edward Norton is interesting as the suspect. Andre Braugher and Maura Tierney are along as good assistants to Gere. Frankly, you can't ask for much more in a cast. To be honest, it's difficult for me to think of anything to criticize here. Highly recommended!",8.0,vincentlynch-moonoi,2013/06/19,2,2
1667,Moon,"Valiant Effort, Flawed Story","*Spoiler Alert* What can I say? Based on the high praise that Moon received from critics and fans alike, I had high expectations going in. Sam Rockwell gives a fine performance as the hapless Sam Bell(s), the miniatures- driven special effects are very well executed, and Duncan Jones has definitely done his homework- referencing sci-fi greats like 2001, Outland, Blade Runner, and others. So what's the problem? For starters there's definitely some flawed story logic. I find it very difficult to believe that cost of training and employing new workers for the mining operation would be that prohibitively expensive, especially considering that it only takes one person to staff the base. Overlooking that, if Lunar's goal was to save money by not having to train new workers for their mining operations, why not simply automate the entire process? By the looks of things, the operation was already almost completely automated. GERTY (the computer) seemed like a sufficiently sophisticated AI to oversee the day to day operations and fix problems as they arose, and with an abundant fusion power source they could have had a fleet of redundant ""mining bots"" ready if one of them encountered a catastrophic mechanical failure. In the rare event something did go wrong that required human attention, they could simply send a repair team. In any case, either one of the above scenarios would be much easier and less expensive than: A) Developing human-cloning technology. B) Finding a way to prematurely age the clones to adulthood. C) Finding a way to ""program"" their brains with the memories of a particular individual. D) Creating hundreds (if not more) copies of them and keeping them in cryogenic stasis. This seems like a highly-implausible level of technology for the near future, but assuming that Lunar had cracked the secrets of directly programming the human brain (in all it's incredible complexity), this only bolsters the idea that they could have programmed some type of AI to run the operations, rather than creating an army of human clones. I realize of course that the idea of clones and their ethical treatment is central to the premise of the movie, but I just wish that more thought had gone into making the circumstances more plausible. My other main gripe with this movie is that I feel that many of it's devices seemed derivative. I know that the similarities between the look and portrayal of GERTY to '2001's HAL were a bit of intentional audience misdirection on Jones' part but come on...could he have at least tried to be subtle? The countdown to the arrival of the repair team/assassins was right out of Outland. The concept of artificially- created humans with a built-in short lifespan was right out of Blade Runner. Unchecked capitalism and devalued human lives...countless movies within the sci-fi genre, but most directly lifted from Alien(s) and Outland. I'm not saying that it isn't okay for directors/writers to pay homage to other science fiction films or touch on classic oft-explored themes, but please do so with enough restraint so as to prevent the viewer from engaging in an involuntary game of ""spot the reference"". I really wanted to like this movie, and I hate to disparage it when it's clear that Jones' was making an honest effort at creating the kind of intelligent science fiction so often ignored by Hollywood. Better luck next time.",6.0,bmwmail-1,2010/03/02,30,18
1668,Blackfish,The soul is same as you are but a different species.,"One of the fine documentary with a fine message. Snubbed from the Oscars and I felt really bad for that. It should have been in there compared to the other nominees, including the winner. This was like another 'The Cove' which spotlights the human torture to the non human species. This documentary is not for entertainment, but which brings the public awareness of the serious issue that still taking place around the world in different venues. The movie was committed to expose on the imprisoned Orca, a killer whale called Tilikum and the company called 'Sea World' it owns. It all began from his capture in 1983 on the coast of Iceland, then brought back to the United States to train. In his 30 years of captivity Tilikum was involved in the deaths of his trainers, but the statement to the press and media was denoted as it was the human error. And also the movie had many heartbreaking incidents in many parts. When I first heard about this movie I thought it was going to uncover the crime committed by the large Blackfish. As usual like most of the occasion my guess was wrong and I was totally surprised towards the story that tried to reveal some unexpected and unbearable truths. Everything reversed and finger points towards human just like the tag says: Never capture what you can't control. Looked like this just below 90 minutes movie was lacking in valuable inputs. Only because of the 'Sea World' that holds Tilikum refused to participate in making of the movie which portrayed them in dark shade. But the intention of the movie was explained in very honestly. There it goes my salute to the director whose attempt was so courageous. In my childhood, I had a fish bowl with a couple of goldfish in it and I regret having it after seeing this documentary movie. Truly an eye opener, whoever watch this would feel similar fashion, especially if you are an animal lover. Hoping this movie will change the perspective of the relationship between man and animals. Expecting more and more movies like this until people realise what's going on between dominated and enslaved species on the planet earth.

1669,The Green Mile,Horrible!,"This must have been the worst movie I have seen in a long time! As I sat in the movie theater watching the people around me starting to sob I really wondered if everybody had gone insane. First of all, I really didn't like how this movie dealt with the topic capital punishment. I hardly doubt the atmosphere in a death tract depicted in ""The Green Mile"" is anything like that in real life. Guards and inmates are buddies? (Except for the one BAD guard and the one BAD inmate, of course!) They're cracking jokes and having fun with a little mouse? Oh please! I had a feeling this movie was bad when it started in that nursing home with that sentimental looking old guy but when John started to cough up that what-ever-it-was-horrible-computer-animation-stuff I knew it was just terrible. The movie is overly sentimental, has a horrible constructed plot (sure, the real killer just happens to be in the cell across to Johns) and lacks any creativity and imagination. I read somewhere that Michael Duncan did a great job in this movie. But frankly all he did was cry and sweat and supporting the horrible stereo type of infantile, good, maybe innocently wise but not very clever blacks.",1.0,ronjart,2000/01/25,181,49

Every single person in the world seem to love this movie, but I don't. I don't enjoy watching a guy killing everyone just cause he's a socially inept psycho, the never ending punching, alright, I got it, that's what the Mafia is all about, I already knew it. The deep-inside-good guy who in the end regrets about it all and sells out his partners. Terrific, I didn't see that coming from miles away. Oh, right, and before that, he cheated on his wife with prostitutes. How original is that? Even when it tries to be funny this movie fails miserably. From the great reviews it has achieved, I can see the world thinks it's amazingly original. Well I guess I'm missing it, and I'm happy I do. I want a plot, something that justifies all the blood, not just the ""he made me angry"". Hahaha, am I supposed to applause and enjoy, right? Yeah, Pesci's character is great, sure. Too bad he got murdered, isn't it?. That's the only part of the movie I've really enjoyed, actually. I would've loved to see him die with even more pain. That would've been great. I'll give the movie 2/10, just because they did shut that annoying dude up anyway. That adds one point.

1672,Pulp Fiction,"Violence and Redemption Underscore ""Pulp Fiction""","""Pulp Fiction"" is considered Quentin Tarantino' masterpiece; both as a writer and director. Although it's not a perfect film and has a couple flaws, ""Pulp Fiction"" has one of the greatest scripts that changed the way films were made. The film opens with a conversation between ""Pumpkin"" and ""Honey Bunny"" as they chat about their new plans to rob restaurants instead of banks and liquor stores. Eventually this scene will end the film as it doubles back on itself. Often times- and we're seeing the case more and more with Tarantino- he'll drive a film on dialogue instead of plot and substitute plot for senseless dialogue. That happens here, but it works most of the time. Lately it hasn't been working on the level of ""Pulp Fiction."" Uma Thurman plays Marcellus Wallace's (Ving Rhames) wife, Mia, and her only importance to film is to be entertained by Vincent Vega (John Travolta) on a date that's not quite a date. I feel as if these scenes are supposed to entertain us since it has nothing to do with the plot that is extremely thin compared to its run time (154 minutes). Travolta, for me, is the real stand out. When he's on screen his scenes, whether Jackson is next to him or not, are full of energy and pulp. He does a lot of listening, some dancing, a lot of arguing and/or debating, and offers up a lot of great comedic moments. His best scenes are with Uma Thurman when they go to Jackrabbit Slims. This little date, where they talk about nothing of much importance as far plot is concerned, is funny, engrossing and entertaining. I don't know why it never gets old, but it doesn't. The acting between the two is great and both were worthy of their Oscar nominations for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actress respectively. This section of the film is one of the strongest of the three along with ""The Bonnie Situation."" The writing and acting is superb in both sections. This date leads to an overdose as Mia takes a line of Vincent's heroine. The direction here is much in the mold of a graphic Hitchcock film. To add to the suspense the owner of the house counts to three (Something that happens quite a bit in the film). As he slowly counts to three we see all the nervously waiting faces in the entire room. We get a close-up shot on the needle that's cocked back and ready to strike. We get a close-up on the red dot where the needle needs to hit. It slowly builds the scene and the suspense. Tarantino handles this scene and all the others with a ton of precision and a lot of confidence. Tarantino makes huge strides as a director since his previous film, ""Reservoir Dogs,"" and a lot has to do with his confidence as a director. The older Tarantino is too confident in his abilities. The majority of ""Pulp Fiction"" has a lot of energy and snap to it. If you watch closely to the opening scene in ""Reservoir Dogs"" you won't see that same kind of crisp, confident direction from Tarantino. There are a lot of pauses throughout that conversation and it doesn't quite flow like a Tarantino film that we've become used to. To his credit he was working with some B-list (Some C or D-list) actors. He's not working with much more here, but the majority of his major role players are all acted out terrifically with the exception of one: Bruce Willis- through not fault of Tarantino; Bruce is just a bad actor. The section of the film that really drags, and is noticeably behind compared to the other two sections, is ""The Gold Watch"" section. This section is incapable of greatness since Bruce Willis single handedly ruins it with his ""Die Hard"" facial expressions, especially when they're not needed. The writing here is also the worst and, at times, puts the actors in very difficult situations. This section becomes annoying as we hear Bruce Willis call his girlfriend- that we won't care at all about- Lemon Pie, Sugar Pie, and retard. When he calls her a retard it's pretty funny, but other than that this lacks the punch that Travolta and Thurman provided minutes earlier. This section is bloated with dialogue, bad acting, and uninteresting characters. ""The Gold Watch"" has its moments and definitely picks up when we meet the gimp and the crazy world that we fall into. It just takes too long getting there. Christopher Walken provides a very interesting and hilarious story of the watch that has been passed down anally from generation to generation of the Coolidge family. ""The Bonnie Situation"" may very well be the strongest section of the film. This is where we meet ""The Wolf"" (Harvey Keitel) as he cleans up a mess made by Vincent Vega in a hilarious scene where he accidentally ""shot Marvin the face."" ""The Bonnie Situation"" offers up quite a bit of laughs, some great acting, and a very strong ending. The film ends where it started with Jules (Jackson) talking about changing his life around as he ""walks the earth."" Thankfully Gods interventionist-like hand, that saved him hours earlier, doesn't make him walk too far as He has sent him a weak person for the transitional Jules to save. The film ends on Jules changing or turning against everything he has ever done or known. Instead of being a bad - and killing ""Pumpkin"" (Tim Roth), he gives him some money, out of his own wallet, for a chance to start fresh and redeem himself. This might actually be ""Pumpkin"" and ""Honey Bunny's"" last heist, and they have Jules to thank for the chance at redemption and changing their ways.",9.0,DaveDiggler,2008/08/16,48,23

1677,The Chorus,By the numbers,"A middle-aged musician, Clement Mathieu (Gerard Jugnot), arrives at a boarding school for delinquent boys, Fond de l'Etang (Rock Bottom), with fear about his ability to handle the job of teacher and supervisor. His fears become even more real when he meets the overbearing headmaster Rachin (Francois Berleand), a man who takes out his frustrations by dolling out excessive punishments to the children. This is the premise of The Chorus (Les Choristes), a skillfully acted but by-the-numbers effort that fails to deliver any real emotional substance. Mathieu discovers that some of the boys can sing very well, especially troublemaker Pierre Morhange (Jean-Baptiste Maunier) whose boy soprano voice has a purity that is almost angelic. The teacher pursues a relationship with Pierre's mother Violette (Marie Bunel) and encourages her to visit the school more often, but she falls in love with an engineer without considering Mathieu as a potential father for her son. The teacher molds the delinquent boys into a heavenly choir (without a great deal of trial and error) and develops a positive relationship with most of them that demonstrates the redemptive power of music and further frustrates the surly headmaster. Although I did find The Chorus entertaining and truly enjoyed some gorgeous music, most of the characters are well-worn stereotypes and the film does not explore any possibilities beyond its tried and true formula.",5.0,howard.schumann,2006/01/09,15,6

1679,The Green Mile,""" I knows you think I's a powerful man, but the darkness scares me boss ""","The world is teeming with wretched prisons wherein all manner of men are housed. Because these men are said to have committed a crime, the places are manifest and most men serving there, have earned their stay. However, as history has shown, there are innocent men incarcerated as well. Occasionally, one of these innocents are not only imprisoned, but are further remembered because their life becomes legend. In this case, the realization is nothing short of incredible as the new prisoner is a natural empath. Steven King the prolific American horror writer, chronicles this unusual story in a Louisanna prison where one Joe Coffee, (Michael Clarke Duncan) a huge, nay, enormous Black man, having been convicted of murder, is sentenced to be executed, by electrocution. Tom Hanks( And Dabbs Greer) plays Paul Edgecomb, an aging Prison Guard, who recalls his years in the state prison. Working on 'Death Row' or "" The Green Mile "", Mr. Edgecomb recalls Mr. Coffee's arrival and the strange events during his stay. With sympathetic Guards, like Brutus Howell (David Morse), Dean Stanton (Barry Pepper), Harry Terwilliger (Jeffery Demunn and one particular sadistic guard called Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchison), Edgecomb recollects his discovery of the man's unusual healing powers and the surprising revelations concerning his innocence. The story is crafted by Steven King and it's application to the silver screen is perhaps one of the finest adaptation ever done. Duncan is magnificent and has a superb ability to allow the audience to learn his true purpose. Were it not for the sadistic behavior of Hutchison, who earned his ultimate reward, the story would not have carried it's genuine sympathetic awe which gave this movie it's Classic status.

1680,Primal Fear,"Despite making garbage like Pretty Woman and Runaway Bride, Richard Gere redeems himself!","I have long disliked Richard Gere since he's made so many bad films and yet remained a first-tier star. PRETTY WOMAN, RUNAWAY BRIDE, American GIGOLO, FIRST KNIGHT and KING David are all wretched movies despite the large numbers of the public who went to see these films. Just because people see a film does not mean the film is worth seeing or that the public is right. If you believe in the public and its collective intelligence, then perhaps you can explain WWI and WWII! So, people are, at times, quite stupid and Richard Gere is one of many actors who are inexplicably popular. BUT, despite my long rant above, I was actually very shocked that I found a well-written and intelligent film starring Gere!! But, given my jaded view of the public, this was of course, not one of Gere's more successful films to date! Gere plays a sleazy defense attorney that takes the case of Edward Norton who is accused of a violent and senseless murder. What I loved was that Gere really didn't care at first if Norton had done it or that he posed a huge threat to the public. Instead, he saw this case as a great way to get publicity. And, after a while, he starts to believe that maybe his client actually WAS innocent! Instead of going into the movie in more detail (since this will ruin any suspense), I want to talk about Edward Norton in the film. His performance was brilliant and chilling.

1684,Moon,"Sam Rockwell is the Entire Film, Which is Really the Biggest Plus.","Is Moon, the first film by Duncan Jones, David Bowie's son, recalling 2001, or does its excavating station on the far side of the moon just happen to date back to the 2001 epoch, which was indeed eight years ago? I'm prone to the second theory. After the mission carrying Dave Bowman vanished beyond Jupiter, the human race decided to concentrate on the moon, where we were already, you will remember, directing activities. In Moon, the inside architecture of the new lunar station was inspired by the 2001 ship, and the station itself is supervised by Gerty, more of a companionable version of HAL 9000 that elusively bolts around. One can't peg the story's period, but this station on the far side is geared by a single crew member, Sam Bell, played by Sam Rockwell. He is the entire film, which is really the biggest plus. As an actor with such pure and natural presence, he has been criminally underused, and now we are trapped with him all alone with absolutely no one else around, and he must carry the film all by himself, much to our delight. He's working out the final days of a three-year contract and is near breakdown from isolation. Talking to loved ones via video link doesn't do the trick. The predominantly computer-programmed station traverses lunar rock to extract Helium-3, processed to supply Earth with pollution-free power. I want to take a step back and consider some latent issues in the film. In an era when our space and distance barriers are being pushed way outside the human comfort zone, how do we cope with the trials of space in real time? In reduced gravity, how do our bodies handle the diminishing of bone and muscle mass? How do our minds deal with such seemingly infinite cycles of seclusion? The 2001 ship dealt with the corporal trials of its centrifuge. Dave and Frank had each other and HAL. Sam is all on his own, save for Gerty, whose voice by Kevin Spacey proposes he was programmed by the same voice synthesizers used for HAL. Gerty seems sound and affable, but you never know with these cybernated things. All Sam knows is that he's past his best before date, and about to be reprocessed back to Earth. Space is a bleak and desolate hole without mercy or care. Sam has no reliefs at all. Who would enlist for this assignment? What kind of a corporation would ask him to?

1685,The Green Mile,Frank Darabont's Green Mile goes the extra mile and delivers a great movie.,"I promise you that if you have any humanity in your soul, by the end of watching this movie. You will find yourself weeping, because how moving this movie is. The Green Mile is an amazing movie directed by Frank Darabont who knows a little bit about directing prison movies. His biggest claim to fame was 1994's Shawshank Redemption, a prison movie adapted from a Stephen King novel. So it was no surprise that Frank and Stephen King would once again team up to bring audiences another great movie. Can lightning strike in the same place twice? Yes! Set in the Deep South rather than the north this time, Green Mile takes place in Louisiana's prison during the Great Depression. The film really captured the era. Tom Hanks plays Paul Edgecombe, a prison guard that works at a quarter of the prison whom job is to execute the inmates. The job is hard and tough. He became to question himself, and his job when a new inmate came named John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), a simple minded giant whom works more like a miracle worker than a murderer. I have to say what a great cast! Michael Clarke Duncan as John Coffey was amazing. The way he can pull the audience in, with his delivery is just spell bounding. I got his 'broken glasses' and 'he kill them with they love' speech. I think this encompasses a major theme, how people are ugly and cruel to each other, and justice is only sometimes given. Everything about him, speaks John Coffey from the way he handle miracles, and even the child like innocents when playing with a pet mouse name Mr. Jingles. David Morse as Brutus ""Brutal"" Howell is a great supporting character that helps Paul with his job. I really liked his performance as the strong- will, second in command officer. Then there is Dough Hutchison as Percy Whetmore - he plays a great weasel. He captured Percy's cowardice, arrogance, and violence perfectly as the crudest of the guards. Last, worth noting is Sam Rockwell. He was a little older than how I imagined the criminal Wild Bill to be. He did bring some good humor to the film. I do find the moon pie scene hilarious. A lot of critics have panned the film for not having realistic characters. The characterizations on the death row inmates don't really seems like they belong there. Honestly, does anybody think Eduard Delacroix (Michael Jeter) even commit a crime? He seems way too old to be really a murderer, even Arlan Bitterbuck (Graham Greene) didn't seem so bad. Then you got Percy, the immature sadistic, racist, creep, painted here as being nothing less than 100% evil. Not 50% evil, not 80% evil. But 100% evil. Is that realistic? Is it? Does this guy have even a single redeeming feature? Nope, not one. So I'm not buying this guy either. The characters were way too good or just plan evil with little to no character development. I think it's OK to have film like that, and how the characters were portrayed, I think it was very accurate to the book. In the book, I had a hard time telling the other guards Harry (Jeffery DeMunn) and Dean (Barry Pepper) apart, so I'm glad in the movie, Dean was considerably older than Harry. The biggest change from the book is the racism in the South. I honestly think they toned it down in the movie, the n-word is used plenty of times in the book. Another thing that the movie didn't put was the short story about old Paul in Georgia Pines with a cruel employee that reminded him of Percy. Adding this to the movie would have made it too long, it was already three hours, but it definitely gave his elderly age some more depth. The movie did add some new things to help the film. I think the repeated visual of the light bulbs bursting during Coffey's bursts of power added to the story since we couldn't get inside of Paul's head. I also thought Coffey showing Paul what he saw as opposed to Paul going to investigate was a good move for the film - it shortened the film that was needed badly. Another thing that angry some critics, was the ""Christ"" like symbolism with John Coffey. People says it was too much messianic overtones in the story but it's absolutely ludicrous. As a Christian man, I wasn't offended by it. People need to be open to all beliefs to get this film. Once you get pass that, you find John Coffey to be a very interesting lovable guy, and you get emotional invested in him to the point that you cry when you see what happen in the end with his character. Then there are those people that mad because the movie is way too long. Not that that is always bad, but it didn't help things at all here. If this movie had been the standard flick, but I will defend this movie because the Green Mile is supposed to seem too long. It was even quote in the film. Anybody who read the book, should have known that. The music by Thomas Newman is amazing. It fits in with the mood of the film. Even the song from 1935's Top Hat work in this film. Overall: I really enjoyed this movie. I can understand why it was nominated for a Best Picture at the Academy Awards. An amazing story. Sad emotional for sure, but a lot of great stories are. BTW- RIP Michael Clarke Duncan. You were a great actor.",9.0,ironhorse_iv,2013/08/05,6,4
1686,The Wailing,The title says it all,"Yes, the title does say it all...endless wailing, wailing & more wailing! Like many posters on here, I also read the mostly positive reviews & had high hopes for The Wailing but I really didn't like it. I thought the acting was very poor (including the child. I honestly do not see why so many people thought she was a good actor, all she did was scream, wail, cry & wail some more...& I don't think she did any of those particularly well.) The main character was a terrible actor. I thought it was hilarious how inept & pathetic all the cops were. Someone is attacking one of their friends, what do they do? Basically nothing, of course, except wail, fall down & run away. I didn't like any of the characters, not a one. I guess most of all, I wasn't even remotely scared at any time in this movie. In my mind, the #1 reason for watching a horror movie is to be scared. Based on that alone, I give this a 2. I would've given it a 1 but I did like the cinematography.

1688,Blackfish,Disturbing ...,"This film tells the story orca whales in captivity at SeaWorld. There many interviews with former SeaWorld trainers, and footage from SeaWorld shows and training sessions including some whale attacks on humans. The documentary is well made – maybe not spectacular, but concise, well-edited, and balanced considering the subject matter. I don't doubt that the filmmakers have a particular point of view, but I wouldn't call the film biased or narrow in scope. Even though the interviews reflect general agreement, there is still lot of variety due to different personalities and experiences. The film is filled with anecdotes and detailed information about operations at SeaWorld, with some material about SeaWorld's predecessor ""Sealand"" and a few other places. All the interviewees are articulate and believable. The interviews and footage relating to the capture of whales - though not a major part of the film - are particularly interesting. I'm sure this film will be labeled one-sided by some. There is no editorializing in the film - all the opinions expressed are those of the people being interviewed. The filmmakers state that SeaWorld repeatedly refused to be interviewed, and I believe them. Experts seem to agree that orca whales don't do well in captivity. It seems a lose-lose situation for the filmmakers - either be accused of bias or be accused of diminishing opposing viewpoints by presenting individuals who are unqualified or ridiculous. I don't think SeaWorld is the devil. Many human activities are harmful to animals. But I think this film is the truth. I believe it shows SeaWorld for what it is – a somewhat unholy place, and just wrong. Everyone considering a trip to SeaWorld should watch this film first. Maybe it will convince you to try a whale watch instead.",8.0,SteveJ_888,2014/02/27,5,4

This is a film about the horrors that these animals go through being kept in captivity for our pleasure and the latest film to showcase how horrible Sea World can be for the very animals it claims to protect, oh the irony. If you thought watching 'The Cove' was difficult, I suggest you take tissues if you plan on seeing this. 2 days later and I still can't stop thinking about this movie or get rid of some of the images and sounds shown. I highly recommend this doc. Go see it with an open mind, I guarantee that you will never see captivity the same way again.

1690,The Chorus,Too sentimental even for a movie about a boys' school,"To Sir, With Love would look like stark British realism if placed next to this French treacle. All the clichés are in place: the troubled but decent boys; the overworked and cynical teachers; the harsh, almost sadistic, school administrator; the idealistic new staff member who wants to make a difference. You know the rest. The plot is not very carefully worked out and the whole enterprise has a slap-dash quality. Some subplots are begun and then just allowed to trail off. The acting is adequate throughout and the boys choir is nice to listen to, even as you doubt that a school of ordinary boys could possibly sound like that. This movie has gotten quite a bit of attention. It doesn't deserve any of it.",6.0,buff-29,2005/02/05,18,6
1691,Goodfellas,May Fold Under Questioning,"""Goodfellas"" is championed as a ""gangster movie"", but like most of Scorsese's pictures it's also a religious movie concerned about the destructive aspects of devotion. The film begins with one of its few moments of authenticity – a nightmarish sequence in which several gangsters knife a man to death in the trunk of their car - before zooming into the starry eyes of Henry Hill, a low level gangster who begins the film's narration with a heartfelt, ""As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster."" But Henry's recollections are not meant to be trusted. He's so obsessed with ""gangsters"" that his romantic view of crime eventually becomes akin to Scorsese's own faith in both cinema and Catholicism. We watch as Hill devotes himself to the hoods above him, a criminal clergyman who worships at the altar of the Mafia's glamorous lifestyle. As a kid, he gazes longingly at the neighbourhood gangsters as if they were gods. To Hill, being a gangster is better than being the President. Being a low level mafia ""somebody"" is better than being a regular ""nobody schnook"". Of course, the irony is that Hill's Irish ancestry prevents him from ever climbing the Mafia ranks. He rises from alter boy to priest but is unable to climb any higher, stuck in the very ""blue collar"" life he deplores. Released by Warner Brothers in 1990, ""Goodfellas"" follows the same ""rise and fall"" narrative progression as all the early Warner Brother ""machine gun operas"" of the 1920s and 30s. Films like ""Little Caesar"", ""The Public Enemy"" and ""Scarface"" all presented fairly simple critiques of crime, their first halves containing ""heroes"" who climb the ranks of the criminal underworld, crime aestheticized through the power of celluloid, whilst their second halves showed the ""hero's"" world collapsing inexorably around him. The message: crime is seductive but ultimately doesn't pay. Scorsese disguises his simple narrative with a frenzied style that might be described as ""anecdotal"" or ""documentarian"", but it's the same tale. We, like Hill, are seduced by crime, by the sheer sexiness of Scorsese's technique, before being subjected to a long 30-minute tonguelashing in which Hill's life comes crashing down. During this sequence, Scorsese revokes every technique he employed during the film's first two acts. Consider the way Scorsese shows us Hill's cocaine fuelled dash through the daily minutia of his life, the director's once lyrical long takes and smooth tunes now choppy, unsettling and paranoid. The point: Henry's life is a dream, a complete fabrication, the audience suckered into accepting the image-lie. Henry articulates this himself when he says he was ""living in a fantasy"", we the audience finally learning that our perception of mafia life is built upon artifice. Such a postmodern stance - ""Goodfellas"" is about the falsity of itself - is in many ways deeply pessimistic. The message isn't that ""crime isn't seductive"" so much as its ""crime is seductive only because it has never been truthfully rendered"". The film ends with the image of a gangster firing his gun directly at the audience. This is a homage to ""The Great Train Robbery's"" final scene, which 90 years ago caused audiences to flinch in their seats with terror. Scorsese's choice of referencing this shot neatly encapsulates how cinema audiences are still captivated by the charisma and violence of the criminal. But the scene also has the unintentional effect of showing how impotent the gangster has become. Devoid of new ideas, the gangster genre requires escalating levels of violence, camera pyrotechnics and swearing to hook audiences. Simply pointing a gun no longer has an effect. In ""Projections 1"", director John Boorman criticises ""Goodfellas"", writing: ""Marty's camera caresses them, celebrates them, dances attendance on them like the most sycophantic fan. This sets up an uneasy tension in the audience. When a movie is as well made as this, we are seduced. Our moral judgement collapses."" But seduction is the very point. This is not a film about gangsters, this is a film about gangster films. It is a film about the seductiveness of technique. A TV series like ""The Sopranos"" would take this further, presenting gangsters who are so seduced by false images of themselves that they consciously act like the image. What this leads to is a continual distancing effect. We move further away from the ""truth"" of crime, instead getting increasingly hyper-mediated levels of ""fake"". What's problematic is that ""Goodfellas"" - which feigns sophistication by being upfront and ironic about its fakeness - always gets touted as a factual and authentic account of crime, when its actually got more in common with something like ""Pulp Fiction"", in that both films are relatively substanceless joyrides with a surfeit of style. More interesting are the film's ""religious aspects"". Henry renounces his ideals and is promptly excommunicated from the mafia for heresy. For his sacrilege, the life he once worshipped so devoutly is taken away. The worship and devotion to something, the constant testing of one's faith and the inevitable disgrace that occurs when one cannot possibly live by an imposed morality any longer, are themes that permeate all of Scorsese's films. Harvey Keitel's ""faith in his brother"" in Mean Streets - a faith that is tested and then shattered - is very much the genesis of all these ideas. 7.9/10 – ""Goodfellas"" abounds with contradictions. It probes the fraudulent cinematic image of mob glitz whilst relying (""Funny like a clown? I'm here to amuse you?"") on the very traits it undermines. But really, the film represents the inability of the maverick directors of the 70s to push cinema any further; most simply sought comfort in nostalgia. Luckily today's new wave of modernist crime films (led by ""The Wire"") make an effort to map our increasingly complex world, which is why they are so murky and labyrinthine, compared to, say, the easily resolved conflicts of ""The Departed"".",,tieman64,2009/11/06,18,9

In the present days, the place is the Hotel Transylvania, where monsters bring their families to spend vacation far from the frightening humans. Dracula invites his friends – Frankenstein and his wife Eunice; Wayne and Wanda, the werewolves; Griffin, the invisible man; Murray, the mummy; the Bigfoot, among others – to celebrate the 118th birthday of Mavis. When the party is ready to start, the 21-year-old Jonathan is walking through the forest and stumbles at the hotel. Dracula sees Jonathan and disguises him as a monster to hide Jonathan from his guests. But Mavis also sees Jonathan and Dracula forces him to pose of a monster. Soon Mavis believes that Jonathan is the ""zing"" of her life despite the advices of her father about the humans. ""Hotel Transylvania"" is a delightful animation and a wonderful family entertaining for adults and children. The plot has a great message against prejudice and racism and the funny story made me laugh a lot with the gags.

1697,Interstellar,One of the most ludicrous films ever made,"Truly one of the most ludicrous films ever made. Virtually every moment of the film comprises a series of linked premises without any one of them having a rational basis. The film depends upon multiple concepts regarding space-time and space travel, most of which the audience is sufficiently familiar with to appreciate the potential story .... BUT ... each one of those is then formulated and entered into the storyline in a way that you cannot suspend belief. The series of presumptions just accumulate one ludicrous outcome after another, just in time to be posted straight into another ludicrous presumption. So what builds is a stack of preposterous situations that can really only be ""resolved"" by yet another, even more ludicrous outcome. This causes the late stages of the film to become so disjointed that the basic premise collapses. Note that the suspension of belief is, of course, fundamental to many films - in Star Trek for example, one suspends belief in accepting that faster than light travel is possible - or falling asleep inside your own dreams is believable, as in Inception - and that's AOK because the rest of the action is consistent. However, the number of presumptions you have swallow in Interstellar, that have no basis in science fiction or reality, strains credulity way past breaking point. One at least has to see a consistency for a film to be acceptable. Notwithstanding these comments, the individual elements are each highly watchable and Nolan does his usual blinding (literally in couple of the shots) best. The environments and space scenes are quite breathtaking. However, watching the film is a cascaded cataclysm of ideas, concepts, half-theories, impossibilities, broken linkages and downright wrongness, that appears on the screen like confetti in a gale. The disappointment is that the cast of actors is sensational, and they do everything they can to make the film a coherent ""reality"" .... but the outcome it to make them look like patsies to a conspiracy ... Possibly the only saving grace is the final 38 seconds - where the original one-line film-pitch made to the money-boys gets played-out ... but it's probably too little, too late",1.0,tom-seddon-14-855281,2014/11/09,258,117
1698,Interstellar,Confused and shaky in delivering the message,"In the opening night, I walked out from the movie theater, totally disappointed to see one of my favorite directors has diminished himself to such a low lever of performance. Poorly developing plot, immature explanation of astrophysics, unbelievable and unrelated events and characters, especial effects leveled to a Disney comedy, and horrible music are only parts of my negative impression. Even Mathew McConaghey did not seem believable looking at her daughter, older than himself. Mat Damon probably did his career's worst acting. The robot was another annoying part. What did Anne Hathaway and two other guys add to the story? Using a laptop to bring down a drown and control an inter-galaxy spaceship??? Finding a livable planet after passing through the worm hole, in ""another galaxy"" seemed easier than finding an ATM machine in a US interstate highway. Why would a director hire a ""Black-Hole-World-Expert"" as an executive producer to explain a worm hole function by drawing a line on a paper and punch it with a pencil? Just reading the worm hole article in Wikipedia would give you much more sophisticated knowledge. Mr. Nolan looked completely confused in delivering a solid message: Awareness of climate changes, saving human species, teaching relativity theory to common movie goers, or the power of love.

1699,The Wailing,"Underwhelming story and conclusion, genre mish-mash, some good cinematic moments","I'll provide the dissenting opinion here. (Spoilers follow, because I'm not sure how to articulate my dissatisfaction without talking about the story.) I was a big fan of The Chaser, and went in with high expectations. At the end of this experience, I'm left with many unanswered questions, and not the good kind. Not philosophical questions, not questions about symbolism. Instead, my questions are why we spent so darn long following threads that were ultimately little more than red herrings. Why the first third of the film was just burning time pretending to be a comedy and withholding the main plot? Why did the events in the film happen at all? What was the point of this entire exercise? This is a whodunit with a dissatisfying who, because we don't have a WHY beyond 'crap happens, evil exists, deal with it.' There is also a lot of genre confusion, and while other reviewers have labeled this a positive things, to me it just felt like a bunch of stuff tagged on for the sake of being tagged. Is this a possession/exorcism film? A zombie movie? A conspiracy thriller? A murder mystery? A comedy? It pulls from so many of the tropes that at the end of it I feel like I spent more time trying to figure out what film I was watching that just being able to watch the film. So, a bunch of negative feedback so far, but you'll note I still gave the film a 5/10. Lots of great cinematic moments in here. The locations, design and cinematography are mostly very satisfying. There is one sequence in particular (the major exorcism) that was incredibly compelling. And despite my hate for all the comedy at the beginning of the film being part of the genre noise, it was funny and enjoyable. Also some great performances, in particular from the child actor. Anyway, if you wanted to watch this film because you were a fan of The Chaser, go right ahead, just temper your expectations. It doesn't have The Chaser's palpable sense of dread and power. This is not a particularly frightening, emotionally moving or satisfying film, but it's got some good moments that make the experience not a complete waste.",5.0,antiraza,2016/05/31,194,111

This film is a story about love, life, relationships, crime, and it has its own hilarious brand of Euro-humor.

1703,Moon,Bad science ruins this movie,"Bad science ruins this film. First off, the clones. Unless clones and the supporting technology are ridiculously cheap, why would it be more cost-effective to keep an army of clones in reserve rather than put more people on the moon to take care of the base and each other? Previous hard SF treatments of industrial work in outer space always depended on the eccentricities of people to find those who were willing to work in extreme environments for long periods of time. Robert Heinlen was famous for his ""space hardhat"" individuals like ""The Green Hills of Earth""'s Rhysling and the construction workers in ""Delilah and the Space Riggers."" J. T. McIntosh's ""Hallucination Orbit"" even goes so far as to put men in orbit around Pluto for up to seven years, figuring they'd do it for the money even knowing the dangers of such isolation. This screenplay treats humans as so vulnerable that a three-year stint only light-seconds from Earth is beyond their capacity, and so expendable that the corporation is willing to kill someone every three years rather than spend the money to replace them via ship or just have a few more people around. If the technology exists to fuse He-3 and create clones with implanted memories, why wouldn't it be a simple matter to just replace a crew every few months? What about the original Sam Bell? Why would he be willing to let copies of himself be killed every three years? Rather than a study of what makes a human being, this is more a representation of what happens when human life becomes cheap. Do the clones have no rights? Does Earth even know about this process? Apparently not, given the voice-overs at the end of the movie, which makes one wonder why the corporation is wasting this technology to produce throwaway superintendents rather than getting rich in the medical line. At only one point did the movie engage my emotions, and that was when clone-Sam-1 had the conversation with ""his"" teenage daughter and realized that his whole life had just been stolen from him. Maybe if the script had dealt with a few of these side issues, and then focused on how people would truly behave to discover that their lives were a fraud and of no worth, then perhaps we would have had a great film. Instead, we are left with a superficial treatment that might have made a good 30 minute ""Twilight Zone"" episode.",4.0,EndlessBob,2010/10/19,82,39
1704,Moon,The Clone Bores,"I rented this movie based on the IMDb rating of 8. Wow! I'm in disbelief. I'd give it a rating of 0.05 if I could. Any comparison between this film and the seminal masterpiece ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is as absurd as comparing a high school football game to the Super Bowl. This is one of the absolutely worst films I have ever seen. The plot is so haphazard, dull and convoluted I still don't understand the story line. What I was able to piece together is a pretty implausible scenario for conducting mining operations on the Moon. The dialog – what there is of it -- is unbelievable and ridiculous. The story drags and drags and drags because Sam Rockwell only has one other character to play against – a clone of himself. His character is hapless, clueless, and idiosyncratic. He reminds me a little of the neurotic isolated astronaut Bruce Dern played in the 1972 ""Silent Running."" Oh, there's also his computer sidekick that's yet another clunky imitation of ""2001's"" legendary HAL 9000 computer. But this computer is a crying bore too. Kevin Spacey tries to sound like a flat unemotional computer, and his voice is so over-equalized that he sounds like he's talking from inside a toilet stall. Unlike the devilish scheming HAL, this is a nauseatingly altruistic computer that displays – believe it or not – sappy emotioncons. It's so submissive it offers to have its memory wiped. You half-expect it to ask you out for a beer at the bar, or to give you a back rub. By the time the film ends you are lost is space, or at least went through a space warp where 97 minutes stretched to what seems like three hours of tedium.

1705,Detachment,Amazing and rare movie gem,"As there are countless movies dealing with this ""concept"", this one really stands out. Throughout the duration of this movie, I felt more and more compassion and understanding. The way Brody portraits this ""broken"", ""barely holding on"", ""yet strong"" character is beyond my comprehension. Once again he proves to be an amazing actor, that makes you feel things as you watch him. The way they gave the character a profound depth is what makes this movie so great. You can have a great actor and a lousy script, but in my humble opinion this movie has it all. Although I found some of the sidetracks to be a bit ""too much"" it all contributed to the ""nakedness"" of the movie. And the ""supporting"" cast is well picked. William Petersen has, although it being a real small roll, the facial expressions needed to believe him. Lucy Liu does it so gracefully and Marcia Gray Harden seals the deal with an amazing performance.This subject must not be kept in the shadows. These kinds of movies should be out there and they should be making people ""feel"". In short I loved the movie, it gave me a sense of sadness but also hope....that there might still be people out there willing to fight for what they believe in. Respect those who are willing to invest in you and your future!",10.0,willekens_i,2013/05/31,5,4
1706,The Chorus,Education,"~Google Translate~ The famous ""Three Character Classics"" in China writes: People's initial nature is good. The same is true of these children in the film. These children are called ""problem teenagers"" in China, but this does not mean that they are hopeless. However, in the same way, educational methods are also very important - fighting can not solve problems, mainly how to let children know that they are good for society.",10.0,sunxiaoxiong,2019/10/28,0,0
1707,Pulp Fiction,"Pointless, immature and excessively crude glorified action film from the world's most pointless, immature and excessively crude man!","Simply put Pulp Fiction is the silliest film I have every seen, it puts Battlefield Earth and The Long Kiss Goodnight (spookily starring the two leads from this film) firmly in the shadows, they look like rare vintage wines next to this cheap plonk. The fact it is so highly revered by so many, and even considered profound, makes me fear for the very existence of modern society. There are some fundamental reasons I dislike this film with a passion, the first being the pacing and substance, the film really mirrors it's director to perfection, yapping and a mumblin and a stumblin from start to finish, enthusiastically about....Nothing! If Qentin was not such an untalented, cretinous buffoon I would call him the new David Lynch. The only substance in PF is of the white powdery verity, the film is just a collection of sick images splashed on screen willy nilly strung loosely together by some sharp but pointless dialogue. The film was too crude, made purely for shock value. When violence, male rape, drug abuse, accidental shootings and other such fun filled things are packaged as cool and even as comedy in the hands of an immature director you get a highly irresponsible film, and to sell it as some sort of 'smart art' piece is doubly irresponsible. Then there is the complete lack of character development and depth. There are no characters, only 2 dimensional machines created solely to perform acts of severe violence and drop in a few wise cracks, they perform actions in one scene that seem to have no effect or relation to what happens in their next scene. Not one of them is even slightly likable or in possession of any redeemable characteristics apart from perhaps Butch (Willis), did I mention he is a violent thug, murderer and a thief? Then there is Mia who seems to have little purpose in the film other than an excuse to include the very uncomfortable scene where an over weight Travolta boogies on the dance floor. Yes she is in the 'famous' needle scene as well, but what else? The section featuring Vince and Mia was just dropped and barely mentioned again like Mia herself, so what was the point? A question I asked of the film throughout. I quickly realised that nobody in the film was there to be developed, any one of them could have been dropped (apart from Butch) or their actions performed by a completely new character without making a spot of difference to the film, their actions were not to be the subject of scrutiny. That would be asking too much of the Tarantino who is clearly only interested in attempting to make stuff look cool. He is the most unoriginal man on the planet only capable of tacky 'homage' (ie, he is a thief) action films. Don't believe me? Watch Kill Bill where he even pays homage to his own film, this one! I do give credit to him in one respect. He realised that if he re-jigged the order of plot events he could not only look artistically swish but he could disguise the fact that the story is not worth the toilet paper it was written on, impressing upon many the fallacy that the hack job narrative structure enhanced the story. The direction is experimental but quite frankly tacky and laughable at times. One scene featuring a near comatose Butch in particular comes to mind, the camera is stuck dead still on him while Marsellus (Rhames) uses the m-f word 100 times in about 5 minutes, totally amateurish. The only memorable performance is from Jackson, who could make the ingredients list of a packet of cookies sound fun, he is offset by a flat performance from Travolta. That brings me to the 'witty' dialogue which, apart from the violence, is the crux of the piece. It is unfortunate then, that this dialogue basically consists of idiots talking a load of nonsense about such deep things as cheeseburgers, milkshake, foot massages, cleaning up skull and brain chunks and some coffee that is described as gourmet s**t. Some dialogue was witty but mostly it was just utterly pointless, the characters deliver it with such perceived style and coolness despite the fact they were talking about, frankly, a lot of BS. Add this to the fact there is (barring brief moments in Butch's story) no plot, no emotion and especially no substance and you have one worthless film. ""Ah you don't get it"" they all scream, don't make me laugh, the circular narrative and the ham-fisted attempt at redemption at the end does not equal substance. The ending was hilariously cheap, obviously a desperate attempt to justify a pointless 2 hour string of images in one strike. Is it meant to be profound? Well after sitting through the whole film which consisted of characters that were never developed adequately, where no actions or events were properly tackled, challenged or explored with any great thought or depth during which I was never required to care even once, I was presented with one of the most cheesy, pointless monologues in film history. Oh and a parody of QT's fans - the briefcase is opened and they stare at the shiny thing and go ""ooooh, it beautiful"". It is all a hollow gesture when you consider the character that delivers the speech and his actions directly following it, combined with the entire sequence of stupid events that precede it. Many movies these days suffer similar problems at their conclusion because of obvious limitations in plot structure and development, some have endings that invalidate the rest of the film, others have endings that are invalidated by the rest of the film, with Pulp Fiction QT has somehow achieved both simultaneously. You'll figure out what I mean. As a rule I don't usually let a film's director put me off the film itself but, after Kill Bill and Pulp Fiction, Tarantino films are now the exception.",1.0,Mighty_sheman,2005/06/07,274,110
1708,Blackfish,Blackfish,"Blackfish is an eye-opening and brutally honest documentary of all the hidden truths behind Sea World and keeping whales in captivity. It will take all of those butterfly worthy nostalgic memories of going to Sea World as a kid and getting playfully splashed with water by the giant whales, and essentially beat them down until your stomach is churning. Blackfish is an intense and emotional film that I would compare to witnessing a car crash. You don't want to look, but you have too. It is an animal lovers worst nightmare due to its graphic content, and the deep sorrow you will feel for all the whales who are being physically and emotionally abused throughout the film. It is an extremely captivating documentary, and everyone should know of the dark realities behind the process of holding a wild animal captive. Throughout the film you will have a large number of facts spit at you, all of which are extremely insightful. You will see life displayed, as well as tragic death. All of which will turn your perspective on Sea World, and the whole theory of holding a wild animal captive, upside down. As a child I hopped in the car and impatiently waited to arrive at Sea World and go get splashed by the whales that seemed larger than life. After watching this documentary, it made me wonder how healthy and happy these seemingly spirited animals actually were, and what was actually going on behind the scenes. There are very few things more heart wrenching than having a piece of your childhood brought into light as essentially a lie, and this film is sure to break your heart. I approached the film nearly clueless towards what to expect, and I found myself absolutely furious about half way through. I don't know if I was furious at Sea World, or furious at my own ignorance, but I knew I was completely overwhelmed with emotion. You see sheer guilt and shame displayed from human beings who have taken part in capturing whales or working with them, and it is just raw emotion. That is something that is very appealing about the film. They hold nothing back, and you see such a widespread view of human perspective, and I think that is something that as humans, we kind of crave. A film should make us feel something, or make us go deep in thought about something, and that is why this documentary is so brilliant. The general theme throughout the film is just that we should be more aware of our surroundings. Sea world is completely exposed in this film, and for so long, we were all under the impression that everything they did was harmless and playful. It is really a film that just appeals to anyone who is in the dark. The purpose of the film was very apparent, and inevitably successful. All in all, as heartbreaking as Blackfish is, this documentary is necessary. With media and technology increasingly becoming more and more important in our society, there are a growing number of ways to make a difference. This documentary uses film to bring to light a problem that has been completely covered up by dancing whales and Shamu merchandise, and what a brilliant move that was. We are caught up in a time period where we are all adapting to find what works, and how we can get people to care about more than the latest iphone update and what sports team is playing that week. Blackfish chose to break everyone's heart for an hour and twenty three minutes to make us care about this problem, and it has made all the difference in the industry and the mind of people. I would encourage everyone to take the time to watch this film, because we shouldn't be in the dark forever. This film is important, and even though emotions might invade you, you won't be able to turn it off.",9.0,cbcp,2015/10/18,3,3
1709,October Sky,Heart Pounding and Insperational,"I had no idea how much this movie(and the books alone) would do so much for me. I've also loved the space exploration projects, and rockets, and stars, and everything that goes along with the Universe and our Solar System. One day, when my grandpa rented this movie, I knew it was something I had to see. I was 12 years old(now I'm 14. Almost 15) I sat there on the carpet, barely blinking at every scene. Of coarse the stunning good looks of Jake Gyllenhaal(playing as Homer Hickam Jr.) caught my eye, but the story outline was terrific. Amazing. Perfect. Well, not perfect. Mr. Johnson could've made it like the actual Memoir the whole way through instead of 70% true.... After I finished watching the movie, I knew I had to meet Homer Hickam Jr. someday, somehow, some way. I rushed to the computer, went to the Internet search bar at the top of AOL, and asked my grandpa on how to spell Hickam. I got a hold of Mr. Hickams official website...... One year later. The day is October 26th, '00. The day of my life I will forever remember. I had finished reading over ""Rocket Boys(aka October Sky)"" and Mr. Hickam was coming out with a new, ""equal"" Memoir. ""The Coalwood Way."" I WAS GOING TO MEET HOMER HICKAM!! My insperation. My mentor. My favorite author. When I met him at his book signing, got my books sign, my life felt complete....until another year later.... I GOT TO MEET HIM AGAIN! His newest Memoir ""Sky of Stone"" Had just come out this past October. I was going to meet him again. Have him sign a book, well actually books, this time...again. I had just bought Back to the Moon, and hadn't got a chance to finish it. I got my picture taken with him. Mr. Hickam is truely a God_given-gifted, talented man. He's my hero.

1710,The Green Mile,One of the most penetrating films,"It's not everyday that a movie is able to change an audiences opinion on something. ""The Green Mile"" is a movie that made me think long and hard about supporting the death penalty. The film, based on a novel by Stephen King, contains such a variety of emotional events that it repels its audience away from its subject rather than glamorizing it. Only a handful of recent productions have been capable of such power. ""The Green Mile"" is truly one of the best films this year and is Oscar Worthy in many categories. It is a unique, three hour experience that must be seen to believe. ""The Green Mile"" contains so many vivid performances, I will not be able to honor everyone who deserves credit in my review. Michael Jeter, Gary Sinise, Doug Hutchison, James Cromwell, Bonnie Hunt, and David Morse are all superior in strength of their characters. Each contributes Oscar worthy performances, and if the Academy leaves these individuals out at Award time, they need to recheck their databases. Michael Clarke Duncan recently received a Golden Globe nomination for his supporting role, and he deserves it. Tom Hanks is just unspeakably brilliant in the leading role. He is right behind Kevin Spacey from ""American Beauty"" in the best performance of 1999.",9.0,Tucker_Keon,2008/08/18,3,2
1711,Pulp Fiction,"Ah, so by that rationale, if a pig had a better personality, he would cease to be a filthy animal. Is that true?","It kind of feels redundant trying to write a review for Pulp Fiction as it approaches its 20th birthday. As a film it needs no introduction, it won the Palme d'Or at Cannes, won a BAFTA and Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay (Tarantino), and garnered a whole host of other awards and nominations. Box office beef was meaty and its reputation even now shows no sign of waning (it currently sits at number 4 on the IMDb top 100 list), it is by definition one cool MOFO of a movie, a picture loved by a cross section of demographics. But why? Pulp Fiction oozes humour, romance, violence and stylish flourishes. It remains compulsive viewing throughout; even as it threatens to get submerged in its own complex structure. Film lover Tarantino takes a number of low life and unfortunate characters from Los Angeles, mainlines then with movie clichés, and then amazingly breathes new life into them. It knowingly winks at B movies from the past yet always remains fresh on its own terms. I myself having just revisited the film after a 5 year gap can attest to just how well it holds up, laughing at the dialogue, perched on the edge of the seat as violence starts to rumble, and yes, singing along with that most catchy of soundtracks. Yet for all its flashiness and hipster chattering, there's one thing that often gets overlooked when talk of Pulp Fiction's greatness arises. That of a basic human urge to survive or find salvation, Tarantino's main characters may be bottom feeders or scummy operatives of the underworld, but there's love and needing beating slowly in its dark heart before the drugs and violence take a hold. Neat trick that from Tarantino, brilliant in fact. 10/10",10.0,hitchcockthelegend,2012/02/13,59,34

I know that is hard topic, but let's face it,when a film about cancer is in the billboards everybody thinks is a excellent movie when the big C is present in the synopsis. Hollywood had banalized and trivialized the topic, there is a movie almost every year about it, that the people just adore 'em. The industry must look for other ways to show to the common people how hard is the whole topic; The avant- garde films about the topic are not as recognized as they would be (La guerre est dÃ©clarÃ©Ã©, or maybe even 50/50 that took the whole drama of the illness with a grown-up patient). It's well done movie, and the end is fresh (yeah, I like the end) but it's still a Hollywood movie made for the teenagers (specially females, really SPECIALLY) who wants to see how love works and then dream about it until they're 30 and they are still singles.",7.0,btw_912,2014/06/06,11,5

Yet, because he is so average, any one who as ever experienced hardship can connect with him; Arthur Miller's character, via Dustin Hoffman, is able to reach anybody. Arthur Miller's original screenplay is a work of art in its self, however, Hoffman gives a spectacular performance. And, with John Malkovich's fine supporting performance, the movie becomes, truly, powerful. The movie has a very definitive ending, but it leaves the watcher with a question to reflect upon: Did this man with the dream really have the right dream after all.",8.0,gallagher-dylan,2007/11/28,1,1
1715,Crash,Overrated in Every Sense of the Word,"*Very Minor Spoilers, but who cares because YOU DO NOT WANT TO SEE THIS FILM* I purchased this DVD because it had won the Academy Award for best picture. Directly after viewing it, I crushed the DVD into tiny little pieces and disposed of it because the film is absolute garbage. It should be re-named to ""Racial Clichés that Have Been Depicted in Films Millions of Times."" I felt compelled to come to IMDb and give it a one star rating because there is no way that this movie should be in rated in the top 250. Let me just say this: RACISM IS NOT A NEW IDEA. People are lauding ""Crash"" as if it is some sort of god-sent piece of artwork that is going to suddenly open the world's eyes to racial tensions. All this movie does is compile a ton of characters that are lame racial stereotypes whom we've seen millions of times over. Even worse, there are so many characters masquerading as racial stereotypes that the movie completely fails to perform an in-depth examination of ANY OF THEM. Each of the characters gets maybe 10 minutes of screen time and that is it. For example: You get the bigot white cop, you watch him be racist, you see that he has a soft side, he ends up saving a black woman, END OF STORY. I have no idea how this movie won an Academy Award for Best Picture for it is a poorly executed hodgepodge of stereotypes that goes absolutely nowhere.",1.0,GOBandSteveHolt,2007/09/29,95,55
1716,Goodfellas,Rightfully hailed as one of the greatest gangster epics of all time,"STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits A film (one I'm sure you're all familiar with) charting the rise of Henry Hill, a young man growing up in a neighbourhood in 1950s New Jersey, who is in awe of the wise guys who lurk in his neighbourhood and the respect and power they command. With low prospects and an abusive father, Henry can see no other way to go than to become one of them and we follow him on his journey as he becomes ingratiated in them, the crimes he carries out for them, his marriage that starts well before going disasterously off the rails, a spell in jail after a job gone wrong and finally where he goes wildly off the rails when he starts taking/dealing drugs and him finally ending up having to testify against his former friends when he becomes a liability to them and they put out a contract on his head, which is still in force today. Robert De Niro. Ray Liotta. Joe Pesci. Three men with faces you wouldn't want to mess with and all perfectly cast in the leading roles in Martin Scorsese's legendary crime epic. All men are on fine form but, in ironically the lesser role, special mention to Pesci who steals the show as the wildly psychotic Tommy. Scorsese's masterpiece was one of the first films to really make use of the camera in new ways, from the long, lingering shot to the still shot, used excellently at various points in the movie. These are usually complimented by a fine 50s soundtrack playing over them, with some real lingering melodies from that era. The story works on two levels, both enlighteningly as an expose of how the gangster world and the gangsters themselves actually have very similar philosophies and worries as normal 9-5 people (with regards to families and staying on top of the competition) as well as showing just why the attraction to that life is so great (hitting home most forcefully at the end when Henry is forced to acknowledge that he'll have to lead the rest of his life like a 'shnuck!') and also engagingly as we watch a man rise from nothing to great heights only to lose it all again through his own bad choices and misguided loyalties. Indeed, as the film spans four decades, we do leave the film feeling as though we've known these characters for years. Coppola's The Godfather will remain the most accomplished crime epic of all time, but Scorsese's effort can never be scoffed at and will rightly remain one of the most well remembered films of it's sort, if you've got the stomach to sit through it in certain parts. *****",10.0,davideo-2,2006/02/12,71,38

The underlying message is what's most important when watching this film, and it has to do with the theory of why we as humans are so emotionally detached and messed up. It all starts with our childhood and the impact our parents or guardian and environment has on us. The director did an outstanding job relaying that message. I can understand why Adrian Brody won an Oscar for best actor some years ago because he was really great in this and there's just something so moving about the way he can express emotions through his eyes.

1720,Taxi Driver,Unrelenting descent into one man's private hell.,"One of the most talked about films of all time is Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver, it has been pored over, analyzed, and dissected to within an inch of its life it would seem. Taxi Driver is something of a bad dream, it's like we are privy to the melt down of the man next door because Travis Bickle has a certain level of believability, and it's this fact that makes Taxi Driver such a riveting and skin crawling delight. We see New York from the confines of Travis's Taxi Cab, the grim and grime of a dead beat society is itching away at the viewer because of the claustrophobic nature of the viewpoint, we see thru Travis's eyes, his shifty tortured eyes. This grim urban play gains maximum impact from Bernard Herrmann's score, one moment we are listening to a jangly pornographic sounding jazz/blues fusion and then we get Travis accompanied by judder music, unstable judder music! Michael Chapman's cinematography is appropriate to the feel of the film, some how it feels off kilter to further emphasise the unease unfolding on the screen. The supporting cast are as impressive as they are memorable, Jodie Foster lays down a marker that she thankfully continued to improve upon, Cybil Shepherd gets to look pretty and convince as the intrigued but cold Betsy, whilst Harvey Keitel manages to get away with sleazy pimp portrayal by enthusing the character with menace without the histrionics. It's Robert DeNiro's show all the way tho, everything that has been said and written is true, he has the viewer firmly in his hand, from the portrayal of the uncomfortable loner at the start, right to the mohawk wearing crusader at the end, he scares and enthrals in equal measure. He is Travis, and no greater compliment I can pay his performance than to say that I feel I'm along for the ride with Travis, he has my undivided attention, always!

'Horrible Bosses 2' gets it right, as there are hardly any major minuses here. Sure, the second-hour, where our ill-fated protagonists plan to execute their plan, could've been shorter, with a better climax. But otherwise, this sequel is a riot. The sequences, one after the other, especially the ones with Horrible Bosses Veterans (Portrayed superbly by Kevin Spacey, Jamie Foxx & Jennifer Aniston), bring the house down!

Editing is good. Performance-Wise: Jason Bateman, one of the finest actors in the block, delivers a truly committed performance, yet again! Charlie Day is first-rate, he contributes to some of the film's funniest bits enormously. Jason Sudeikis supports very well. Christoph Waltz deserved more scope, nonetheless, he's passable.

All I know is that my hard-earned money was sucked into this monstrosity along with me and for that I am truly regretful. Like a few other commenters, I had absolutely no feelings or connection with any of the characters, even hoping at times that they would all fail in their meaningless endeavors. A ridiculous premise with outlandish and unscientific bases, very little of this movie makes any sense at all. It amazes me that Nolan was able to draw the acting talent to this waste of time, as their considerable skills are completely wasted on this drivel.

1723,The Green Mile,Overlong and too worthy but still a good story  just don't expect it to be anything like Shawshank 2!,"Now a resident in a rest home, one time head warden on death row, Paul Edgecomb, is struggling with his untold memories. When a film brings it all back to him he recounts the story of the time when a huge black prisoner called John Coffey was put into wing. It is not too long before the peaceful, loving prisoner, found guilty of the rape and murder of two children, has mysterious gifts that transcend the decay of the lives around the prison. After Shawskank Redemption I was attracted to this as many of the makers were the same not to mention the author, the prison setting and the running time. However that same running time and some negative reviews put me off and I didn't get round to seeing it till recently. The film is very slow and this is occasionally to it's detriment but not too often. It's main failing is that it's supernatural spin makes it difficult to get involved and lose yourself in completely. `Redemption's ` strength was that it was a human story. Green Mile tries to have the strength of human spirit at it's core but it doesn't quite come off. That's not to say that the story still isn't moving and involving because it is. However it doesn't come as easily as it should and when the story slows a little bit it does feel slow. It could easily have lost 30 minutes as at it's current length it feels like a long movie which is a bad thing  Two Towers is long but didn't FEEL long! Also something I always find annoying is when a score really works the emotion where the actual film can't manage it by itself  here the score is working overtime to wring every drop of emotion from the scenes. The film is very well directed and there are powerful moments of cruelty. When the chair is used I couldn't help but feel that it was real. However the main attraction (other than the mouse!) is a wonderful performance by Duncan. True there is an element of slave cliché about it but he rises above that a gives a performance of such emotion and such gentleness that came as a surprise from someone of his build. Hanks is also good and wisely plays it quite low-key and the support cast is solid, comprised of many many well known faces including Morse and Cromwell. Overall this is good but overlong. It is a very different film from Shawshank and many will compare it to that much better film. However the film is worth the work despite some simplistic errors and flaws.",,bob the moo,2003/03/08,36,14

It's the inspiring story of two young people who are no different then all of us, as they both are in the process of dieing. Though Hazel Grace and Augustus are more aware of this fact of life; because their eternity"" has an expiration date, set by Hazels terminal illness: Cancer. As the viewer is put on an emotional roller-coaster, alongside the feelings and attitudes towards life and love the two teens share, this movie will be a key to many locked doors in the recepients minds. And through these doors we are lead by an ensemble of actors who are amazingly sensitive in their portrayal of personalities and emotions. The writing and directing is so brilliantly executed, that you have sympathy with every character this movie so caringly brings to (short) life.

1726,Crash,"Disappointing, derivative, and manipulative.","***SPOILERS*** One of the worst 'Best Picture' winners in years, and that's saying something. If you want to see a good movie about race, watch 'Do the Right Thing' again (Or if you want something in LA, try 'Falling Down' or 'Colors'). This lame and manipulative set of vignettes is a watered down version of LA long-cast-list films 'Short Cuts', 'Grand Canyon', 'Traffic' or 'magnolia' - take your pick, they're all ripped off here - in support of a not-too-profound thesis: ""You can't judge a book by it's cover"". Not exactly the most thought-provoking take on race relations. Each character is introduced in a situation staged to create one type of perception, and then later contrived circumstances show us that our first impressions were wrong. That's the whole movie, one easy cinematic trick... rinse and repeat. What shocked me most was the many storytelling continuity errors. A cop stumbles across a car-jacking in progress and one of the would-be jackers flees. The jacker is later seen hitch-hiking his way home and is picked up by... the same cop, now off-duty. The car that was getting jacked was being driven by a man presumably going to see his wife, who had earlier been involved in a near-fatal car accident. But his wife's well-being is put on hold while he asserts his rights to the cops who pulled him over, dresses down the other car-jacker after giving him his gun back, and stops to watch a car (that, coincidentally! the cop who pulled him over set fire to after killing the other car jacker... you know, later, when he was off duty) burning. While watching the flames engulf the car, he calls his wife to tell her that she loves him. That's nice honey, are you coming home any time soon? I kind of had a bad day, pinned under a flipped, burning car and all. Did anyone even consider hiring a script editor on this film? It's hard to fault the actors, most of them are quite good. It's easy to imagine a good film in here somewhere, but what wound up on screen is just a sloppy mess which alternates between tragedy and sugar-coated sentiment. Time will not be kind to 'Crash' either - this is NO classic. Unlike, say, Cronenberg's 'Crash'... now THAT was a thought-provoking movie.",3.0,scicala,2006/03/18,42,26
1727,October Sky,Rocket Boy's Life Soars,"I resisted seeing this movie and I understand why it was not a big hit in theatres. ""October Sky"" feels and looks oh so familiar. And it is. All plot contrivances and emotions have been explored before in other films -- and possibly even better. But despite it's familiarity and resistance to all formulas Hollywood, this movie is winning and likeable at every turn. Sputnik is the inspiration for this journey of the heart, mind and soul. Just as the characters from Steven Sondheim's musical MERRILY WE ROLL ALONG stood agape atop their apartment roof hoping it would launch their new generation (""What do you call it? You call it a miracle.""), Sputnik has a similar affect on the young rocket boys of this true tale. While jaded townsfolk of their 1950's coal town dismiss the event, Homer Hickham sees Sputnik as his ticket out of a life in the mines. Masterful direction and casting make the journey of rocket boy Homer and his pals seem fresh and new. Especially affecting are subplots concerning Homer's ailing young school teacher. Remarkable restraint is shown in depicting their delicate relationship. Also remarkable is the father / son supblot that anchors the film. Perfectly played all around. Even Homer's mom gets her moment without cliche or intrusion. Her ultimatum to her husband is both dignified and heatbreaking. ""Myrtle Beach"" says it all. A major video chain I despise has a sign next to this film stating that you'll love this film or they'll refund your money. For once, I agree with them. You'll never look at the October sky quite the same again.",8.0,NJMoon,1999/08/22,62,49

1730,Ferris Bueller's Day Off,"Awful people, awful story, awful message","Ferris Bueller's Day Off would be a strong contender for my least favourite film of all-time. I have no idea how this movie became so popular and garnered such a cult following. Breakfast Club was bad enough but John Hughes went one step further with this drivel. The character Ferris is one of the most unpalatable central characters I have ever seen in a movie. This guy is an over-confident brat who lives in a mansion with loving parents while receiving a first-rate education yet decides to actively rebel against his so-called oppression. And John Hughes thinks we are going to relate to him somehow? Not only that, he looks like a spoiled rich kid. Matthew Broderick has one of those incredibly smarmy faces that you just want to slap. He also looks 25 years old despite being baby-faced and its very difficult to take him seriously as a schoolkid. It is highly fitting that the final scene of the movie is Ferris smiling at the camera with an unspeakably smug expression on his face. Also, how exactly does Ed Rooney, the school principal, become the bad guy? Is caring about your students' attendance some kind of character flaw? This kind of writing makes the kids look like spoilt brats, not trendy rebels. And as for Cameron, another overgrown man-child, are we really supposed to like this guy as well? A rich kid living in paradise who is happy to smash up his daddy's $100k Ferrari just to iron out some personal insecurities? Does Hughes think this is commendable in some way? Would there be any actual consequences to Cameron's actions like a beating from his Dad or being kicked out of his house? Almost certainly not. These are the most low-risk rebels ever created. The carnival scene where Ferris mimes to Twist and Shout is one of the most excruciatingly cringe-worthy things I have ever seen. This is just pure self-indulgence from John Hughes, who I am pretty sure only makes films to coddle his own warped fantasies about what it would have been like to be the cool kid at high school. The only real positive in this movie is the soundtrack which, like most eighties films, is great. Jennifer Grey is also quite good I suppose, at least in contrast to Broderick and Ruck. Aside from that though, this is just complete trash. Not funny, not meaningful and actually quite offensive.",1.0,MGPT80,2020/04/14,11,6
1731,Detachment,Wow... My first review & it couldn't have been a better movie..,"At first I was a bit skeptical about watching this as it is a drama and I am not a big fan of drama movies. The only reason I watched this was because it starred Adrien Brody and I loved his performance in the Pianist and boy it was worth every second of my time. I was glued to my seat from the beginning till the end because of the idea, which makes Detachment so special. The animations during the movie just captures your mind and has been done fantastically. Its been a while since I have seen a film with such a well written realistic plot and beautiful execution. The movie involves you in it from second 1, though there is not much of a story as one would expect, but again this movie is about reality at its finest. The characters were strong and though the movie was a bit slow, it made its point and point well made I would say. Its a must watch if you like movies which are thought provoking and which actually make sense.",8.0,kevinabraham393,2012/05/14,12,11
1732,Ferris Bueller's Day Off,"This movie did, and does, speak volumes to me","Having grown up about 20 miles from where Ferris was supposed to live, and having been in high school when Ferris Bueller's Day Off came out, I was set up to get a lot out of this comedy. I always put this movie on when I need to remember that life is supposed to be about having fun, and the best fun usually comes at times when you should be getting serious (like Ferris's college prospects). It is a pure comedy, and that is what makes it so PERFECT. Alongside movies like Rebecca and Miller's Crossing, I give Ferris a 10/10. Also, Ferris's portrayal of Chicago is brilliant, like that of Blues Brothers. I especially love the montage at the Art Institute. If you want to know what makes Chicago great, those two movies can tell you most of the story.",10.0,trimbo,1999/06/01,1,1

1734,The Chorus,Gerard Jugnot is extraordinary as a failed musician who arrives at a boarding school and transforms the rebel children,"This is a marvelous ode to classic music , to childhood plenty of innocence , friendship , cooperation , curiosity and comradeship . Being inspired by the film La Cage Aux Rossignols (1945). It revolves around the widely successful orchestra conductor Pierre Morhange (Jacques Perrin) , who reminisces about his childhood inspirations when he and his former classmate Pépinot (Didier Flamand) read the diary of their old music teacher Clément Mathieu (Gérard Jugnot , thanks to this box-office film he earned the title of the highest-paid French player in 2004, overtaking Jean Reno , Jean Dujardin , Vincent Perez and Gérard Depardieu). Set in 1948, in the post-war season at rural ¨Fond De L'Etang Internat¨ , there arrives a watcher as well as professor of music , Clement Mathieu , as he becomes the supervisor at a boarding school for the rehabilitation for minors . What he discovers disconcerts him , as the current situation is repressive with a stiff-upper-lip Principal (Francois Berland) who ruthlessly punishes some rebel kiddies . This troubled ragbag of lop-sided children is unwittingly awaiting an empathetic patron who believes in transformation through the conductor's baton rather than the cane executed by the headmaster . As Clement becomes into an enlightened Samaritan pedagogue with hopes for their hearts . While , a young Morhange is the badly behaved son of single mother Violette (Marie Bunel) and Clement brightens up the school and assembles a choir , leading to the discovery of Morhange's musical and physical talents and a transformation in the children . Through the power of song , Clement tries to turn the students . And Clement's ditzy fancy for one boy's mother stretches the plot . French cinema has a great ability in dealing with films about childhood , with interesting and thought-provoking messages that are a clear example of an allegory of notorious values , such as friendship , honor , philanthropy , collaboration and mistreating denounce . This is an splendid ode to childhood , a nostalgic trip to the past in which we become children along half and hour , where everything was discovered , in which the songs and chorus were serious things . Sincere in its sentimentality , it is cutely optimist that believes in the redemption as metaphor of the golden heart . It's a kid's movie but its strength lies in its universal character , not a story just for kids , it's for everyone . This entertaining film displays a colorful as well as evocative cinematography as well as a wonderful musical score . Boarding school movies hit a peak with ¨Jean Vigo's Zero De Conduite¨, ¨Lindsay Anderson's If¨ and ¨Truffaut's 400's blows¨ , but this French box office takes its enjoyable inspiration from a different tradition , the motivational piety , goodness and mirth of ¨Goodbye Mr Chips¨ and its wake . Awesome acting by Gerard Jugnot -also co-producer- as a decorous , self-minded chorus conductor , not instantly set for the unabashed hostility his students show him . Support cast is frankly magnificent with the acting more self-contained than the constantly swelling soundtrack , as the following actors shine : Kad Merad , Jacques Perrin , Francois Berland , Didier Flamand , and the child angel face Jean-Baptiste Maunier who was the soloist of Petits Chanteurs de Saint-Marc , and other actual boys choir soloists . Principal photography by Jean-Jacques Bouhon , Dominique Gentil , Carlo Varini took place on location at the Château De Ravel in Puy-De-Dôme . Using foam and salt as artificial snow and green leaves were removed from the grounds , since the beginning of the movie was filmed in the summer, but set in the Winter . As it was filmed in the middle of summer which was hard for the actors to wear winter clothes . A model of the boarding school featured in the film at a miniature railway museum in Châtillon-sur-Chalaronne and fog machines were also used around the castle . It features a sensitive soundtrack , which was composed by Bruno Coulais and performed by the Bulgarian Symphony Orchestra , conducted by Deyan Pavlov and the choir Les Petits Chanteurs De Saint-Marc , as the producers chose to hire real boys choir soloist . It displays heartwarming , sentimental choral performances in general , the Chorus translates into a strong , albeit repetitive album. The motion picture was well directed by Christophe Barratier (L'outsider , París, París , War of the buttons) who gives an approach exquisite and original ; in fact , this was the #1 movie at the French box office , with more than 8.6 million admissions . It is a great portrait about unfortunate post-war orphans , appointed to children as well as adults .",7.0,ma-cortes,2017/08/23,3,3
1735,Intermission,enjoyable but not essential,"I saw ""Intermission"" in a small theater; the sound was bad which made the tricky Irish accents difficult to decipher at times. Still, the film was funny, interesting and involving enough to be enjoyable. The script was good and was it's pleasing that each of the numerous characters of this ensemble cast had resolution in their tales. The evolution of each of their stories was enjoyable, especially if you like character-driven stories. Cillian Murphy (John) was the brightest performance but not to be outdone by an aggressive and explosive Colm Meaney. Colin Ferrell was unimpressive aside from his nasty appearance and a couple golden moments, as in the opening scene. Shirley Henderson and Kelly MacDonald were decent too, but not overly impressive, which is acceptable given their straightforward roles. The film shines when the intersection of its characters make it evident how much action and reaction can affect others. --Cause and effect, trust and deception, love and hate, love and sex, sex and violence, violence and justice, justice and criminality: welcome to an exhibition of these dynamic polar forces weighing in on everyday life::: The characters are blasted apart, drawn together and into collision and this, surely, is always amusing to watch. Again, sound quality is imperative and was the film's major weakness. However, I had no problem paying the matinee price for a 90 minute romp in Ireland. 6/10, JCC",6.0,juancalzetta,2004/04/19,22,11
1736,Crash,As contrived as it is a classic,"'Crash' is about the tensions between various races in Los Angeles. Yes, hardly a topic for a light-hearted romp through the city. You'll probably have to be in the mood for something a lot darker (and at times poignant) which will make you think (just don't think too hard... but I'll get to that). The first thing you'll notice is the wide range of A-list actors on display here. Yes, it's one of those 'ensemble' casts and even those who don't have their own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame are definitely also 'recognisable faces' meaning that even those who don't have quite as much screen time as the major stars are all capable of turning in a strong performance. Sandra Bullock may be the 'biggest' star on the cast list, but, in my opinion, it's Matt Dillon who steals the show. What you get is a selection of random - some average, some more privileged - people in L.A. whose lives are all due to 'crash' into each other in one way or another. Yes, that's where the title comes from, but, just in case you miss this meaning, there are also at least a couple of literal car crashes in there as well! Personally, I loved the film. It shows good and bad people of many different races and gives you a bit of a 'whistle-stop' tour of what it's like to be them. You could be expecting one hell of an epic film with so many people on the cast list. Surprisingly, it's not overly-long and, although this is good that it never drags, many of the characters never really get 'fleshed out' as they probably could have done (had this be made today and given its own Netflix TV series, or something). I don't see that as a gripe, but those who didn't enjoy 'Crash' as much as me do tend to dwell on how it's all a little too contrived. They ask, 'Would all these life-changing events really happen in such a short space of time?' The answer: probably not. But who cares? Do we stop watching 'Eastenders' because too much happens in such a small area? It's a film. It's making a point - and quite a brave one. It shows that no one race is all good and always right, possessing the 'correct' way to live their lives. We all have flaws and we all have people of our own 'kind' who are good and bad. I remember it even won some awards when it was first released. I agreed with that decision, but I also recall people disagreeing. However, if you want to see something that is as dark and tragic as it is funny and poignant then definitely give 'Crash' a go.",9.0,bowmanblue,2019/12/25,4,4
1737,Ferris Bueller's Day Off,Take a day off and watch this gem,"John Hughes defiantly had his finger on the pulse of teen comedy when he made this gem. My favourite comedy of all time, it has everything you want to keep you entertained. It is about a boy bored with school who decides that he is determined to have one last day on the wag before he and his friends finish for good. Despite being totally over the top in many parts you will be able to relate to near enough everything that happens during the first half an hour. Tying to fool your parents by faking illness, The stroppy sister telling them that there's nothing wrong with you while your extra busy parents are in a rush! Best of all, which will strike a chord with everyone is the boring teacher who sends everyone to sleep as he rattles on in a monotone voice!!! Matthew Broderick is excellent in the role he was born for, while I wish they had girls in my school who were are gorgeous as Mia Sara, convincing as his girlfriend. Alan Ruck is brilliant as Ferris' extra nervous hypochondriac best friend Cameron while Jeffrey Jones is a hoot as Buellers Nemesis (The Headmaster at school) The gags speed along just as fast as the kids do in Cameron's dads Priceless Ferrari!!.

I understand that people love this movie and I don't want to take that away from anyone, you love the sh*t out of this movie, also I see plainly that I am in the minority, in regards to audience reaction to Ferris Bueller's Day Off. Recently, some one has published an article arguing that from a clinical observation, the actions of the character Ferris, would in real life be those of a psychopath.I feel a lot of validation from reading this article ( apologies to the article's author, I didn't bother to learn your name ) because it explains to me the impression of Ferris Bueller I had as a kid.

A basically tawdry and sleazy story about a tawdry and sleazy bunch of mobsters is turned into a garish comic strip that is never quite funny enough to overcome the truly revolting violence, which is portrayed in as hideous a manner as possible.

1741,The Chorus,Awesome movie!,"By getting nominated for Academy Awards in both the Foreign Language Film and Best Song categories, Les Choristes (The Chorus) made a rare (for a European film) double impression at the 2004 Oscars. This sentimental tale follows the arrival of a new teacher at a remote boys school in 1949 France (the war is a largely unspoken but ghostly presence). With disciplinary problems rampant, and the policies of the old-fashioned headmaster not helping, Monsieur Mathieu decides to introduce choral singing as a way to bridge the gap with his students. You don't need a crystal ball to figure out where this will go, although the movie uses its atmospheric location and lush vocal arrangements well. Bald, dumpy Gerard Jugnot provides a refreshingly offbeat hero (though securely in the traditions of the My Most Memorable Teacher movie); he's sort of a younger Philippe Noiret. Director Christophe Barratier works in the winsome-cute mode that makes a certain kind of French movie into an overly sweet Bone Bone, although at least this Bone Bone sings.",8.0,Gunnar_Runar_Ingibjargarson,2008/06/19,3,3
1742,Taxi Driver,One of my favorite Movies!,"Taxi Driver is a Neo-Noir crime drama, directed by Martin Scorsese. It is starring Robert de Niro and Jodie Foster and is about a mentally unstable taxi driver who feels a need for violent action and wants to help a young woman to escape from her bad situation. It takes place in late 70s New York when the city wasn't the nice clean city as we know it today but it was a city full of criminals and unemployment. Taxi Driver is a really interesting character study and although it's slow paced it doesn't feel boring. Although the first two acts are slow paced, the final act is very thrilling and brutal. The ending makes you keep guessing. The Soundtrack composed by Bernard Herrmann captures that feeling of 70s New York very well. It has very beautiful cinematography which is very dark and rainy the whole time which sets a great mood for the film. The best thing about this movie is by far Robert de Niro's performance. He does a very good job at portraying this mentally unstable veteran, who can't fit in the society anymore.

Cilian Murphy adds to his list of effective movies and Colm Meaney is pure genius as the rogue cop that takes himself a little too seriously.

1745,Interstellar,3 hours stolen,"Seriously? Some people are rating this 10? I'm no physicist but I do have a basic understanding of what is within the realms of possibility. Firstly, the first line of the synopsis of this film on IMDb. Scarcity of food on planet earth due to drought and famine? What? Sorry,but no. On our planet we are currently storing seeds in a massive archive from countries all over the world. Even North Korea. They're being stored underground and kept at a very low temperature. Also, we can grow vegetation without sunlight. There are many people doing this today. So why, if for any reason, would we be risking our crops to this unexplained environment? This is just the first problem I have with this film. At no point was it explained of what the cause of this global famine was. I want to know, and I waited for 3 hours for an explanation that never came. Secondly, forgoing the wormhole, if gravity is that strong to slow down time, you'd be crushed, and waves wouldn't even exist. Let alone 100 foot waves. Thirdly, the robot. Why oh why is it a box that seemingly can move over any terrain? Throughout the film the same joke. Humour level at 75%? Sarcasm rating at 80%? Oh yes these ""jokes"" came thick and fast. The only joke I could see is that this film was actually made and I wasted 3 hours of my life. If you want to watch a brilliant sci fi, with Matthew Maconaghy, watch Contact. It was made in 1997 and was written by the famous cosmologist, Carl Sagan. Now that's worthy of a 10. The only good point about Interstellar was the visuals married to the brilliant soundtrack.

1749,Crash,Take this film seriously? I don't think so!,"Well, my friends, I finally got up the gumption to see ""Crash"" this week so I could decide for myself. I really did want to believe that it had best picture quality. And putting it succinctly, it was a revelation. And the revelation was how to make a totally unbelievable set of circumstances such that it leaves the audience no opportunity to interpret anything at all. The film started about 7:50 and by 9 I was practically shouting at the screen, ""Are we supposed to be taking this seriously?"" GIVE ME A BREAK! Then when the scene where the Iranian man fired the gun at the locksmith, I just completely lost it. I told my partner very forcefully, ""I'm leaving."" He pleaded for me not to, that it was almost over. I repeated, ""I'm leaving,"" and I marched out of the theater, threw my leftover popcorn and soda into the garbage (where I believe the film should be thrown), sat down in the lobby and cried for five minutes with my face in my hands, I was SO upset. How any thinking person could have selected that piece of garbage for a Best Picture Oscar -- completely unbelievable situations, contrived and manipulative dialog, amateurish camera work not even good enough for an SVU episode, and the feeling that I had been repeatedly bashed over the head with hate by means of a sledgehammer? I don't have time for that kind of anti-artistic expression in the remaining years of my life. I might also point out that of the 70 some odd speaking roles in the film, there was not a single gay character portrayed. Talk about unrealistic for the city of Los Angeles! The only thing that could have improved the film would have been a top-flight director and not the writer. Let me compare ""Crash"" to the 2003 British film ""Love Actually,"" which also has multiple diverse plot lines coming together at the end. LA accomplished its purpose SO much better than did ""Crash,"" but I will be forever calling ""Crash"" by the name it truly deserves, ""Hate Actually."" I might add that this was only the 2nd time in my life that I have actually walked out of a movie because I was so upset. I absolutely refuse to be repeatedly hammered and be told constantly what I'm supposed to be feeling. I will not be manipulated. Be forewarned.",1.0,grinderny,2006/03/25,109,63

I figured that it had to be good, with such a high score. Makes sense, right? Man, was I surprised. The movie was awful. The majority of the actors weren't at all believable and those who were played annoying and cheesy clichés. Many scenes made no sense and were unrealistic. The whole experience was bad as well. The audience that went to see this film is made up of teenage girls who ignored all the faults in the film and gave it a 10. I hope someone like me is reading reviews here. Then maybe they could avoid ever paying to see this movie. I nearly left the theatre towards the end when pretty much everyone in there started sobbing uncontrollably.

1755,The Green Mile,One of the most penetrating films of the past several years. **** out of ****,"THE GREEN MILE (1999) **** Starring: Tom Hanks, David Morse, Michael Clarke Duncan, Bonnie Hunt, James Cromwell, Michael Jeter, Doug Hutchison, and Gary Sinise Written and directed by Frank Darabont. Running Time: 180 minutes. Rated R (for scenes of strong disturbing violence, language, and some sexuality) By Blake French: It's not everyday that a movie is able to change an audiences opinion on something. ""The Green Mile"" is a movie that made me think long and hard about supporting the death penalty. The film, based on a novel by Stephen King, contains such a variety of emotional events that it repels its audience away from its subject rather than glamorizing it. Only a handful of recent productions have been capable of such power. ""The Green Mile"" is truly one of the best films this year and is Oscar Worthy in many categories. It is a unique, three hour experience that must be seen to believe. The story is more of a personal narrative than an actual plot. The film offers an interesting perspective of the events that take place. It is seen through the eyes of a man who is over one hundred years of age, Paul Edgecomb, who is currently living in an old folks home with his friend, Elaine. During a very emotional day for Paul, he tells Elaine of a historical year in his experiences. She listens closely to his story. He tells of a particular year in the 1930's. The setting is a beautifully crafted prison hall. Paul explains he used to be a kind prison guard on death row in charge of overseeing the executions. In this year, several significant activities occurred in his life: he had a terribly painful urinary infection, and met a prisoner named John Coffey. This man has been sentenced to the electric chair for the rape and murder of two innocent little girls. This man isn't like anyone else Paul has seen, however. Aside from being massive in size, he is humble, mild mannered, and caring. After several miraculous events take place that may point to the thought that John Coffey might have magical powers from God, Paul begins to doubt the crimes this so called criminal has been convicted of. Throughout the story we witness three executions that in an electric chair. These capital punishment sequences have much power and significance. The electrocutions, one in particular, contain some of the most unsettling, disturbing material in film history. The movie is anti death penalty; we see the sometimes sadistic world from the prisoner guards point of view. It will put you in their shoes--and perhaps, change your opinion on the death penalty. I certainly had to think about my stand on this issue. I did have questions that were not really answered by the filmmakers. I wanted more on John Coffey's magical powers; the miracles aren't investigated enough to suit our pleas. I think the movie could have also stood on a firmer platform of religion. We assume that Coffey's abilities are a gift from God from the character's dialogue, but religion itself is more of a theme in the film than a message or plot point. I can perfectly see why the writers decided to leave these elements to the audiences imagination, to provoke participation. So I suppose my objections are not really flaws, just personal aspirations. ""The Green Mile"" contains so many vivid performances, I will not be able to honor everyone who deserves credit in my review. Michael Jeter, Gary Sinise, Doug Hutchison, James Cromwell, Bonnie Hunt, and David Morse are all superior in strength of their characters. Each contributes Oscar worthy performances, and if the Academy leaves these individuals out at Award time, they need to recheck their databases. Michael Clarke Duncan recently received a Golden Globe nomination for his supporting role, and he deserves it. Tom Hanks is just unspeakably brilliant in the leading role. He is right behind Kevin Spacey from ""American Beauty"" in the best performance of 1999. The message to ""The Green Mile"" is clear and understandable: justice isn't always just and the miracles can happen in the most unexpected of places. This film is one of the most penetrating dramas of the past several years. It will induce your mind to think about its subjects, and gradually build on you. ""The Green Mile"" is a movie that will stick with you long after the ending credits role by. Brought to you by Warner Bros.",10.0,Movie-12,2000/01/25,282,241
1756,Hotel Transylvania,"Decent film, but not hugely impressive","I had heard a lot about this one being good, so I decided to watch it but was rather underwhelmed. Most of all what kind of bothered me was the constant happy-cheery-jokey kind of stuff going on. I get that the target audience is young children, but I don't think that necessarily means you need to make everything so silly and cheesy. I've seen a lot of really great children's movies that were more serious (though still age-appropriate of course) and only had the occasional funny bit. Especially considering the monster theme, I did not expect this level of silly and cheesy. And while on the topic of the monster theme, that's another thing that kind of bugged me. Maybe I'm just stuck up, I don't know, but it bothers me when creators take too much of a creative liberty with established classical characters or beings/creatures, or in some cases they just got things wrong (like the oh so typical case of calling the monster Frankenstein when that's in fact the name of the man who made him, that's a massive pet peeve of mine, and just generally making his character entirely wrong). I suppose I just prefer more old- fashioned monsters. And... Why is Quasimodo not human, and more importantly, why is he some sort of crazy fiery chef??? Speaking of which, Disney's Hunchback of Notre Dame is a pretty good example of how a movie for children can still be pretty dark and serious without CONSTANT comic relief. Overall the movie is not awful or anything, not at all, but much too goofy, over-the-top, predictable to a ridiculous extent, and not very ""authentic"" with its monsters. I'd say it has too much of a modern tone as well, if that makes any sense. This could have been so much better if the creators had the courage to be more unique.",5.0,redanhemma,2017/10/12,1,1

We trust they offer our little ones the best that they have, to help them be the best they can be. It is easy to connect to the characters, as we can easily identify them with people who we have met in the past when growing up. The cinematic experience is unique, soundtrack is mind-blowing and rides along with the movie at a perfect pace.

1758,Hotel Transylvania,Sucking the blood out of animated movies?,"Not really. But not giving it new life either! Now that we have cleared the puns (you may come up with some of your own, if you like), let's get to the meat of things ... Alright almost cleared. But while I do have fun writing the review, I wish I had more fun watching the actual movie. Now I know this is meant to appeal to children (though there are a few scenes, that are borderline to say the least, if shown to the little ones), but that doesn't mean it has to be stupid. Pixar set a high standard of course, but other studios have followed and there have been quite a few entertaining fun animated movies. While this isn't DOA (or undead to stay with the theme), it clearly lacks heart. This pun was not planned, but it is in tune with the jokes of the movie. Most seem not planned and just ridiculous. Does that mean you won't have fun watching this? No, you might even have more fun with this than I had with ParaNorman (a far superior movie, though not perfect either). As the rating shows on IMDb, many loved the movie and I hope you do too. I'm just telling you to not raise the stake here ...",5.0,kosmasp,2013/05/09,5,4
1759,Taxi Driver,Still don't get it?,"Just forced myself to watch this film again for the third time thinking maybe I had some Natural Born Killer prejudice against this movie, which I kicked, but after painfully sitting through this thing again for the last time all I can say is I'm tired, depressed, and befuddled at the high praise for this darkly disturbing film. Or maybe that's the alure for some people. If you look at the votes for this thing people either love it or hate it. I'm mostly indifferent. The problem I have with Taxi Driver is that there are too many unanswered questions about Travis' background, experience in the Marine Corp, etc. We know he was discharged while Vietnam was winding down but we don't have a clue what the source of his ""instability"" is! Are we to assume that he had suffered some sort of trauma during the war...did he ever see any action...was he really discharged because of his instability? In fact, the guy seems perfectly normal other than a slightly obsessive compulsive complex which 70% of society is sporting, and he can't sleep. A[URL] poor thing. Well neither can I, and a lot of people can't sleep at nights. Does that alone make Travis a candidate for the nuthouse? Nope. The truth is, we don't know what his problems stem from and that is a major problem with this movie. His descent is so spontaneous when Betsy reacts about being dragged to an adult film, and he just snaps, we don't know why?!? (spoiler alert) Next thing you know the guy is buying guns like there's no tomorrow to feed his all-of-a-sudden John Wayne complex that springs from a source we can't as an audience connect with. Good performances overall don't salvage the many holes that litter the canvas of this highly overrated drama. And somebody please explain to me all this talk about Travis searching for ""redemption"", from WHAT>?>? Jeez!

1760,The Green Mile,"Wow, just wow.","Wow is all I can say. Let's see... I was only a mere nine years old when this movie came out in 1999. I had always known that ""The Green Mile"" was a good movie -- all I knew was that it featured a large black man and I can remember people talking about it. Now, at 21, I took the time to actually watch this movie last week and am completely blown away. A little late... maybe. But it just proves that this is a timeless piece of work that will continue to be viewed through the decades. I won't go over the plot because most other reviews have already done so. But first off, the acting. Incredible. Never did I for one second doubt these characters. And for once, every single cast member did a fantastic performance. I will admit that I have always been a Tom Hanks fan but he outdid himself in this movie. I think it's his best performance by far, beating out Philadelphia by a nose and Forrest Gump. Just a stellar job well done. *Spoiler* The scene in which John Coffey crabs Paul Edgecomb's hand, you can see and feel the pain right along with them. That has got to be one of my favorite scenes from any movie. The only actor that could have even done a better job than Hanks would be Michael Clarke Duncan. A better actor could not have been cast for that role. There is just something so magical about this film. Initially, seeing that it was over 3 hours, I thought it may be a bit long. It never felt like 3 hours and certainly every scene was necessary. After watching a modified television version tonight, I realized that EVERY single minute of that film was so important and none could be cut to get the full effect of the movie. I have watched this 4 times within the past 2 weeks and that says something right there. I am not a good movie reviewer but felt compelled to write one about this flick. It's just simply amazing, THIS is what movie making is about, and it's so rare to watch a film such as this. If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and buy the DVD!

1761,The Green Mile,Ensemble Performance,"Ensemble Performance (n): Wherein all elements of a stage play, film or other suchlike entertainment deliver together, all participants contributing equally as their characters allow, creating a singular and powerful presentation. The above is my own ""definition,"" if you will, but that's how I feel about The Green Mile. From Tom Hanks to Michael Clarke Duncan to David Morse to Doug Hutchenson in the major roles to elements as small as James Cromwell's warden or Gary Sinese's cameo, no one and I mean NO ONE ""phones it in,"" or merely goes through the motions. Also appreciated was the pace of the film. Some complain that three hours is too long. I submit that to allow the characters to unfold at the pace of the South in the 1930's, to get the depth and breadth of them, three hours was necessary. For myself, I started watching it of a Saturday evening, thinking I'd ""spot"" through it. The three hours flashed by. Frank Darabont creates the reality of a Louisiana prison in the 1930's, sets the stage with the characters of Paul Edgecomb, Brutus ""Brutal"" Howell, Eduard Delecroix, Arlen Bitterbuck and Percy Wetmore. Into this menage he weaves the magic of a simple black man, John Coffey (""like the drink, only not spelt the same""). The impact Coffey has on Paul Edgecomb, on Warden Moores's wife, on a mouse named Mr. Jingles, indeed on the entire Green Mile ... is a source of wonder in the story-telling that makes this period piece the marvel that it is. Also very worthy of mention is Thomas Newman's brilliant score, which brings blues and prisoners' chants and multiple flavors and nuances to the table, as much a part of the ensemble as the above-listed characters. Keep in mind, this is no action-packed, whiz-bang, shoot-em-up piece of eye-candy. It's a beautiful, detailed and subtle piece, not much like any other piece of Stephen King I know of other than ""The Shawshank Redemption"" (which I've yet to see, believe it or not!). And it's a piece I've repeatedly enjoyed for the quality of its production and the power of its performances. I recommend it heartily. Please enjoy.",10.0,Loren-3,2004/09/30,7,4
1762,Blackfish,Shocked,"I had heard about this documentary but was never really that interested until a friend of mine told me more about it.

Look I understand its very biased against them, but honestly at some point you have to look at the facts that were given in this film. I had no idea about the accidents of trainers that had happened in the past. One was very recent actually and I guess I should watch the news more. I can't believe that happened. What got me upset the most about it is that Sea World blamed the trainer for the accident. In fact, they seemed to blame the trainers for every single incident that's ever happened. I believe they said there were about 100 or so incidents with the whales and trainers. As a kid, I enjoyed going to Sea World. In Hawaii we have a Sea Life Park, and I loved going there. Little did I know that these whales were being treated terribly. Having something that big living in such small quarters is bad and no wonder sometimes they act out. Some of the clips that are shown are disturbing but they never show any deaths. I for one won't be attending Sea World ever again. In the end, a judge ruled that trainers aren't allowed to be in the water with the whales anymore, what did Sea World do...they appealed. Are you kidding me? A trainer just got eaten.

When my wife and I went to see it, soon after it came out, multiple people walked out of the theater saying either it was a terrible movie and/or it sickened them. Maybe all of us were just allergic to Tarantino's sick fascination with violence. The violence is just so gratuitous and casual as to make it seem like a bad video game. Outside of that, the overall movie has the feel of being viewed through the eyes of someone high on bad drugs. Please excuse my lack of specifics regarding the film, but I've fortunately blocked most of them from my memory.

1764,Death of a Salesman,A story with more morals than words,"Because of its complex nature, its many morals, its non-linear flashbacks, and its over-the-top characters, I express extreme doubts when believing that Arthur Miller's renowned Death of a Salesman was meant to be read. The iconic play has won several awards, was performed in the 1940's over seven-hundred times resulting in four revivals on Broadway, and has continued to be translated and performed in countries other than the United States, where it originated. For a play, the story of Willy Loman's dysfunctional family has had unprecedented success. As a film, it has had its share of setbacks. To my knowledge, never has a theatrical production of the film been made, which is depressing to note, seeing as directors like Roman Polanski have proved that they can transition a play to a screen-production with little to no constraints. What we were fortunate to get were not only several low-budget, TV renditions of the story Death of a Salesman, but we are grateful to get a telling of the story on film, written by the original author, Arthur Miller, made for the CBS network in September 1985. The story is kept the same, albeit some metaphorical and symbolical changes, as it revolves around Willy Loman, a naive, broken man who has failed at the game of life and business and has halted his family's growth because they are so committed to either boosting their leader's confidence or keeping him from sinking. Willy's long suffering wife is Linda, played by Kate Reid, a miserable, shell of a woman so determined to help her husband through uncertain times she's forgotten how to help and better herself. Their two sons are two equally broken men living at home well into their thirties. They are Biff (John Malkovich, a gifted actor, who gave a terrific performance as Lenny in another acclaimed novel, Of Mice in Men in 1992), a football star brought down by the weight of his failure of a father, and Happy (Stephen Lang), a cocky ladies man replicating who Willy the characteristics Willy once gleefully held; brashness, confidence, and the ability to strike a deal. The main problem with Willy is his naivety towards the business world and to himself; he continues to convince himself that the only thing necessary to succeed in business is a firm handshake and a high likability factor. By doing this, he convinces himself that by possessing those very important traits he can do anything, and yet he hasn't. He is roadblocked by not only that, but by his falsifying sense of optimism, telling himself and everyone around him that he is ""not a dime a dozen"" but Willy Loman, a unique individual. He is only more upset when he sees how his best friend Charley (Charles Durning) and brother Ben (Louis Zorich) have gone on to lead happy, successful lives with limitless wealth and opportunities, and he is confined to his cramped apartment, told to be himself which does nothing but let everyone down. Willy is portrayed by Dustin Hoffman, a character actor with a barrage of films under his belt. Hoffman's performance of Willy is definitely admirable, but it isn't as layered as one would hope. He is written efficiently as a character victim by his own delusions, but several times does Hoffman seem like he is teetering on the lines of self-parody rather than seriousness, almost the equivalent to a Woody Allen archetype. Nonetheless, he is completely capable in this role, and when he hits the right notes, specifically in Charlie's office and during Willy's final monologue with the family (more commonly known as his ""dime a dozen"" speech), he truly shows what power and strength he brings to the table. But perhaps the film can be known for not just taking a complex, theme-driven play and creating it into a very, very intriguing film, but also for bringing more style to a made-for-TV movie than anyone ever expected. The replication of the inherent seamy, humidity-soaked New York atmosphere is stunningly portrayed, with Willy Loman's listless agenda to only heighten the gloomy setting. The other aspect is the way the filmmakers constructed the environment. I've read that the set of Death of a Salesman is mainly composed of an old play setting, most likely from a version of the play, meaning several buildings don't have roofs, several backdrops are artificial, and several background buildings are one-dimensional cutouts designed to only give the look of the environment. This isn't as disconcerting as it sounds, but it livens the film to a new height, making it closer to the feeling of an actual play rather than abandoning the stage-feel to favor a more polished cinematic feel. Schlöndorff's directorial efforts to make Death of a Salesman a functioning film and playwright Arthur Miller taking his personal material into his own hands to give fans and newcomers the version he wants on screen have both worked wonderfully. This is a complex picture, doing different things for different people and showing each person a different theme or meaning. Whether it be a commentary on the business world, a tragic story of a once-successful businessman who was never ""once-successful,"" a picture showing an American's tragic existence, a failed American Dream, an insight into the tragic hero, or how one man can collectively bring down his entire family by his own delusional self, this is a gripping story made into a surprisingly efficient film with performances of impact and style to laud.

I love the jealous sister who really wants to be more like Ferris but just does not feel like she could and I adored Charlie Sheen but still..

I enjoyed this so much that I watched it over and over and then 9 years later I stumbled across it again, you don't realisze when your a teenager how important things are and how good some memories are, but once you get older you begin to appreciate life and realize how much fun you had watching this. All the characters play good roles in the movie, Matthew Broderick really does a good job as the lead role Ferris.

The principal of the school,is a detestable man who abuses students and teachers equally. You've seen the plot before, of course, and some of the characters are ""stock"" sorts. But the acting of the lead, the teacher who ""saves"" the students by luring them into singing, is portrayed charmingly by Gerard Jugnot. Mostly bald, a bit stocky and no beauty, he is nonetheless disarming. The boy soprano, Jean-Baptiste Maunier, has a wonderful voice, and the chorus is splendid. Particularly fine was the score, almost entirely original, by Bruno Colais. I was looking for something inspiring on this bitter cold inaugural day in the U.S. Les Choristes made my spirit soar and reaffirmed that kindness, generosity of self and the gift of music still have the power to change people's lives.",9.0,babuon,2005/01/20,104,94

There wasn't a single likable character in the whole lot of these NYC losers. The directing was, for the most part, very amateurish and inconsistent. And the violence was, at times, almost laughable. This, to me, was not in any way a satisfying movie-experience, yet people seem to, literally, fall all over themselves, heaping unwarranted praise on it. Personally, I think that most of these people who love Taxi Driver to pieces are probably now in their 50s and 60s. These people saw this film when it was first released in movie theaters back in 1976. And due to a sense of blind-nostalgia they continue to perceive this movie through rose-colored glasses. And, with that, there's absolutely nothing anyone can say that can shake that almost-senile sentimentality out of their little heads.",1.0,roddekker,2015/05/02,162,90
1772,Taxi Driver,A Major Borefest,"What a sorry excuse of a movie and a waste of 2 hours of my life. Don't get me wrong, I like old movies, from the musicals, to the epics and any well acted movies. I bought the DVD thinking that this was a highly rated classic from the 70s. What it really is actually is a 2 hours borefest with dull acting and practically nothing happening for the first 65-70 mins of the movie. The story revolves around a lonely 26 years old taxi driver that was a loner and outcast and clearly have physcological issues. His ill-conceived atttempts to woo a young women named Betsy backfired and push him finally into mental instability. Then as if suddenly realizing that there is clearly nothing much in both the script and the story line in this sorry excuse for a movie, the Director saw fit to inject the last 10 mins with a meaningless violent bloody gunfight. The entire movie is so meaningless that people must be blind to rate this as a classic. I urge anyone thinking of renting or buying this movie to think twice. Don't throw away 2 hours of your life watching this piece of crap.",1.0,bl232,2011/05/17,189,93
1773,Spider-Man 2,"Well worth the wait, what a movie!","Spider-Man 2 picks up where the original film left off, this time showing the more difficult hardships of being a superhero. Standing in the way is Dr. Otto Octavius(Doc Ock) a brilliant scientist whose fusion experiment goes awry at a demonstration Peter attends. The story, and characters are fleshed out more this time out, as well as the effects. Kirsten Dunst is more convincing as MJ, she seemed a little flat in the role last time. Here she, like the rest of the cast, do a convincing job. The top performance has to go to Alfred Molina. In the short screen time Otto has before he becomes a diabolical powerhouse supervillain, he is an endearing, likable person. Spider-Man 2 also offers more confidence in it's story telling. The ""raindrops"" sequence is an evident example. Not afraid to go full nine, this movie is the definitive comic book movie, possessing action, drama, comedy, and message(without being too preachy). Director Sam Raimi and crew really nailed it this time around. Be sure to check out comic artist Alex Ross' paintings spliced in the opening credits, entailing the events of the first film. A great opening to a great film.",10.0,mfoley84,2004/06/30,186,134
1774,Taxi Driver,Typical 70'ies trash...,"Taxi Driver is one of the most overrated movies of all time. I'ts considered a masterpiece but let me tell you, it's not. The running time of a little under two hours drags a long at such a slow pace that it feels like 3 hours. Robert De Niro is convincing as the unstable Travis Bickle and he's the only reason I was able to watch the whole movie. This is a typical 70'ies movie. It's depressing with an annoying misplaced soundtrack. And peoples clothes and haircuts makes it impossible to take it seriously. If you expect this movie to be a vengeance movie, you will be disappointed. Nothing happens for the first hour and a half. Travis drives fares all over New York, dates some pretty blonde, until she dumps him and every 5 minutes you have to listen to his annoying monologue. And then when something does finally happen, it's over in 5 minutes. Realistic? probably, but also extremely boring. Harvey Keitel is unconvincing as Matthew the pimp selling out Iris (Jodie Foster) Jodie Foster is hardly in the movie at all. Save yourself the boring torture and find the famous ""you talking to me"" speech on YouTube. I sure wish I had.",1.0,tstudstrup,2016/10/09,45,19
1775,Interstellar,Disappointing,"So, did I get this right? The essence of time-space relativity is that you're able to see a younger version of yourself from behind a bookcase, and shout in vain that you shouldn't do what you're about to do? Yes, that's how silly this movie is. 'Interstellar' is supposed to be a film exploring Einstein's relativity theory. It shows how space travelers enter a 'wormhole' to find new planets where they can find a future for mankind, which is suffering from heat, drought and hunger on planet Earth. By doing so, they enter a parallel time frame where one hour equals seven years on earth. The problem is that the film is tackling this subject in such a clumsy way that it makes you laugh rather than anything else. Take the robots that assist the space travelers during their voyage through time and space. Are we really to believe that thinking computers in the future would take the form of clunky metal boxes, assembled in such a way that they can walk on two legs? I would suppose an intelligent operating system for a smart phone or iPad would be much more convenient. In that respect, 'Her' was much more realistic. I could go on. How about a top scientist saying things like: 'Only love transcends time and space, so why don't we put our trust in that?' Or how about handing the command of the space ship that's supposed to save the human race to a farmer who finds the secret launching pad by coincidence? And how about the only woman in the crew being in love with another space traveler who is lost somewhere on another planet? Apart from this, there are several other things about this film I didn't like. The over-the-top soundtrack, filled with some sort of church organ music. The artificial dialogues, mostly intended to explain unexplainable things. The numerous melodramatic and tear-jerking scenes. The subtle message that love is superior to science. The countless scenes of the space ship shuddering and rattling, as if it were a Boeing flying through a patch of turbulence. I had hoped this big budget production by a talented director like Christopher Nolan could appeal to non sci-fi fans like me. But I was disappointed.",5.0,rubenm,2014/11/11,277,124

Both shine brightly in this movie and suck you in from the get- go. Following up their (sibling) pairing in Divergent, they both flash a wide range of chops here. Woodley is charming and smart, and Elgort majorly surprised me showing off a comical side. Also very smart. I won't spoil anything, but I did not read the book so I had no/low expectations and was sucked in early on, and definitely was attached to the characters throughout.

1777,Intermission,"Fun, poignant ensemble film","I always look forward to stories in which many lives intersect, as they present an opportunity for vivacious dialogue, great attention to detail, and for gathering talented ensemble casts. ""Intermission"" takes this opportunity to the max! The script is funny and touching, the jokes are original and unexpected, and the quirky details provide insight to the characters, e.g. Detective Jerry Lynch's music of choice. The cast deserves a paragraph all their own. Everyone is terrific, particularly Colin Farrell, whose Lehiff is as unpredictable as he is wacky; Cillian Murphy (John), who is a treat as the good guy pining for his girl; and David Wilmot (Oscar) as John's best friend and quite a comic relief. Excellent film, which makes you cheer and leaves you smiling. 9/10",,LondonOnMyMind,2004/10/22,5,0
1778,Hotel Transylvania,YOUR ZING WILL COME,"The film opens with a loving nurturing Dracula caring for his daughter in 1895. In order to protect her from evil humans he constructs a huge castle as a refuge for monsters which include, Frankenstein, wolfman, invisible man, bigfoot, zombies, ghouls, Quasimodo etc. We then move to the present as his teen looking daughter turns 118 and wants to see the world. Before the first human shows up we already know the script. There were a number of fun things about the monsters that kids would enjoy but adults will find tiresome. Dracula constantly denies saying ""blah, ba-blah, ba-blah."" There is one scene the kids laughed at and that was when someone pulled down the swimming trunks of the Invisible Man. He quickly pulls them back up, tells people ""I just got out of the pool! It's cold! Don't judge me!"" At one point the Invisible Man is playing charades, which he admits, ""I'm not very good at."" At one point Dracula asks if humans would accept them (the monsters) if they ""came out."" I'm sure there was some kind of message there. As an adult, I was basically bored with the film which had such great potential. 4 stars from a kids view. Not really scary or funny.",9.0,nogodnomasters,2018/07/23,1,1
1779,The Fault in Our Stars,Shailene Woodley gives phenomenal performance in a solid film,"This movie took me by surprise. Usually this kind of young adult fare isn't something I go for.. Too watered down and formulaic. And although this one does sometimes stray into pandering melodrama, it's for the most part made with a blunt, matter of fact clarity and heart wrenching realism that needs to be commended. Shailene Woodley has been on the map for a while now, and although she sometimes phones it in in mediocre projects (cough Divergent cough), she has a magnetic star quality and gravitas that pulls you in. She is unbelievable here, playing a hard luck girl in an agonizing situation that no one should have to go through. There are two scenes that she just nails, and raise her performance to award worthy quality. After seeing her in Descendants, White Bird In A Blizzard and now this, I can say she's a new favourite. Ansel Elgort is charming, life affirming as gives excellent work as a fellow cancer patient who falls madly in love with Woodley's character, Hazel Grace. Old pros Laura Dern and Willem Dafoe are superb in supporting roles. At one point Dern say something like "" It's how people have always dealt with pain... You just do it."" This film takes that simple piece of advice and makes its characters make decisions and act accordingly.. Yes what they are going through is horrible, heartbreaking, tragic stuff, but it doesn't cancel out the fact that you are LIVING through it, and can make the choice to do just that: live with whatever time you have, and deal with it as best you can. This is what sets the film apart from a lot of other films of its type.",9.0,NateWatchesCoolMovies,2015/05/23,9,6
1780,Spider-Man 2,Truly Outdoes the First,"Wow. That's all I can manage to say after watching this film, wow. This movie really blew me away in all its aspects. The performances were top rate, especially Alfred Molina's portrayal of Dr. Otto Octavius. He really knows how to play that comic book villain with a sense of understanding so to speak. Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst romance is a truly interesting and different outlook on being a super hero. We often dream of being super heroes, and yet here we see just the opposite. The audience feels Peter's conflict between protecting the innocent and letting his own life suffer or letting it go and living the life he's always wanted. To get everything he ever desired, he must give up his double-life. Despite whether he gives up being Spider-man or not, he will still forever have to deal with the complication of his dying friendship with Harry Osborn( James Franco). Franco is my favorite actor in this film, a young millionaire dealing with the death of his father, his friend being the only one who can help him bring the murder to justice. And yet, unbeknownst to him, his friend is actually the wall crawler himself. A extremely well done screenplay. Sam Raimi adds touches of humor to the story and it blends in quite well. The characters are just so well done and intertwined with one another. Sam Raimi makes more than just a comic blockbuster but a well-defined drama of sorts. Even the villain has his moments. The action is unbelievable and truly out does the first. Future superhero films will have to work hard to surpass what is seen here. The train chase is by far my favorite scene in the film, truly adrenaline pumping!! Audiences do have to wait a bit, but once a fight starts prepare to be simply amazed. Not only this, but the score is magnificent!! I love Danny Elfman!! It captures each moment exactly the way audiences envision it. Another sequel is surely on the way. This is definitely one of my favorite films of 2004, putting other comic book films of the same year to shame, such as ""Blade: Trinity"".",10.0,gigan-92,2009/09/24,35,24

The only reason I didn't skip through it is because it was hard enough to follow at normal speed, and in a foreign language to boot! I DESPISE cowardly film makers who can't commit to a coherent ending. You're in the wrong field, ya time wasting losers. Either grow a pair or GTHO of the biz.

I guess I got fear from this movie, but I do not know about ""primal fear."" What was so primal about it?

1783,Blackfish,An eye opener,"Eye opening expose of the back story of Tilikum, the Orca that killed at least two people. Tilikum's life story is heartbreaking. Sea World's cynical and dishonest handling of this incident as well as other aggressive behavior against humans is outrageous. There are a number of aggressive incidents by Orcas on their trainers that were covered up even from other trainers who needed to know. Tilikum's attack did not happen in a vacuum. Callous behavior towards Orcas, an intelligent affectionate animal continues because of money and, perhaps, denial on the part of management. To know the horrifying reasons for Tilikum's behavior is reason enough to see the film. As distressing as these killings are your sympathies are likely to be with Tilikum as well as with the hapless, innocent trainers who walked into these situations naive about what had happened in the past. ""Blackfish"" will hold your attention. It is more than just an expose. ""Blackfish"" is a well crafted and compelling story. You will not be bored.",10.0,gopal4320-840-668506,2013/12/15,9,8
1784,Detachment,Painfully realistic... and a-must-see for certain viewer groups,"With the enhancement of freedoms and democracy, regulations were introduced to protect the so-called weaker strata, minorities etc. Unfortunately, there are several cases where the latter have abused / misused them, making trouble and creating discontent among the others. School is one of those micro-societies where some students go to the limit, but the adults (parents, teachers etc) are those imputed. Detachment gives a realistic overview of those issues, including different types of teachers and their views of life and the arisen situation. The cast is interesting: apart from Adrien Brody as Henry Barthes (really leading character, there are a few scenes without him), there are several action movie performers (e.g., James Caan, Tim Blake Nelson, Lucy Liu) depicting school personnel with serious issues. In general, all the cast is up to their task, there are no unreal types. This movie should be watched by teachers, parents, social workers, representatives of various protection organizations...

It was so predictable. For instance, from the second the young Latino guy showed up you just knew that he would be a really nice guy because he looked like a gangbanger. Matt Dillon's character has been played a million times, a cop who had been hardened over the years and would see the light to some degree by the end of the movie. The predictability hardly ended with those characters. A phenomenal cast was wasted on a weak script. The morals of the story were PC to the max. There were a few clever twists but not nearly enough. The dialouge was embarrassing at times. It wasn't all bad.I just can't believe this movies high score so far. It was somewhat entertaining, just a little insulting to ones intelligence.

Iam a big fan of almost every movie genre there is, you just cant say that one type of genre are all bad. Keep a open mind. But of course there are good and lesser good movies . Goodfellas are one of the best gangster/mafia films ever made, you got the best actors ,like Joe Pesci ,Robert De Niro and Ray Liotta. Ray did his best performance ever. For me this movie just have a very mafia is feeling surrounding the hole story. And we can all give Martin Scorsese the full honor for that . Like in many other films. Eks.Casino. In Goodfellas you have a lot of scenes that are so well played, you can see the camera standing on one place all trough a scene,filming three or four guys and still the realness don't disappear for one sec. They make us believe it. That is damn good acting. So if you don't think Goodfellas is a movie worth seeing, take a closer look. Leon Ya",10.0,lal-olse,2006/11/09,5,3
1787,Moon,Fantastic...,"In short, this is one of the best sci-fi movies I have seen in a LONG time. Sam Rockwell plays it perfect, making the viewer feel his isolation and lonelieness. For a low budget film, the few effect shots work seamlessly. I'm trying to remain spoiler free, so I won't bother to explain the plot. If you like older and more story/character driven sci-fi, such as 2001: A Space Odyssey, than chances are you will love this movie. If you aren't a huge fan of sci-fi, take a chance with this one. You may find it a very rewarding experience. I loved this movie, and I can't stop thinking about it. In Moon, you may begin to think that everything is a big cliché, but than with all of the seemingly cliché plot points, Moon changes them into something entirely original and unexpected.

""Crash"" is to Spike Lee's magnum opus ""Do the Right Thing"" what ground beef is to fillet mignon. The problems start with casting. Sandra Bullock as an over the top racist? Give me a break. She is America's sweetheart and so well known as just that that it is impossible to buy her opening racist tirade as well as everything else that follows. It only gets worse from there. Though Matt Dillon does his best to convince us he is also an over the top ""nigger hater"", his performance is earnest but misses the mark by miles. Don Cheadle only adds to the ridiculous ""Everyone hates everyone else because of their ethnicity"" tone of this farce. Not one character in this entire film rings true. Not one! Don't waste your time on ""Trash""!

1789,Intermission,Possibly the weirdest movie i have ever seen,"this movie is pretty weird, think love actually but Irish and a lot less safe with absurd characters. don't be turned off by that comment because you don't like love actually, i myself very much disliked it but found this movie really good. I'm just comparing the two due to the formula of having several interconnecting stories and how each character has a sort of conclusion to them. each character in this movie faces their own problems and seeks something, yet whether or not they find it is a different story. i'm a fan of colin farrell and will admit that it was disappointing to see that he didn't have much screen time. however he does steal the show for most of his scenes. cillian murphy is the lead and he is a pretty good character though he is completely normal compared to colin farrell. but still fitting to the movie as most audiences require a fairly relateable character. what i liked about the colin farrell character was that he was completely un like able. no spoilers here but the opening scene in the movie was just gold. colm meaney was great as always, playing a violent policeman who has it in for colin farrell's character. and i was quite impressed by the character of Oscar, i'm unsure of the actor (i assume he is fairly unknown) who is an unconfident young man who wants a relationship. this movie does have a few moments that i didn't particularly like, such as sally who would be a reasonably attractive girl, but seeing her 'ronnie' is disturbing. but of course things come through in the end so all previous critisisms aside. this movie would be a 7 but due to the end credits song 'i fought the law and the law won' (performed by Colin Farrell) it's worthy of an 8. see this movie if you are looking for something different.",7.0,timoth93,2008/12/28,1,1

After they have manufactured the units, daddy totally screws them over, as he planned to all along. The guys find themselves out $500,000 and have lost rights to their product. It's time to take their usual ineffectual action. And this time, they have an unlikely ally. The usual suspects are back - Jennifer Aniston. Kevin Spacey, Jamie Foxx, and they're all very good.

1791,Spider-Man 2,An entertaining blockbuster with brains,"Sam Raimi's 2002 adaptation of the ""Spider-Man"" comic books was a phenomenal success and whether or not to green-light a sequel was a ""no-brainer"" for the studio. However, sequels always bring higher expectations and often, as the sequel to this film shows, disappointment. With ""Spider-Man 2"", Raimi pulls off that rarest of cinematic successes. It is a sequel that is better than the original. The strength of the ""Spider-Man"" films lies in the central character. How Peter Parker deals with this stroke of fate and the stress on him being an ordinary man, and a young one at that, in an extraordinary position of responsibility creates a great deal of sympathy and depth. It is a role that Maguire is ideally suited for and his performance makes this more than just a simple blockbuster. It is a light-hearted drama. It has been described as ""subversive"" by some and that is an apt description. It sits right at the top of the great summer blockbusters of this decade, a list that includes ""Batman Begins"" and the ""Bourne"" series. But, it certainly doesn't shirk on its duty to entertain. Sam Raimi is a born entertainer and he doesn't pull any punches here, quite literally. The action comes thick and fast. All of the set-pieces are eye-popping and inventive. The first hour, in fact, is spectacular. There is stunning action, breathtaking visuals, interesting character development and lots of brilliant humour. It opens as a pretty light-hearted affair and this is not really an example of a sequel going ""darker"". The birth of this film's villain, as it was in the prequel, is the result of a tragic accident and there is no suggestion that he is truly evil. The second hour is grittier, but not darker. It is a completely satisfying film that never bores, but Raimi can't quite hold himself back at points. The final scene should be awfully melodramatic, because it is, but it is forgiven on the basis of the rest of the film. The other failing is that the villain, Doctor Octopus, brilliantly played by Alfred Molina, doesn't get nearly enough screen time. The main focus of the film is Parker's struggle with himself and his desires, but it comes across as pretty much the only focus. There is an interesting ""Jekyll and Hyde"" duality in the ""Doc Ock"" character, but this isn't really explored. There aren't enough internal struggles to make the character believable at points. Though, this should not take away from the many positives of the film. Mention must be made of J.K. Simmons, who is brilliant as J. Jonah Jameson. If this performance were in an offbeat comedy, he would have got an Oscar nomination. And don't forget Bruce Campbell's cameo as the ""Snooty Usher"". All in all, that makes for a completely entertaining two hours. In every way, this film justifies a sequel. In fact, it's a ""no-brainer"". What a shame that the sequel turned out to be exactly that.",8.0,blackburnj-1,2008/02/17,6,5
1792,Primal Fear,Nutritionally empty,"This movie is so rife with conventions and clichés from 1996 that it smells to high heaven. As the movie opens, it takes no more than 4 minutes to figure out that (1) a murdered priest will turn out to be pervert. (2) Put upon Edward Norton will be found innocent. (3) The outwardly moral milieu (the Cathloic priesthood) will emerge as corrupt through and through. And that (4) Gere, an apparent dog, will in some way be shown to be a good guy. The good guys think they've made their case when poor Norton turns out to have a split personality (eyes rolling). It comes with little satisfaction that the split personality is a ruse to yank the chain of some enlightened, well-intentioned figures. Stir in the ""courtroom drama"" genre which always comes with outbursts and surprise testimony, and it's just putrid on putrid. The tacked-on twist ending meant to excuse/reverse all the clichés we've endured is simply absurd. Let's just call it a 'twit' ending. It looks better than a movie like this would in the 60s (location photography) but it doesn't matter.

Morange has a prodigious voice. The surveyor helps the children through music to be motivated on other things. Sometimes someone, as the surveyor, can help you discover yourself that otherwise you would have never known. I strongly recommend the film to everyone, specially to children (as me).

1794,Crash,Pretty bad,"This was a pretty bad film. To be fair, I thought it was better than the one-star rating I gave it here, but I felt morally compelled to vote it thusly just to counter-balance the staggeringly incomprehensible positive votes that it received. That this mess won Best Picture is horrific. Indeed, its winning of Best Picture was the only reason I saw it. I had low expectations going in, expecting it to be heavy-handed and preachy; perhaps for this reason I wasn't so offended by its copious heavy-handed preachiness. It managed to hold my attention for the most part. But there is an awful lot to throw darts at here. I will confine myself to what I consider the most egregious problem, which was the contrived nature of the whole thing. In a nutshell, most of the characters just flat-out don't work. That is to say, the end up doing or saying things that make NO SENSE within the context of what we already know about the character. This is because the relentless point-of-view of this film is supposed to be that EVERYBODY is both good and bad, so that every racist character has to be shown to have a good side, and every good character has to be shown to have a racist side. But with dogged determination to shove every character through this cookie-cutter, very little effort is expended to actually *develop* the characters in such a way as to make both sides of them seem credible. So we get such out-of-the-blue nonsense as having the otherwise-perfectly-unracist detective spout a bit of anti-Hispanic bigotry at the woman he's sleeping with-- with nothing before or after to make that make sense. Same with the ""good cop"" guy, who has very consistently shown to abhor racism and be a good guy-- until suddenly he gets all worked up over nothing and shoots the black guy for nothing. And it works the other way. The bitchy racist DA's wife, in the end *preposterously* decides that the Hispanic maid is actually her best friend??? With *hugs*?? You don't even get the sense that she hugs her *husband* with that much affection. How did *that* fit the character??? The answer, in all cases, is that it DOESN'T fit the character; the movie makers simply felt that all they had to do to show that even good people are racists is to show us good people and then have them, for no reason, act racist for a little while. It's like trying to prove a point by simply asserting it over and over again, rather than bringing in any logic or facts to the argument. I could make a great film demonstrating how, really, EVERYBODY likes strawberry ice cream, by simply showing a lot of people eating and enjoying strawberry ice cream-- even those who claim they don't like strawberry ice cream.

I don't think any other actor could have pulled this part of with such (apparent) ease. The story is not an optimistic one but shows a lot of pitfalls in modern educational environments, be it schools or at home. Apathy and disinterestedness are shown as the things that keep children from reaching their full potential. Style and tempo of the direction and cinematography convey a feeling of inevitability and tragedy. This movie is a must see for any educator.",8.0,Bostroljager,2012/07/30,5,4

This is an amazing movie, and i urge everyone to see it!

1797,Goodfellas,The Mob...Revealed,"The movie that dispelled the romantic myths about La Cosa Nostra and showed it as it really was. ""The Godfather"" for the 90's minus the silly notions of love, honor, and family. Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) is a half-Irish, half-Italian who rises to prominence in Paul Cicero's (Paul Sorvino) Lucchese Crime Family along with Jimmy Conway (Robert DeNiro) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci). This is his story of hi-jacking, stealing, cheating, killing and finally drug dealing. He makes no excuses about what he does. Simply put he is just doing business and trying to survive on the mean streets of New York City. He explains the trials and tribulations of being a mobster and what it's like to have to do these things and live with the consequences. Cicero, an aging old-time underboss, heads a dangerous and powerful organization that enjoys free reign over the neighborhood in which Hill lives and recruits him when he is only a kid to work for them and learn to ""score"" more specifically, the art of committing crime. Hill quickly hooks up with veteran criminal Jimmy ""The Gent"" and his protege Tommy to hi-jack trucks from the Idlewild Airport. This makes these three rich and respected in the underworld but there is a new game in town. Narcotics. They quickly undertake this highly profitable business even though they know it is against the expressed rules of Paulie. This combined with another serious rule violation and the score of a lifetime sets them up for their own possible demise. Lorraine Bracco co-stars as Henry's wife. A marvelous true life story of one of the most violent and profitable street crews in the history of the American Mafia. The best movie of 1990.",,arthurclay,2004/08/29,10,8
1798,Blackfish,Most People will be Shocked...,"....For others it will unfortunately confirm what we already knew.

Trainers don't need to put their life at risk trying to train a non domestic animal. People rarely get to see what goes on behind the scenes but the creators of this movie did a wonderful job of exposing the hypocrisy tastefully. Nothing is said through opinion, only facts and evidence. Everyone who ""loves animals"" should watch this film, it will change your perspective on captivity for the rest of your life.

1799,October Sky,One of those feel-good films,"'October Sky' is a film about a group of young boys in a troubled mid-western coal-mining village who have the dream about creating rockets. This hobby leads them on to some exciting and wider events and recognition. It is ultimately a film about an unsung hero and his troubled family life with an over-bearing father who wants to make a better life for himself. It's a film about hope and dreams. Although the story itself is engaging and emotional, the film is too full of clichés for my tastes. It is one of those films that gives you hope and makes you feel good. It teaches that people who put their mind to something can achieve some important recognition. This film makes life seem so simple, which is great if you enjoy films like that but annoying if you were hoping for a little bit more. There are many films that follow a similar mold, and one of these is Field of Dreams.",5.0,rebeljenn,2006/02/25,12,6

My congratulations to everyone connected with this fine film. Anyone who enjoyed this film should read the book it was based on (also called ""October Sky"", but originally published as ""Rocket Boys"").

1801,Ferris Bueller's Day Off,John Hughes' Only Good Film,"Perhaps John Hughes' hostage to fortune, certainly the only one of his films as director that has some--not a lot, but some--of the devil-may-care attitude of his days as a writer for the National Lampoon, when writing about sex with teenagers was his forte. Matthew Broderick stars as the antithesis of Hughes' usual sad sack heroes, a smarmy, cocksure, insanely popular high school senior with an optimistic, yet realistic, outlook on life who decides to cut school along with his girlfriend (Mia Sara) and best friend (Alan Ruck) and spend the day seeing the sights of Chicago; meanwhile his antagonist, Principal Rooney (Jeffrey Jones), plots his capture. Broderick is genuinely charming and perfectly cast as the sophisticated yet sweetly dorky kid that the director clearly wishes he had been and when Broderick's doing nothing but cajoling and insinuating, he fills the film with a heart that Hughes' other films sorely lack. It's all terrific, inspired fun until the third act when Hughes trudges out his usual collegiate psychobabble aimed squarely at the lesser characters of Ruck and Sara; then the whole thing submerges into the usual deep self-pity that renders his movies unbearable. With Jennifer Grey as Broderick's sister, herself a model of crack comic timing, and Charlie Sheen, uproarious in a scene-stealing cameo, as a placid, monosyllabic burnout with the wisdom of a Confucius.",7.0,bix171,2003/02/03,5,3

Quite a watchable thriller, really, but left me very uncomfortable. I'm a white Englishman, but even for me the words ""Uncle Tom"" were hovering in the air and refused to go away. OK, the plot device of the automatic assumption of guilt and wrongful arrest of the big black guy only worked if he was black. But the - apparently surprising - fact that he could be huge and black but still ""nice"" then seemed to be a central part of the plot. The only thing this story reveals is the prejudice and bigotry of the writer and his intended audience.",3.0,neil-321,2006/01/31,16,7
1806,Crash,Great acting ensemble but the movie left a bad taste in my mouth,"THE GOOD: The acting were great especially Terrence Howard and Thandie Newton. Terrence Howard should have been nominated for Best Supporting Actor instead of Matt Dillon. THE BAD: I'm a visible minority (non-white) and I have experienced some form of racism in my life. BUT despite my life experiences and the movie's subject matter, I would definitely NOT say that this movie is the best of the year, in fact, it's FAR from it. I have problems with this movie both from a moviegoer's perspective and from a visible minority's perspective. Some of my problems with this movie are: (1) Poor character development (or none at all). Just because we saw extremes in a character, for example, Matt Dillon being a racist cop and being a good caregiver to his ailing father, that does not mean in any way that the character is well-developed. Yes, I admit that in a big cast ensemble like in this movie, it is quite difficult for every character to be well-developed, BUT that does not mean that at none of the characters should be like that. (2) The dialogue seems really contrived to the point that I'm really surprised this movie won for Best Original Screenplay. They should show this movie in a screenplay writing class NOT because it's good but to show students and future screenplay writers what NOT to do. I just felt like I've been hit by the head over and over again how bad racism is. I get it. (3) The plot seems so coincidental, it is laughable. What are the chances of a black car robber running over an Asian guy who also happens to be a human trafficker while entering his van, and that same black car robber ended up carjacking that Asian guy's van several hours later after he brought him the hospital, only to find out that the several Asians being trafficked inside the van just to show you that the black car robber has a good side after all? Or, what about that scene where a prejudiced upper-class white woman who fell down the stairs and all her prejudice and hatred vanished into thin air? If it was THAT simple, why don't we throw every racist in America down the stairs so they will have a change of heart? (4) I think my biggest misgivings about this movie is the unrealistic view of racism. As someone who has experienced racism in my life, the realistic view of racism is that it is hidden rather than in your face. I've been refused to enter a supermarket because I'm not white. Did the store owner said because I was not white? No, he said the store was closing even though there were a lot of people shopping inside. Did he yell racial slurs? No. Racism in America is more hidden. Some cab drivers probably won't stop to pick you up because you're non-white but that does not mean that they will try to run you over or get out and say racial slurs. If a Chinese woman rear-ended me, I won't be saying ""blake! blake! Learn some English bitch!"". On the other hand, if I was a Chinese woman and I accidentally rear-ended a Mexican woman, I won't say ""Mexicans are bad drivers"" in front of her face. That's not how things work. Instead, I would give out my insurance info, say sorry, and go home and tell my fellow Chinese friends and family that Mexicans are poor drivers and make fun of them behind their backs. That is the real racism. It's hidden and not in your face. Anyway, Crash is not original unlike what some people may say. The interlocking and interweaving story lines, plots, and characters have been done before. ""Magnolia"" is a movie that does this much better than Crash did and yet, it was never nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars. It had a stellar cast -- Julianne Moore, William H. Macy, Phillip Seymour Hoffman (who won best Actor recently), Tom Cruise, etc. It really boggles my mind how Crash was even nominated for Best Picture.",4.0,heymikey1981,2006/03/07,296,205
1807,Blackfish,We know nothing about these creatures,"I am always skeptical when watching a documentary, always considering whether someone's personal agenda is being unfairly promoted in a one- sided documentary. As you watch this movie and you compare it to the time line of events reported in national news, you realize that this movie really did an amazing job at laying out all of the facts that are publicly available. In a world where emotion and logic do not necessarily align, the interviews in this movie were so incredibly heartfelt and yet so logical. Unlike some documentaries that distort the facts, this movie did not have a deceptive narrator or a comic relief script. This documentary is composed primarily of real interviews with video footage to demonstrate the basis for the interview responses. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves animals or is curious about animals. It covers many interesting facts about killer whales including social structure, family hierarchy, brain function, separation anxiety, maternal grief, wild behaviors, captive behaviors, Pavlovian conditional training, effect of reward and punishment, accidental violent behaviors, deliberate violent behaviors, how killer whales are captured, how killer whales are bred in captivity, and causes of death in captivity. The more we learn about killer whales, the more we begin to realize that we know nothing about these creatures. If violent human behavior cannot be prevented 100% of the time, how can the same be expected from wild carnivores?",10.0,Matt-441,2013/12/16,15,12
1808,October Sky,3 movies rated 10 in my life this is one of them,First off I have to say I love moving movies and October Sky rates very in this category. I first watched (Rocky) in 1977 and thus began my #10 rated list that would fail to find an addition until 18 years later (8-Seconds). One night in Atlanta in 1999 I felt very lonely (being I was on a 6 month job that took me 600 miles from home) so I decided to go see a movie. I wasn't in the mood for an action type so the display of October Sky grabbed my attention. I watched in amazement as the stories events unfolded. I actually got lost in the movie to where my loneliness had left my senses. I liked it so much I paid to see it 2 more times the same week. I find it best to watch unknowingly what it's about.

1812,The Wailing,"It must be the ""Jap"" that's causing it!","The little girl was very good in this movie, the locations and cinematography were very pleasant and atmospheric, plus the makeup effects were very high quality. There are a few issues however. The first issue is the blatant racism. The ""Jap"" who lives near the village is insinuated as the cause of the horrific scenes unfolding before the villagers; No particular reason why this is so; it's just that he's a Japanese man- (who apparently turns out to be the devil... I think), and that's good enough reason thank you very much! Next, after what felt like 2 hours already, we are led to believe it wasn't the ""Jap"", but some girl... for some reason. But then after another 50 minutes it wasn't her, but the ""Jap"" anyway.. for no particular reason. By this point he turns into the devil... I assume he was- my brain was numb by this point, so I was eyeing the exit sign mostly. Basically it is way, way, way too long. Lastly, why do the characters treat each over so poorly? Almost every line in this is an aggressive bark. It's basically like ""pass me the salt and pepper as***le! the whole way through. But's it's not just the men, it's the grannies, wives and children all getting in on the action in an unrelenting barrage of sh**ty attitudes. It's very unpleasant to watch for 2 and a half hours. Like I mentioned, the young actor was very, very impressive as the exorcist style demonic possessed little girl- but with everyone around her acting like complete pricks the whole movie, it's not as effective as the original. All up, not a bad movie- ambitious and effective at key points, but I would have preferred to watch this in 2 or 3 sittings on DVD, and preferably with a couple of paracetamols on hand.

1813,Detachment,not easy watching but brilliant,"Adrien Brody was superb in this hard-hitting, traumatic-watching drama about a substitute teacher with high ideals and standards but fighting against personal demons in his past, difficulties in his every day life and working at a school where the children run amok and the teachers are brow-beaten and broken specimens of pedagogy. Mr Barthes (Brody) is a brilliant and inspiring teacher and a moral man, but struggling. There are powerful performances by a glittering ensemble cast; with honourable mention going to Lucy Liu, James Caan and the newly introduced Sami Gayle as young prostitute Erica. Also well acted was Betty Kaye as troubled Meredith, student in Mr Bathes class. This is a stylised documentary-esque film... Brody is interviewed ""in character"" throughout the film and the film is illustrated by chalk on blackboard diagrams and the artwork of Meredith. It doesn't flow as a story/film given the artiness of it, but that adds to the drama and tension of the film and you are left feeling rather frayed at the end. Nothing in the film is ""nice"" and an easy-watch and you are constantly worried what the next revelation will be, but in it is still a gripping and inspirational piece of cinema; the importance of good parenting and the skill and importance of good teachers are highlights. Brody's Mr Bathes is such an inspirational teacher... and you wish there are more like him.",7.0,HelenMary,2013/04/07,5,4

1815,Moon,I Me Mine,"Movies like this, ones that have open seams, are made for me. This happens to me a lot. This is a story with no intended ambiguities. A solitary man on the moon discovers he is an expendable clone, discovering then conspiring with one of his siblings. There is some plotting and a successful escape. We discover things slowly as our hero does, knowing only what he does. It is not complicated. But. But, the thing starts with dreams, and visions brought on by a three year weary solitude. There is a companion supercomputer voiced by (this time the aptly named) Kevin Spacey. We have some hints that we can enter ""his"" mind as well. There are three solid plot seams where we could be entering an imagined or artificial world of the clone's and two seams where we might similarly be entering the computer's. None of these contradict, and we could easily be watching a ping pong match (one is shown) where alternative universes driven by urges are buffeted by different consciousnesses. I do believe that strong stories have these seams, even though the writer expects few people to nuzzle into them. That some do, that I do, possibly adds to the richness for the average viewer, knowing that there is danger outside of the station. Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",,tedg,2010/04/14,12,6

For something like this to work in our wonderful new millennium, you really need to instill the basic story arc with an interesting subplot and then some; i.e. some conflict extending beyond the basic premise which is exactly what this brain sore is so painfully lacking. The film scores well here and on other movie related websites, which is probably because anyone who has ever seen an episode of Star Trek or dared to read an actual SF book, turned the movie off after 30 minutes and couldn't be bothered to leave a vote.",1.0,boris-karloff-1,2012/05/11,64,27
1817,Horrible Bosses 2,Same winning combination as the first movie.,"When their new business fails, lovable losers Nick (Bateman), Kurt (Sudeikis) and Dale (Day) plot their revenge on the slick investor who ripped them off them (Christoph Waltz) by kidnapping his son (Chris Pine) and demanding a ransom. The good news is that Horrible Bosses 2 brings back most of the things fans of the original liked about it. Original horrible bosses Spacey and Aniston get a couple of scenes each, and they are funny. New additions vary in effectiveness. Christoph Waltz and (in particular) Chris Pine are great picks to fill the antagonist slots. It's the same winning combination as the first movie, with silly, hilarious situations , my favorite probably being the Ocean's 11 style slick plan that goes totally haywire. The rude & crude humor, that's trademarked by the R-rated Jennifer Aniston who returns as Sex addicted dentist Julia. Bateman, Sudeikis & Day are on top form, ably supported by the returning characters of aforementioned Jenifer Aniston, Jamie Foxx (Django) as the shady ""MF"" Jones & Kevin Spacey as the hard boiled Harken. The fresh injections of Chirs Pine & Christoph Waltz are class, particularly Pine whose frenetic, zany prankster is priceless. Conclusion, Horrible Bosses 2 is a solid sequel, the continuity of the characters/atmosphere , new story with some surprises up it's sleeve & fresh injection of characters make for a fun time.

John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson are the highlights in the cast and this movie helped their careers a lot. Bruce Willis gives one of his most memorable performances ever as a former boxer that ends to go out of town with his girlfriend after saving his former boss (Ving Rhames) in a holdup. Uma Thurman shines as the boss' wife and in supporting roles Harvey Keitel, Christopher Walken, Eric Stoltz, Rosanna Arquette and Tim Roth are very good and entertaining to watch. Quentin Tarantino's direction is top-notch and the cinematography is slick and stylish. The soundtrack is great and memorable. The only complaint I have is that at times there are some violent moments, but since it's the only problem I cut it here.

1819,Interstellar,A good - not great - movie that falls apart the more you think about it.,"Not many directors have the clout of Christopher Nolan. Most of them receive notes from their fretting studios: suggestions (or demands) to change plot points or highlight certain characters/actors, which must be adhered to for contractual or financial reasons. With huge, intelligent blockbuster successes like the Dark Knight franchise and Inception, Nolan has deservedly won carte blanche from Warner Bros. for Interstellar - he gets garguantan sums of money and complete autonomy to realise his artistic vision. In effect, he's making an indie movie on a blockbuster scale. Ironically, this lack of oversight might be just what keeps Interstellar - a very good, occasionally brilliant foray into the furthest reaches of our galaxy and beyond - from greatness. Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a former pilot and engineer, is now reluctantly scraping together a living as a farmer on a starving Earth. With sandstorms swirling and food supplies dwindling by the day, it doesn't seem likely that Cooper's children, stoic Tom and inquisitive Murphy, will have much of a world left to inherit when they grow up. While investigating a ""ghost"" in Murphy's bedroom, Cooper deciphers a message that brings him to a top-secret NASA base. Once there, Cooper learns from his former mentor, Dr Brand (Michael Caine), that NASA is looking for solutions to Earth's crisis in other galaxies. A recently-opened wormhole has given NASA and its scientists access to a whole new galaxy of planets. Brand appeals to Cooper to pilot the final and most important mission: to determine whether any of three identified planets can truly host human life. But it's a journey from which Cooper might never return - one that will take him away from his kids and everything he has ever known and loved. That's not even the half of it – Nolan's narrative is a sprawling, ambitious one that asks heavy metaphysical questions about the position and role of humanity in the universe, filtered through the prism of a father and daughter whose bond transcends time and space. It's shot through with complex scientific theories about wormholes and time travel courtesy of theoretical physicist Kip Thorne (who served as a consultant on the film). Indeed, much of Interstellar plays with such philosophical gravity that one can't help wondering if it's simply too deep a subject to be effectively communicated in a movie that must also create emotional stakes and real characters. Clocking in at almost three hours, Interstellar pulses with intelligence and occasional bursts of brilliance. The science and emotion of its story works best on each planet they manage to visit, with Nolan crafting some chillingly smart sci-fi moments amidst the human drama experienced by Cooper's crew. As badly as Cooper wants to save enough fuel to make the return trip home, Amelia Brand (Anne Hathaway) has both professional and personal stakes in visiting the planet that's furthest away from the wormhole. They trade hope for time, the minutes they use to hunt for salvation translating into the loss of decades with their loved ones. The film is at its best when the members of the Endurance - including David Gyasi's Romilly and Wes Bentley's Doyle - confront one another, and establish contact (or fail to do so) with the scouting teams that preceded them through the wormhole. But Interstellar also suffers from a bloated and faintly silly final act. The science of it may be well-founded (who knows, after all, what miraculous answers really do lie within a black hole?) and the concept very cool, but it doesn't quite translate as such. Instead, the film hyper-blasts itself into a oddly cheerful (and confusing) ending that feels purely fictional and not at all scientific. There's no denying, either, that Nolan could have carved half an hour or more out of Interstellar without losing any of its narrative or emotional density. Instead, many scenes unfold in an almost obstinately languid fashion, including a moment when Cooper is left gasping for oxygen on the icy terrain of an alien planet. It's pretty evident, too, that Nolan really wanted to make sure his audiences knew how little greenscreen he used to make the film; for no other discernible reason, his camera lingers in extreme close-up - and far too often - on the exterior shells of the various spacecrafts designed for the film. Nolan can afford the best when it comes to his cast as well, and it shows. McConaughey anchors the film with a gravitas and tenderness quite unknown before his career McConnaissance, and he's ably supported by a steely Hathaway, whose character, just like the film she's in, blends cold, pragmatic science with a churning wealth of emotion. Jessica Chastain and Matt Damon, in roles perhaps best left unspecified to avoid any explicit spoilers, are excellent too - the former radiates quite enough warmth and intelligence to make us believe that she can save the world, and the latter admirably treads in morally grey areas to good effect. For months before its release, Nolan kept Interstellar firmly under wraps. Everyone speculated that it would be a game-changer - a sci- fi blockbuster as thrilling and thought-provoking as it is entertaining. In some ways, that's true of the final product: Nolan's film is brave, brainy film-making, and it looks absolutely spectacular. But, on closer examination, Interstellar loses some of its gloss and varnish - and beneath it all lies an unwieldy script that meanders a little too long and wastes a little too much of the big, breathtaking ideas that underpin its story.",7.0,shawneofthedead,2014/11/07,762,368
1820,October Sky,I've Been There and It's Real,"I have yet to read ""The Rocket Boys"", the book upon which this film is based, but this situation will not continue! I did read a short story by Hickam which was apparently the seed that started him on the novel. It grabbed me even then. I am one of those fortunate enough to have lived adjacent to Cape Canaveral during the Mercury program, where my father worked, and this childhood situation no doubt fostered my lifelong interests and hobbies. I also met Werner von Braun, and one of the other German rocket scientists repaired a rubber band driven model plane I had (I WISH I still had that plane!) I mention this because I went into the movie with serious expectations and very much desired to see a film with authentic treatments for the nostalgia and emotions of the period. I was not disappointed. While there were superficial flaws here and there, the movie came together like so few Hollywood films do. Good storytelling, authentic emotions and period atmosphere. As others have experienced at this excellent film, I was choked up at the end and had to wipe away the tears. The father of the family next to me asked to borrow my spare paper napkin to wipe his tears. About half the audience applauded at the end, and most everyone stayed through the credits. It's just one of those films. Not the greatest movie ever made, but one of the best family movies in a long time.",,backseat-2,1999/02/21,82,73
1821,Horrible Bosses 2,I cried... Because it was so funny!,"This Movie is hilarious... I could watch it in Germany almost one week earlier and I was really surprised. I loved the first one, but the second is even better. I could not stop laughing (after the first five minutes I cried), every joke was set so perfectly. Even the story was really surprising and very well accomplished. Jason Bateman, Charlie Day and Jason Sudeikis played their characters incredibly convincing, I could feel the stupidity in some moments. But let's not forget Jennifer Aniston, Chris Pine, Christoph Waltz, Jamie Fox, Kevin Spacey and the director Sean Anders which made this movie so funny and totally worth watching it. I would recommend this film because I can't remember the last time I laughed so hard. If you liked the first one (and even if not) this movie is worth it, you'll not be disappointed. Therefore I rate ""Horrible Bosses 2"" 8 out of 10 because my stomach still hurts from last night.",8.0,Geckomaniac3,2014/11/22,31,16
1822,Pulp Fiction,blood and f****** spirituality,"I think one of the problems many people have with this movie is that it defined and set into motion an extremely irritating trend in contemporary film. The god-awful clones of Tarantino pouring out of indie and mainstream studios alike should not, however, detract from the brilliance and subtlety of this movie. It works simply because those moments of brilliance (I have to admit I know the whole ""Jules redemption-speech"" by heart) that its imitators lack come in the midst of the camp and gore they all do so well. Tarantino alone uses an adolescent obsession with shallowness and morbidity to high satirical effect--like all great films (or even novels), this movie sets itself into a two-dimensional genre (absurd, pop-culture, comic-book situations) and then undermines its own genre by exposing the heart and soul underneath. There are too many points in the movie in which this happens to mention, but a few come to mind: the blown kiss from Vincent to Mia at the end of the first (or maybe second) story; the death of Vincent; the obvious emotional dedication of Butch to his wife at the end of his own story; Vincent's unwillingness to believe in his own supernatural salvation without realizing he's doomed; and, of course, the climactic speech. With the exception of Jules's final words, many of these moments seem at first to be horrifying or funny--but this is only because they fit so well into the flow of the script. A second glance shows them to be moments so poignant that the only reason they work is because they are so unique to the characters and their situations. The changes in each (or the lack of change) come, in a sense, as they individually choose to either drive for them or fall behind. Most die-hard fans of the movie, I'm sure, have heard the story of the briefcase and the band-aids on the back of Wallace's neck (the entire movie being a quest to bring back his stolen soul), and although Tarantino has denied it, he can't deny that the movie is full of such heroic themes: escape by trial, the reclamation of past, love as both physical salvation and personal security, a will to believe in something beyond one's own selfish world. I won't say that if you don't like this movie that you're mistaken or ignorant, but I think that Tarantino puts his audience into settings much like his characters are in: cheap, full of profanity and nastiness, fleeting. The best of them break through; I think he asks that anyone watching do the same.",,leopold-3,1999/01/18,187,93
1823,Taxi Driver,Explains What It`s Like To Be Male,"***** SPOILERS ***** How would anyone be able to relate to Travis Bickle ? He`s a freak show , a fantasist and a loner who watches porn films in cinemas with a cola in one hand and a candy bar in another and to all intents and purposes is an assassin and a stalker , but he also strikes a cord with any man who`s been angry and young and rejected . He`s an outsider that society has turned its back on : "" Why won`t you talk to me "" is the heartbreaking question every young angry man screams at the world when he`s very alone Scorsese directs Paul Schrader`s low concept script on a shoestring budget - That`s not a criticism , quite the reverse because this leads to a hyper-realism and it`d be impossible to think that a major Hollywood studio would produce something like this nowadays where everything is about making money while playing it safe : A character study of a disturbed loner ? 12 year old prostitutes ? Vigilante executions ? Too controversial , not enough explosions , not enough CGI . If there`s a flaw in the screenplay it`s at the end where Travis wipes out the pimp business and becomes a hero which left me confused . Doesn`t society punish murderers even if they kill scum that use 12 year olds as prostitutes ? Even if he was cleared by the jury surely Travis would still have stood trial for murder ? but this is never referred to in the closing scenes , but I guess this is a comment on how society can quickly make a hero out of a villain and how a nobody can become the talk of the town , but still it seems to go against the grain of the script where we - Or at least the young males in the audience - recognise that an uncaring society is the villain where as Travis is the hero all along Despite the flawed ending of the screenplay ( Which is superb untill the last ten minutes ) this is still a movie masterpiece with Scorsese getting an acting tour de force from his cast . Jodie Foster as a child who sells her body on the streets of New York , a totally disturbing , brilliant performance , and DeNiro and Keitel in the same movie ! I`ve no idea if this is just hype but I heard all the stage schools in the USA were swamped at the time by applications from applicants in Compton , Hell`s Kitchen , South Central and The Bronx who`d seen DeNiro and Keitel in the "" I`m hip "" scene ( A scene that was totally adlibbed by the actors ) and decided that acting could be cool and macho after all . As I said I don`t know how true this is but the performances of these two actors has given a massive amount of credibility to the acting profession and it really is sad to see the DeNiro of today churn out so much garbage . This his greatest performance . I also rate it as Scorsese`s best movie As a footnote may I recommend to all the angry young men reading this review to track down the albums of Matt Johnson aka The The especially the mid 80s albums SOUL MINING and INFECTED which have lyrics that could have been written by Travis himself . Matt is a great fan of Scorsese and it shows",9.0,Theo Robertson,2003/09/22,95,61
1824,The Fault in Our Stars,I've never rolled my eyes so much during a movie,"The reason I am rating this a 1 is to combat the insane 8.2 rating that this terrible movie has. I'm a 17 year old girl, and most people would assume someone my age would fall head over heels for a movie like this. I watched expecting to see this amazingly realistic, incomparable, and tragically beautiful love story, which is how TFIOS had been described to me. After spending two hours watching this movie, I'm sitting here wondering if I'm made of stone considering I did not shed a single tear. But several movies I have watched, and stories I have read, have left me sobbing and attempting to recover for days. I have never read the book, or any of John Green's books for that matter but now I will forever hold the opinion that he is a fully grown man attempting to articulate not only the life of a teenage girl, but the life of someone suffering with a disease. The first few lines of the movie, narrated by Hazel, made me know I was going to hate this movie, since she was describing things that happened in cliché romance stories (which is exactly what this is), and how this was ""true."" The idea that this movie was realistic is ridiculous. First of all, a few token one-liners in the movie were clever and well written, but would never come out of a teenager's mouth. As a teenager myself, I can confirm that we are not that profound. I didn't understand the appeal that either of the main characters had in the other, other than the fact they both had cancer. Hazel was boring, and selfish, and self-pitying, and Gus was so pretentious it made me feel sick, and I never believed for a second that he was a virgin. Of course cancer is a terrible thing, as is death itself, but the fact that I didn't care about either of them, and saw them as a caricature of what John Green thinks or wants teenagers with cancer to act like, made me completely indifferent to their predictable demise. The story line with them going to Amsterdam to visit the author of their favorite book was annoying and unnecessary. Although the author was painted as this terrible person, I actually agreed everything that came out of his mouth about Hazel. I'm pretty sure the whole point of that scene was to say ""hey, what can we do to make this movie even more depressing? I know, let's take the one thing that the main character cares about and destroy it, in order to make her completely dependent on her love interest."" There's too many complaints I have about specific eye-roll inducing lines and scenes in this movie to even remember, but the one that angered me more than anything was when they went to the Anne Frank house. First, they tried to compare the horrible death of Anne Frank and her family, which was an outcome of the most horrible thing that has happened in human history, to these teenagers dying with cancer. As soon as they reached the top floor of the house, paying attention only to Hazel struggling to climb the stairs, in my mind I started thinking ""please make them be respectful. I swear, if Gus tries to crack a self-righteous joke I will punch my laptop screen."" At first, I was pleasantly surprised, because they were quiet and solemn, but then, they begin making out... Only to make it worse, everyone in the room begins clapping. Why? If I was there, I would be furious at their lack of respect. I can only hope this scene wasn't filmed in the actual house. Towards the end I was constantly checking the bar at the bottom of my screen to see how long I had left. I kept thinking, when is this really sad part coming that will make me cry? and when the credits started rolling, I realized it never would. The fact that people are describing this piece of trash as the best movie they have ever seen boggles my mind. I'm assuming it's the first movie they have ever seen. If you want to watch a realistic romance movie, you won't find it here. Don't waste your time.",1.0,alexbarnes1129,2014/09/20,436,219

1826,Hotel Transylvania,Bloodless and toothless kiddie faire,"With its plot lifted shamelessly from ""Finding Nemo"" and its overly familiar standard Halloween-mask characters, the basics of ""Hotel Transylvania"" pose no threat to the younger set and no challenge for anyone older. Dialog and plot development match the toothless motif with a big, friendly daddy Dracula defends his monsters-only hotel a la John Cleese in the old British ""Fawlty Towers"" television show (or ""programme"") and tries to keep his daughter from coming of age. The main plot follows precisely the sequence you expect from this premise with the characters growing and coming to terms right on cue. The big name voice actors (Sandler, Samberg, Gomez, etc.) appropriately phone it in given a lack of interesting dialog or witty one-liners. The animation style brings us a lot of warm colors but no technical virtuosity. In short, a non-offensive essential neutral time killer for the five to ten year old set.",5.0,estreet-eva,2012/10/19,7,3
1827,Hotel Transylvania,Yawn!,"I made a lot of attempts to get to see this movie; I was so disappointed after 30 minutes in. I like being surprised by the story a movie delivers, so sometimes instead of reading ahead i just go to the cinema to be surprised. When I found out what the plot was for this movie I felt like shooting myself in the foot for not reading ahead. Produced by Sony Pictures Animation, Hotel Transylvania has been in development since 2006 with Miley Cyrus penned to play the voice of Mavis (Dracula's daughter), but she later dropped the role and Selena Gomez was given the role instead. The movie's idea was to paint a scenario typical to that of Pixar/Disney's Monsters Inc, where the monsters were afraid of the humans, although in this twist the humans seems to love the Monsters. Every movie runs on a typical fuel, Monsters Inc's fuel was they need of screams for their energy, the fuel in this movie is Mavis (Selena Gomez) desire to go to the outside world. This kind of driving force for a movie is too flat based on the fact that the outside world is just outside your door. The voice casting/acting in this movie is not half as bad as the plot. Adam Sandler voiced Dracula and did a fine job at it too. The movie's plot is about Dracula, who lost his wife to an attack by humans. Due to that, he built a hotel where the world's monsters can take a rest from human civilization. In his list of invitees we have 1. Frankenstein and his bride 2. Werewolf, his bride and their liter (and may I tell you they have so much) 3. Mummy 4. Skeleton and bride 5. Invisible man 6. And much more. The movie does try to be funny, with lines like when Dracula told the Invisible man, ""Hello! Great to see you"" The movie director Genndy Tartakovsky is behind the some notable Cartoon Network animated television series, including Dexter's Laboratory, Samurai Jack, Star Wars: Clone Wars, and Sym-Bionic Titan. Genndy will also be directing an animated film based on Popeye. Hotel Transylvania will have been best as a short movie that was like 30 mins long rather than a full length one that has nothing but wasted scenes luring you to an expected end. But putting it all together if you haven't heard of this movie then be happy, you are not missing a thing.",4.0,lagudafuad,2012/10/12,11,5
1828,Pulp Fiction,Popularity and gameplay victory,"The postmodern discourse of the film, because it is in the post-industrial society era, is driven by the commercialization of the consumer society, thus embodying commercial, game, and popular colors. Jameson pointed out that the old (essentially advanced modernist) boundary between the advanced culture and the so-called popular culture or business culture has been abolished, and new texts have emerged that are full of forms, categories and contents of cultural industries. Bourdieu believes that the film has got rid of the shackles of classic art and has become a popular culture or a postmodern culture and has become a cultural capital. The purity of aesthetics and the self-discipline of art have been impacted. The tower of pure aesthetic ivory has collapsed under the impact of popular art and its aesthetics. The ensuing is the appearance of popular aesthetics, and it has increasingly gained its own aesthetic legitimacy. Attracting audiences with popular themes, flattening the depth, everything is flat, this is what distinguishes the serious attitude of postmodernism from modernism. The result is to give the audience leisure, fashion, relaxation, surprise, and no tears. Violence, crime, sex and other generally considered vulgar themes are the themes of postmodern movies. Especially in terms of violent style, Tarantino became a single family. Violence has always been the unshakable theme of Quentin's works, and formed his black violence aesthetics. Violence is bloody, cold, game, and does not carry any moral and political responsibilities. ""Pulp Fiction"" thoroughly stylized and gamified violence. It makes the audience realize that at this moment, you are watching movies for entertainment, so Tarentino will turn violence into joke, sex into joke, politics into joke, and history into joke. It does not ask about the meaning, does not reflect, does not touch politics, not to mention resistance. The ""Bible"" quotes before Jules' killing were not intended to legitimize his murder. Similarly, the scene of Mia's overdose did not have any intention of exhorting drug addicts. ""Black"" has also been treated as a piece of joke. Both Vincent and Jules drove around the city in a car full of brains and blood. In order not to let the police find it, but also in order not to add trouble to their friends, they had to do it within 40 minutes. Cleaning the car is a very technical task, so that they have to hire a special problem-solving expert from the headquarters to guide them in their work. When the two big-hearted men finally washed themselves and the car Afterwards, while wearing two exaggerated and somewhat funny T-shirts standing in front of the camera, a scene full of blood and terror was transformed into a humorous sketch, and the popularity and gameplay are most vividly displayed here. So some people say: ""Pulp Fiction"" completed the transformation of violent movies from modernity to post-modernity, showing that post-modern violent movies have completely lost the power of social criticism, the depth and the profound connection between old movies and the real world. No longer carries the meaning of cultural symbols such as national mythology, heroism, social resistance, political complaints, etc. Some other similar cultural commitments are also taken out, leaving only the image itself. ""And the frequent scenes of violence in the film are echoing Its ""circular structure"" clearly states that the occurrence of violence is cyclical and never stops. ""Pulp Fiction"" tells us: In life, violence, including wars and boxing, is omnipresent. There is no justice in life and death, right or wrong in front of it. Although Quentin Tarantino has never talked about postmodernism, he knows its essence. He seems to tell us that life in the 20th century is developing rapidly, changing fast and worthless. No one is immune. No matter whether life or death is unreasonable and fair Is a ""vulgar novel"", and this is where the subversive power of postmodern cinema aesthetics lies.",10.0,DemonKiki,2020/04/16,9,7

1830,The Chorus,"Simply Superb film starring Gerard Jugnot as a ""failed"" musician that comes to a troubled school and transforms the lives of the boys with the beauty of music.","When I was informed I was being taken to see a film about an old musician teaching a load of boys to sing, I almost yelled in anger. I got even more furious when I discovered that it was a French, subtitled one, despite the fact I am half French and therefore nearly bilingual. Last year at the time, I was 13, and teenage girls wouldn't like this type of film, surely? How wrong could I have been? This beautiful masterpiece is one of my favourite films of ALL TIME. Before this film, I didn't really cry much in films, but now, I blub in almost everything! It's almost as though it awakened a sentimental part of me, as silly as that sounds. Gerard Jugnot is quite simply outstanding in his role as Clement Mathieu, but every single actor in this is totally splendid. You don't need me to tell you the story, no doubt by now, but the final scene where the boys cannot greet Mathieu when he is fired, and so throw paper plane letters out of the window to the beautiful song, ""Cerf-Volant""... is one of the most moving scenes ever. I cried like a tiny child! I couldn't recommend this film more. Coming from a 14 year old girl who is into trendy/sexy films, you can trust me that this is not some frumpy, rubbish, old-fashioned snore-fest. It's quite simply amazing.

And although many people may see it as just that, a stupid teenage love story, I was very positively surprised. It was actually cute and funny, and I really enjoyed it. It might still have a few klischeè teenage movie things, and it might try to be all inspirational, but It felt real and heartfelt. I was also positively surprised by the performances, which were nicely and lovingly done. It was sad but at the same time gave you a warm, chummy feeling. So if you like a good love story that has a little humour to it, but manages to crush you a little as well, I highly recommend this movie.",7.0,dexter-vane,2015/05/20,7,5

1835,The Fault in Our Stars,The Star is Shailene Woodley,"Hazel Grace Lancaster (Shailene Woodley) is tired of her parents (Laura Dern, Sam Trammell)'s help and the support of the support groups. The doctor diagnose her as depressed. That is until she meets Augustus (Ansel Elgort) at a support group meeting. He's a one-legged cancer survivor who share the same view of life. Hazel gives Augustus a book 'An Imperial Affliction' written by Peter Van Houten (Willem Dafoe) to read. Van Houten invites them to visit him in Amsterdam, but the meeting doesn't turn out the way they hoped. This is a perfectly OK teen melodrama with a great performance from Shailene Woodley. She nails this character through the ups and downs. Her scene with Willem Dafoe in Amsterdam is terrific. She doesn't just hold her own but she comes out on top. Ansel Elgort is too one dimensional. I think that has a lot to do with the writing. He is all sugary charms. Even his bad driving is engineered to endear him to the audience. He's not a real person but rather a manufactured character. This movie could do with some swearing. This is where the MPAA rating system really screws with a movie. It's a movie that needs the PG rating. As such, bad language that would fit these characters' situation is just gone. One would expect these characters to have the gallows humor and the swear words to match. I guess there isn't much the filmmakers can truly do about it. One scene that encapsulates the movie for me is the kiss in Anne Frank's house. As the kiss develops, I thought that this is going to be awkward. Once they start kissing, the scene actually is touching. It works and then everybody starts clapping. It becomes over-written. It's a movie with a great young star that is trying to do something interesting but just tries too hard with its writing.",6.0,SnoopyStyle,2014/10/16,7,4
1836,The Fault in Our Stars,We call it LOVE,"Imagining a day without love has become impossible since I watched this movie. No matter which kind of love we focus on, what really matters is this that an antidote to all poisons and a key for all doors has been summarized into 4 words; LOVE. It was a year ago when I started reading John Green's novel, ""The Fault In Our Stars"". I found out from the first pages that at least one guy could finally find a new way to anecdote a romance story and do believe in this fact that this guy could make a revolution in this genre. Actually, as a person who usually writes about different subjects, I had never ever thought about this kind of relationship. A relationship between two teenagers whom both suffer from cancer and in a way are strange. Not only the idea of this story is something pure but also the words which writer's used to communicate better with readers are among the best ones. anyway, accept my apology because we are here not for the book's review but because of the movie's one. Like all the reviews I have here on IMDb, screenplay is the first item in which I'm interested to talk to you about it. As you know when you want to make a movie out of a successful novel or story which has acclaimed critical praises without any pictures, you have a hard job to do not only because of this fact that you are not able to change everything you want but also because of this fact that maybe changing words affects reader's mind. Here the writers could've done their job in its best way. Just follow these four simple steps and then you will find out why I'm telling you this. 1-Open The Book 2-Read It 3-Watch The Movie 4-Review The Book , and you feel that you've seen all the things you expected without any deficiencies. That's exactly the reason I know this title as an important movie. Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber have done their best. About the casts, I searched, but couldn't find anyone better than Shailene Woodley as Hazel and Ansel Elgort as Gus. We've seen them before in the Divergent but here they show how good they are. Two things would be enough to prove their abilities; The way Ansel Elgort tries to communicate with all audiences and his co star by his body language and without any dialogue and sometimes just by staring into Hazel's eyes which shows that he has overwhelmed by his role and his character and the way Hazel tries to convince you she is in love with Gus. So, they've done their job perfectly. Actually, I've become one of their fans since I watched this movie and their amazing collaboration with each other. As a conclusion, I prefer to write about the best scene of the movie, based on my own opinion. I think the scene that Gus asked Hazel to write him a funeral speech and asked her to read it in front of him, while he was alive and was there in his own funeral ceremony, was the best scene. The way they became sad, the way they became happy by reviewing their memories and etc. all together would be enough to convince you how memorable this scene is. I think if you are interested in romance movies you should watch this movie. Believe me! it's a good one. Best Regards, Amin Ghanbari",8.0,AminGhanbari,2015/07/08,10,8

Unbelievable at times, yet still so likeable. I still love this classic to this very day, as much as I did when I was a teenager.

1838,Primal Fear,Shamefully underrated,"I saw Primal Fear in 2000 when I was 16 or so, it was on the telly and I was about to go reading in my room and saying good night to my parents when I saw the face of Ed Norton on telly. I had just seen Fight Club at the theater the night before and had been extremely impressed by his work, though I didn't even knew who he was back then. I decided to watch the whole movie, just because he was in and boy did I enjoy it! Not only for his performance (I'll go back to that later), but firstly because of the court game. I really liked to see the mechanisms of how the defense and the prosecution play, the tricks, twists and turns between Mr Gere and Mrs Linley were great to see. As for their acting, I couldn't really tell how good it was, since I first watched it dubbed (I'm French). Now, even dubbed, Edward Norton's performance just blew me away. The change in his look, from stupid to downright scary, his whole body language, all of this was just mind-blowing, particularly considering that it was his first job. I have reviewed it in Original Version since and enjoyed the other actors work far better. My only complaint is that, considering how the film was shot, it now looks ""old"" and a bit aged, with a direction that seems a little flat. However, the movie still has one of my favorite twist endings (Usual Suspects still ranking #1 in my book).",,melgarcia40,2011/07/19,2,2
1839,Horrible Bosses 2,"Most of the time Horrible Bosses 2 is quite boring, it doesn't bring anything new to the table and it feels lazy","HORRIBLE BOSSES 2 review by Mike Smith The boys are back! Dale, Kurt and Nick decide to start their own business but things don't go as planned after a slick investor really screws them over. I was a fan of the first Horrible Bosses film but Horrible Bosses 2 is a good example that not every good movie needs a sequel. The writing feels lazy and rushed; I found myself chuckling but I was hoping to have more big laughs like in the first movie. The cast is made up of amazing actors: Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikis and Charlie Day have a fun chemistry together but for some reason this movie didn't harness it, which hurts the film. I love Jennifer Aniston's character but this time they toned her down when they really should of amped her up. Kevin Spacey also returns and the scenes with him are worth watching and as always he steals the show. Christoph Waltz is a new addition to this movie; I'm a big fan of Waltz but just like the rest of the characters in this film his is two dimensional. The director Sean Anders did a grate job with the car case by using the right mix for action and comedy. As for the rest of the movie, he really depends on montages which should really only be used occasionally in a movie. Most of the time Horrible Bosses 2 is quite boring, it doesn't bring anything new to the table and it feels lazy. The movie has an awesome cast but feels like they don't push the actors to their full potential which is most likely because of the mediocre writing.

1840,Goodfellas,interesting but deeply flawed,"Spoiler i dont really understand what all the fuss is over this film. yes, it is very good. but top 50 of all time good? oscar worthy good? no, i'd have to say no. while the first half is incredibly impressive, beautifully put together with wonderful acting. the second half starts to fall apart. the acting was very good, but impressive? outstanding? no, it didnt appear that any of these actors were actually pushing themselves or doing anything particulary fantastic with the exception of one or two scenes. my main problem with the film was the script. as i said, the first half was very impressive, but the last half just disintergrates. we barely find out anything about the wife after they get married. we dont even found out how deeply involved she is in the drug dealing or whether she knows about sandy. it is only at the last minute that we find out that she is on drugs as well. it is never really made clear why paulie is on trial at the end and there are numerous other plot holes which left me feeling cheated. it felt as if i was told part of the story and then the rest was just brushed over and forgotten. a great shame considering the brilliance of the first half.",7.0,dispet,2003/08/19,15,8
1841,Hotel Transylvania,"Family Friendly, Festive and Fun!","There are very few movies anymore that are truly kid friendly, but i truly enjoyed this one! The best part is it has nice messages for both kids and parents. My boys loved the whole monster theme. I personally would wait till a child is 8 or 9 before letting them see it only in case they may fear goofy monsters and voices. It was nice as an adult to have some unexpected clean laughs. The many generational perspectives, and even in an odd way, cultural perspectives can make this an easy film for a broad range of ages to enjoy, from 8 to 70 years. I also enjoyed hearing good old stars like Kevin James, Adam Sandler, and Fran Dresher as the voices. As an 80's teenager i have a natural respect for these actors, actresses, and ""90's feel"" films. I did not see it in 3D, but based on the animation i just saw, i am sure it would even be better in 3d. So this would be a fabulous film to add to the October/Halloween festivities. It really put us into the spirit of fun and laughs.",9.0,kab6609,2012/10/09,6,4
1842,Goodfellas,The best mobster film ever made,"After you see this movie, all other mobster movies you see or ever have seen will seem like garbage. They and their cast of characters will all appear cartoonish in comparison. Of course, this is a movie about the mafia from the working man/gangster point of view, where ""The Godfather"" was a mafia movie filmed from the viewpoint of the executive suite, so there really is no valid comparison there. ""Goodfellas"" really does seem ahead of its time when you realize that the only artistic work about the mafia that compares to it in quality is the HBO series ""The Sopranos"", which debuted nine years after this movie was made. ""Goodfellas"" tells the real-life story of mobster Henry Hill, and it is largely true, although there are individual scenes that are out of sequence and others that were added for dramatic effect, such as Karen Hill flushing the cocaine down the toilet during the drug bust. Also, Tommy, the character that Joe Pesci played and the part for which he won an Oscar, was actually a composite of two separate gangsters. Other details are omitted completely, probably because they would have spun the movie off in too many different directions. For example, crime boss ""Big Paulie"" actually was having an affair with Henry Hill's wife, Karen. When Tommy tried to rape her and Paulie found out, that was when he alerted the Gambinos to the fact that Tommy had killed their missing crew member, ""made man"" Billy Batts, nine years earlier. This is the true reason that it took so long for Tommy to be killed over that incident. Thus, masterful direction of the story by Martin Scorsese in what was probably his finest film is why the audience has a more cohesive view of the mobsters portrayed in this movie than if we had been told every last detail. What really makes this movie great is all of the personal details that enable you to see these mobsters living a largely suburban life, concerned about kids' birthday parties and getting the sauce just right for dinner, and all the while completely immersed in a completely amoral lifestyle in which murder and bribes solve everything- a lifestyle to which they would never voluntarily choose an alternative.",10.0,AlsExGal,2009/11/18,67,55
1843,Taxi Driver,Diary of a madman,"The script of ""Taxi Driver"" is built like a diary, the diary of a very ordinary guy who gets hired as a night taxi driver back from Vietnam, because he can't sleep at night. A very ordinary guy who tries to break his isolation, but can't, while violence accumulates inside him. One of those unnoticed people with dark things on their mind, one of those who break up the news one day with some extraordinary outburst of rage, to fall back immediately into anonymity. The gradual transformation of man into beast in this movie is chilling. It's still funny and pathetic when the hero threatens himself in front of the mirror (""you're talking to me?""), but when he comes out with a mohawk hairdo and dark glasses, it is obvious that nasty stuff is going to take place. As in ""A Clockwork Orange"", violence is recuperated by society depending on what purpose it is used for. Whereas he was about to murder the candidate for presidency, ""god's lonely man"" fails and instead kills a vicious pimp who exploits teenage prostitutes. The potential criminal becomes a hero for a day. Such stories happen everywhere of course, but it seems that the bewildering atmosphere of New York City's summer night was the best choice. ""Taxi Driver"" gives us a very realistic approach of New York, in a way that is not seen on screen so often, at least not anymore, whilst that city is probably the one in the world that has been filmed the biggest number of times. Most of the movie takes place at night. The credits open on the blazing lights of the yellow taxi cab moving slowly in the dark rainy streets. A kaleidoscope of neonlight appears through the dripping windows as the driver's eyes blink in the front mirror. The night is the hero's universe, it's the time when ""all the animals come out"", as he says. By contrast, the few daylight scenes look somewhat off-key, but this was definitely intentional. The final scene still appears today as extremely violent, but at least, it shows murder for what it is. Brutal, ugly, crude. It is something one tends to forget about after seeing so many police series where people get shot so often that it gets casual. Real violence is not casual when you face it, and here is a film that makes you face it. The directing is first class and deservedly made path for Scorsese as a world renowned artist. Some techniques he used here are unusual for American cinema, like focusing on details for a few seconds. The movie is enhanced by an excellent music soundtrack by jazz composer Bernard Herrman who died before the picture was even released. Two of the actors also deservedly made it to stardom. Robert de Niro plays a very unglamorous character, but his presence on screen is so intense that it's no wonder it made such an impression. As for Jodie Foster, she already appeared in films as a child, but playing a teenage prostitute was certainly not an easy challenge, and probably it was that role that really turned her into a major actress. ""Taxi Driver"" was a big hit when it came out, both for the public and the critics. It won the Palme d'Or in Cannes, and served as a trend setter for many later films, like for instance Quentin Tarantino's and Abel Ferrara's. But even today, the original model seems difficult to emulate, probably because achieving a masterpiece is a rare thing, by definition.",10.0,francheval,2006/02/13,363,308

1845,The Wailing,Look at my hands and my feet. It is i myself!,"This won't be a helpful review. Maybe that's the best way to help you out. Don't watch the trailers, read reviews or any articles that gives you the slightest idea of this film. Hey, i know you're here to find out more about this movie but stop. Just stop. Do yourself a favour, stop reading and just find a cinema with 'The Wailing,' experience it then look into it deeply. Please don't throw this off with a 'Oh well, i guess it had some creepy visuals.' PLEASE DON'T. Have repeated viewings, discuss with friends, study it, the director's motive, the symbolism, the message, dive deep into its world, it's so worth it. This film is soaked in the macabre, and it's fascinating to drain out its beauty during and after the credits roll. Thank you Hong-jin Na and everyone involved. I walked in to this blind and wow, i wasn't in a cinema that night, but in a roller-coaster. What a wild experience. For me, the real horror and what makes this a masterpiece wasn't found in the film's aesthetic, but in it's terrifyingly contemporary and relevant ideas. This film is really about everyone sitting in the theater. But, i'm not going to tell you what it is, that's doing this film a disservice. That's for you to find out and for you to agree or disagree with what the film is saying. Remember, this isn't a helpful review.. Hurry to your cinema, feast on 'The Wailing'.

1846,Moon,"Dull, lame, predictable...","Sam Bell is stationed on the moon as the sole operator of a vast mining expedition. After a 3 year period of working, Sam starts to suffer from delusions and general physical impediment. He crashes his mining cart rendering him unconscious. When he regains consciousness and finds his way back to the base, another Sam bell seems to have taken his place. The movie is reasonably well produced but didn't offer an iota of original or interesting writing. The idea that somewhere along the way a person finds out that he's a clone, a hologram or a machine is so incredibly mundane in the realm of SF, that you cannot base an entire movie on just that. In fact, we need an abundance of additional story line to steer our thoughts clear from the unavoidable silliness this kind of space based story will ultimately confront the viewer with. Silliness that could have been avoided in this case, had it been playing out on for example Antarctica. The fact that it takes place on the Moon adds absolutely nothing to the story. Imagine the film The Matrix plodding on for 80 minutes with Neo having endless discussions with himself behind his PC and then, 20 minutes before the end, have the film reveal that he's actually in the Matrix, having him eat the pill, do a quick voice-over and end the movie right there. That's what the makers of Moon would have done with it. 2/10",1.0,evycomelately,2011/02/09,176,80
1847,Detachment,An unnerving yet brilliant account of the education system and its teachers,"As classroom dramas go this may well be one the finest I have ever seen. A compelling insight into Americas failing education system and the beleaguered teachers that inhabit it. The story centres around Henry Barthes, a substitute teacher who spends three weeks at a high school where the students are as troubled as their teachers. Barthes, portrayed brilliantly by Adrien Brody, finds himself surrounded by individuals who have become jaded to the point of breaking. His tale becomes even more complex when a chance encounter with a teenage prostitute, Erica, develops into an unconventional friendship. It's within this custodial dynamic that we see some of the films most poignant and heartbreaking moments, as well as some outstanding acting from Sami Gayle, who plays the vulnerable young girl that society has abandoned. The film employs a three part cutaway technique with Henry Barthes providing a narrative in the form an interview, as well as flashbacks to his childhood - which allows us an insight into why he such a brooding and melancholic character. The flashbacks are often juxtaposed with scenes involving Barthes grandfather with whom he visits in hospital through out the film. The third cutaway is an animated chalkboard sequence which I felt conveyed a sense of culpability and lost innocence. The film also boasts an extraordinary supporting cast; including James Caan, Marcia Gay Harden and a very brief appearance from Bryan Cranston, as well as a surprisingly fine turn from Lucy Liu- the schools doctor. The staffs sense of disillusionment and frustration, due to the students perpetual indifference to their own fate, is vented brilliantly by Liu in a scene that begs the question; ""where, and when, did it all go wrong?"" Though dealing with very bleak subjects and despite the characters ceaseless sense of defeat and abject loathing for their profession, there are still some heart warming moments in the film. And though it offers no suggestion as to how we can amend such failings in our education system, and that parenting has in so many avenues of society become bereft of any moral guidance and adequacy, it still left me reassured that there are those who are still prepared to undertake such a daunting and thankless task. If you're looking for an entertaining piece then I suggest you look elsewhere, but if you wish to see a brilliantly thought provoking film that raises more questions than it provides answers, and you're prepared for some uncomfortable moments, then you'll be rewarded with a film that is excellently written and directed and has some outstanding performances. A great film!",9.0,leereddy,2012/05/04,16,15
1848,Detachment,Mandatory viewing,"This film should be mandatory viewing for any child, parent and educator. The chest crushing weight of expectation, oppression and the 24/7 bombardment of how we should look, behave and conform is outlined brilliantly in this movie. Clearly showing on all sides that which is not understood from differing factions. Adrian Brody is yet again, excellent and really is an underrated actor. This is the 2nd film of his I have seen this month and in both (Manhattan Night) he captures the mood better than any other actor I can think of. These are my kind of films, dark, compelling and the characters absorbing and interesting. The highest praise I can give this is that it would sit well with any European cinematic effort.",9.0,kevandeb,2017/01/05,4,3
1849,Taxi Driver,HUH?,"A film like 'Taxi Driver' makes me wonder whether, perhaps, it's just my fault, not being able to appreciate ""great"" cinema. 'Taxi Driver' is, unarguably, one of the most highly regarded works ever committed to celluloid, and many claim that the chance to essay the character of Travis Bickle, the tormented protagonist of the tale, is every actor's 'wet dream'. Travis Bickle, unquestionably, is unforgettably portrayed by a De Niro at the very top of his form. Every move is measured, nuanced, and honed to perfection. As a performance, it is a tour de force. No questions about that. But what about the film itself? I read both the reviews, of this film, by the highly regarded and universally respected Roger Ebert, who, clearly, is overawed by it, as he is by Scorcese himself. Myself, I came out of the experience with a ""Was THAT it?"" feeling. Internet reviews of the film had raised my expectations so high that, at the end of it all, I felt as if someone had hit me with a wet sock. Ebert, in one of his reviews, meditates considerably on the ending of the film, which, he wonders, might be a dream, and partook more of the character of ""music"" than of ""drama"". To me, it seemed nothing of the kind. To me, the film appeared to be a straightforward story of a vigilante, who - to avoid straying into spoiler territory - achieves something honourable, and is lauded for it. I found nothing dreamlike about it, and, with all due respect, felt that the film ended on a note which was disappointingly flat. I do not intend to expound on the story of the film, which is straightforward, and would be well known to net surfers, having been discussed ad nauseam an interminable number of times. The Wikipedia introduction to the plot of the film, though, I felt was misleading. It claims the film to be the story of Bickle's ""descent into insanity"". To me, it seems nothing of the kind. Bickle appears just as sane, at the close of the story, as he was at its start. Apart from De Niro's performance, which invited the four stars I have, somewhat hesitatingly, awarded this film, I found nothing really to right home about. Sure, Jodie Foster, at twelve and a half, is cute as a button, but she really has nothing much to do. And I also feel that the wonderful Harvey Keitel, who stays on screen for exactly two scenes, is sadly wasted. All in all, a disappointment. Or is it, perhaps, that I just do not appreciate great cinema? Maybe. Who knows?",4.0,charishankar,2020/03/25,15,9
1850,Spider-Man 2,What a movie!,"This is probably the best ""Spider-Man"" movie I've ever seen! Sam Raimi, once again, does a great job with this one. Alfred Molina was great as the sinister Doc Ock. I especially like the dramatic side of the film, such as Aunt May being in debt, Peter Parker thinking about giving up the life of a super-hero, and his friendship with Mary Jane (despite the fact that he really loves her) beginning to degenerate. I also like how Harry is beginning to become more arrogant and more bent on killing Spider-Man for ""killing"" his father. I didn't quite know what to expect of this one when I first saw it in theaters (and I had just started recovering from a mild case of the chicken pox when I did), but I was completely taken-aback from this.

(although i had never seen ludicrous act, and he's good, and i am sure is going to be a big star!). watch it if you are curious about the hype, but don't get trapped by this movie that tries it's hardest to make you feel like you HAVE to like it or you are supporting racism. there may be some truths in this movie, and some thoughts provoked etc, but through most of the movie i felt a palpable sense of manipulation that removed any serious meaning it could have had for me.",1.0,bnjmn99,2006/01/15,32,20
1852,Interstellar,You will love it or hate it,"OK, I've just seen Interstellar and I can tell it's one of those movies that you either love or hate. Personally I loved it and probably I'm going to watch it again to process it a little bit more. It's not a simple movie, maybe that was already clear, is a Nolan's film. Matthew McConaughey does a great job by portraying Cooper. The most touching scenes are those between his character and Mackenzie Foy, who plays the younger version of Murph, Jessica Chastain character. Either it seems to be an ""Outer Space Film"" is more about human relations and how important is for us to be linked with others. Even it's a long movie, 169 minutes, I didn't felt it that long or tedious. The director managed to keep us engaged through the whole film. The experience on IMAX in 70mm film. The image quality perceived was superb, now I get why Christopher Nolan and other directors are fighting to keep film alive. I had the opportunity to watch it at the Chinese theatre and was a great experience, my first time in that theatre. The staff from the theatre even told us that Nolan himself watched several scenes of the movie in that theatre to ""calibrate"" the experience. Which is very cool. Well, I encourage you to go and watch Interstellar to see of you love or hate it.",10.0,Robert_Escamilla,2014/11/05,245,132
1853,The Green Mile,A rare gem,"Tom Hanks, in my opinion, gave the performance of his career by bringing emotion and depth to his part. The only actor that bettered him was Michael Clarke Duncan. How he made this giant like character into a vulnerable pussycat was a marvel. On whole, the cast came together and gave the best performance I have seen in a movie for a long time. Not one of them let the side down by being weak. David Morse who is more known for his supporting roles was also excellent and hopefully not long till he's carrying his own movie. The Green Mile isn't a movie about hope and friendship, as The Shawshank Redemption was, it is a movie about a miracle of a man, and the people he affects.",9.0,Rockford_6,2008/08/19,14,10
1854,October Sky,Reason that the movie is named October Sky,"I think I read this someplace: Joe Johnston (director of the film and also one of the guys who founded Industrial Light and Magic for work on the first Star Wars film) and one of his producers or something were racking their brains for a title for the movie, ""Rocket Boys"" (I guess) was lacking something. One day they were messing with a PC program that forms words from other words (ie: you type in a word or series of words and it mixes the letters up and forms other words) I think the technical term is an ""anagram"" Anyway, they typed in ""Rocket Boys"" and sure enough what comes back is ""October Sky"". They were shocked to say the least. The title summed up everything in the movie since the movie revolves around Sputnik.

It bores the hell out of me,its not moody,its not arty,is not beautiful desolation its just mind numbing. A unbelievably straight forward story masquerading as deep and meaningful with lots to say on the human condition.The only thing it says is the people behind this have never read a science fiction book in there lives and don't know how to make a good film.

1858,Pulp Fiction,Tribute to On the Waterfront,"I have read some of the comments on this website concerning Pulp Fiction and perhaps I missed it but no one has mentioned the fact that Tarantino used an element from Elia Kazan's ""On the Waterfront"" in 1954 staring Marlon Brando. In Pulp Fiction, Marsellus Wallace told Bruce Willis that he is supposed to intentionally lose to a boxer named Wilson: Marsellus: ""In the fifth, your ass goes down. Say it."" Butch: ""In the fifth, my ass goes down."" Bruce Willis, not only doesn't go down and lose the fight, he kills Wilson. When I saw this, I became flushed with movie deja vu and felt very satisfied. Why was the boxer called Wilson? In ""On the Waterfront"" Marlon Brando has a famous monologue in which he expains how his boxing career ended: He went down intentionally against a boxer named Wilson because of greedy mobsters. Wilson, therefore was the invisble antagonist against Marlon Brando. Tarantino, being a smart guy, knew that in the deep annals of the film buff world, he could redeem Marlon Brando and all us film buffs that hate Wilson more than anything by killing Wilson. If it wasn't for Wilson, Marlon Brando ""coulda been a contender."" So, by killing Wilson forty years later, Tarantino effectively killed off the jerk that ruined Brando's Boxing career in ""On the Waterfront."" I don't know if many people had already realized this but I thought I would bring up to people's attention. Also, for Tarantino fans, watch ""Kiss Me Deadly"" (1955) by Robert Aldrich. It has the answer to why the contents of the briefcase, when opened by Travolta, give a glowing lightbeam on Travolta's face and we never see what's inside.",,blue_camals,2002/10/06,11,7

Its starting point is a character who is detached and lives a peripatetic life in an almost clutter free apartment. The film explores the character and his motivations and those of the other school teachers at a failing school.I found the film engrossing as the realistic messy lifestyles it documented developed depth through the 97 minutes. Statements were made, bubbles burst and hidden secrets revealed. It is gripping too, how will it end, will the lives and problems all be sorted? No signposts just a gripping story.

As the picture progresses you wonder just how Spider Man will eventually put an end to his octopus friend and his evil deeds. There are many exciting scenes and especially when Spider Man is trying to save a run-away elevated train from going off its track and winding up in a river.

Perhaps the movie works too hard and too long to use one more Kleenex. How many ""eulogy"" scenes does one character need? Good thing Hazel or Gus didn't have a dog or it wouldn't have made it through the movie. The performances are easier to watch then the subject matter. The young leads will be mentioned in Golden Globe circles. Laura Dern, the second best actor in her family gets better with age. William Dafoe can't be as bad as written. His one sour note performance and implausible popping in as the mail man felt contrived. A good score and use of the Amsterdam locations lift spirits.

1863,Taxi Driver,Very good but flawed,"Great atmosphere and remarkable performances from DeNiro, Foster and even Albert Brooks but this film is sloppy with too many loose ends. Never really explained or expanded upon is the underlying friction between Travis and African Americans in the film...his suspicious, trance-like staredowns with black characters are never developed. The ending is completely out of place and unbelievable...Travis initiated the shootings...he never would have been hailed as a vigilante hero and in the real world would have been tried for murder. Deeply disturbed protagonist gets the girl in the end???? Come on. What's that all about. Also never fully explained is why does Palentine become the target of his lonely obsession with making a mark in this world? Travis had always expressed the desire to clean up the scum...and I understand the symbolic linking of a pimp with a politician, but the association is sloppy in the film because Travis always admired Palantine even after his disaster date with Betsy. There was never a turning point or event for him where the candidate became the target of his social dissatisfaction. And then there's the subject of Travis' hair. I know it seems petty but it was very distracting seeing scenes that were obviously shot as soon as the shaved headed DeNiro's hair grew in barely enough to pass for continuity with the earlier scenes. In all, I like this film. I think it's powerful and disturbing but it is not an icon or masterpiece.

1864,Taxi Driver,Maybe Scorsese's best?,"Here's a test for telling if a film has a great atmosphere: if you find yourself wanting to do the things you see the main character doing because it all just looks and sounds so cool, then it most likely does. And man do I want to go straight to New York right now and soak in the night atmosphere of a big city, drive strangers around while never knowing why they're going to where I'm taking them, and maybe try to assassinate a certain presidential candidate. And I don't even have a driver's license. But seriously, this is another one of those classics I'd never seen before, and believe it or not, somehow I didn't even know about the whole presidential candidate side plot and just happened to watch this on election day. Weird coincidences aside, I bloody loved this. It's by far my favourite Scorsese film I've seen so far, and almost entirely because of Travis and how perfect Robert De Niro is in this role. I'm not sure I've ever felt such moral confusion on a character in my life. I think he's a product of toxic masculinity and that confronting Betsy was pretty disgusting...but then who hasn't been on a date that ended badly for no reason you can see? And how angry did it make you? Similarly, who hasn't seen some kind of injustice at any level and felt that desire, even if only for a bit, to dispense justice yourself, even if you know you'd never really do it? And I'm sure whatever side you're on, you can relate to the desire to assassinate a presidential candidate right now (make it the orange one if you're going to do it anyway though). And I really can't overstate enough how amazing Robert De Niro is in this, everyone else is great too, but he is in some of the best performances of all time tier. But that atmosphere though...this is one of the best cityscape films I've ever seen. The soundtrack, the lighting, and the set design are all incredible, and the directing and cinematography is by far the best I've seen from Scorsese (although that is only including Raging Bull, The Irishman and The Wolf Of Wall Street so take that with a pinch of salt.) And if (God willing) Biden is sworn in two and a half months from now, if I've somehow attracted any crazy right wing nutters to my account, then I couldn't recommend a better film for your frustrations, or as a means of damage control.",10.0,TheCorniestLemur,2020/11/06,6,6
1865,Taxi Driver,Psychological Breakdown is Better in Theory Than in Practice,"TAXI DRIVER tells the dramatic tale of Travis Bickle. He is a cab driver, who is haunted by disturbing images of New York City's dark undersides of crime, confusion, prostitution, and corruption. As Travis tries to integrate into the sleazy undertones of the city, he becomes obsessed by the environments around him. He is eventually driven to madness by urban decay. The fast pace and disarray of New York is brilliantly demonstrated in this film. Travis, in search of anything that he can bond with, is forced into picking up prostitutes, often with very sad and bitter results. Various events, such as these, drive him further and further to the breaking point. Great cinematography and acting however are compromised by an often very boring storyline where the viewer can not develop any type of connection to the other characters. Other than Travis, supporting actors seem to exist only in reactionary roles to show how the pain of the underworld effects him. I was turned off as well by Travis' first person narratives. His ""diaries"" were no longer interesting after the first several entries and became monotonous. Travis doesn't really DO anything in terms of action sequences until near the end of the film. However, by this time, I was bored because I wanted something to happen on screen. TAXI DRIVER, can at times convey powerful psychological FEELINGS of HOW someone may respond to urban madness. But there is not enough action in the story to maintain interest throughout the film. Most viewers will know what is going to happen before it happens. You will also spend a great deal of time just waiting for something to happen. TAXI DRIVER is similar to looking at a mental health practitioner's notes on a patient who paints a road map that the person may be disturbed. It than tries to go inside the mind of the disturbed patient and the viewer is supposed to be incredibly absorbed into what he/she is thinking. But if you know the person or the similar situations presented by him/her in their own life, the practitioner's notes just reinforce what is already known. Instead of surprises or strong action sequences, which TAXI DRIVER should have been, the viewers get a psychological road map of New York and its undertones as portrayed in Travis' mind with a predictable conclusion. This results in an OK film, but nowhere near what it could have been. Taxi Driver is overrated.",6.0,jbartelone,2007/12/26,13,7
1866,Blackfish,Behind the scene at Sea World,"Gabriella Cowperthwaite's unsettling yet compelling documentary, Blackfish, is not about your average visit to Sea World. This breathtaking, jaw dropping film gives disturbing ""behind the scene"" knowledge about the most famous Sea World we would've never known about. ""This is a multi-billion- dollar corporation that makes its money through the exploitation of orcas"" says Dr. Jeffrey Ventre. The dispute of Sea World was that it was never the fault of the whales but more so the fault of the trainer because of timing or ""trainer errors"". Knowing their wrongfulness proves why they denied to be interviewed throughout the documentary. Tilikum, a killer whale, weighing well over 12,000 pounds is the star of this documentary. Research shows that dolphins and whales have a profound instinct, awareness, intelligence and are amazingly friendly. Disturbing videos and accident reports from previous performances show a different side of Tilikum. Research also shows whales taken out of their natural habitat and placed in captivity are ""ticking time-bombs"". Originally Tilikum was only supposed to be used for breeding purposes but they found it in their need to use him for more. ""Rule number one is you certainly would not breed an animal that has showed a history of aggression towards human"" says Sam Berg, a former trainer from Sea World. Numerous incidents occurred when trainers were attacked or killed by Tilikum, but Sea World continued to require him to be trained and perform. Sea World's visitors look forward to seeing the performances unaware of the danger the trainers go through daily and the inhumane treatments towards the whales. Inhumane treatment consisted of no stimulation in the man-made box where the orcas lived for years, being deprived of food and skin raked when not following commands. This inhumane treatment is why whales lash out, become agitated, and trigger psychosis. Psychosis is what led Tilikum to lash out on one of his trainers who died during a performance which caused Sea Land to close. ""I been expecting somebody to be killed by Tilikum, I'm surprised it took as long as it did."" Former trainers were interviewed and talked about not being informed of past incidents. These trainers stated that showing videos and educating new trainers of the past incidents would be helpful as opposed to keeping quiet. There are many disturbing scenes in the documentary that bring the film together as a whole. One of the scenes forces the viewers to acknowledge the oppression of the orca and how being in captivity emotionally effects them. The scene portrays a major death which ties to the instability of the orcas. It's essential to the overall theme of the film. An employee of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) reported that swimming with orcas is dangerous and unpredictable. They recommended physical barriers that separated the trainer and the orcas due to the dangers of being in close proximity. An OSHA expert witness recognized the deaths were not the trainer fault, as Sea World's public relations reported, but due to the agitation of the orcas. Sea World administration blamed the incidents on trainer errors and timing issues. Black Fish is a very informational and entertaining film that captures the core identities of killer whales in captivation. From the emotional capture of the whales to the disturbing attacks they perform out of the daily irritation of inhumane treatments. ""There's no record of any orca doing any harm to humans IN THE WILD"" says another former trainer. The tone that this documentary is trying to portray is somewhat sympathetic and sorrowful but seems to enlighten the world on the affects of taking the orcas out of their natural habitat in the ocean where they swam freely.",10.0,destineetaylor22,2015/10/20,3,3
1867,Primal Fear,Meet Edward Norton,"Outstanding thriller on par with ""The Usual Suspects"", ""Primal Fear"" is an impressive film about one lawyer's (Richard Gere) yearning for the spotlight. He gets his wish after an archbishop is brutally murdered in Chicago. It appears that choir boy Edward Norton (in his first film, Oscar-nominated) is the killer, but there is more to this case than meets the eye. In the end, Gere is going to learn that what he thinks he wants (fame and fortune) is not all that great because of what he has had to go through to get there. ""Primal Fear"" was one of the more interesting films of 1996, but was ignored by almost everyone. Richard Gere does some of his best work ever. Laura Linney, John Mahoney, Alfre Woodard, and Frances McDormand are all good in supporting roles. However, it is Edward Norton who proved to be the discovery of the 1990s. He keeps the audience on their toes and he adds depth and emotion to a film that would have looked much different if he had not been in it. 4.5 out of 5 stars.",,tfrizzell,2000/11/25,190,175
1868,Goodfellas,It's the real thing.,"This film is a instant classic. It documents the life of Henry Hill and how he got into being part of the Mob. The amazing thing is that it's no fiction, even if it was, it's still beautiful. It's based on a book called Wiseguy written by Nicholas Pileggi. He met the real Henry Hill and made his story into a best selling book. Scorsese worked with Pileggi after liking the fast pace of the book, and they wrote the script. It was developed into this film. Casting is another great thing about the film, it seems that all the actors fit perfectly in their roles. It also has some really funny bits. Pileggi worked with Scorsese on another great Mob film, Casino.",10.0,fayruzi,1998/09/07,24,13
1869,Goodfellas,Inside The mob,"Meet Henry Hill (Ray Liotta). He grew up in a marginal neighborhood on the Brooklyn - Queens line near JFK Airport. The neighborhood is working class but colonized by the mob. Local boss Paul ""Paulie"" Cicero (Paul Sorvino) superintends the neighborhood like a feudal lord. Paul Sevino carries the part of a low level mob boss with grace and dignity persuasively Italian without indulging in stereotypes. Though not eligible for induction into the ritual laden Italian Mafia, Henry Hill and his occasional co-conspirators Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) are allowed to hang onto the fringe of the high life of organized crime. Joe Pesci indulges more of the stereotypical Italian gangster: ruthless and earthy somewhat lacking in the class Servino brings to that role. Even though Pesci leans on certain stereotypes he manages to make a joke out of them. ""Imagine,"" Tommy Devito frankly observes, ""prejudice against Italians in this day and age."" But be careful not to laugh too hard with Tommy. He guns down a made Mafioso for indulging in fun at Tommy's expense. Tommy Devito, Jimmy Conway and Henry Hill may not be formally inducted Mafioso. They're called wise guys or goodfellas. While they're not official member of the Italian mob, they are involved in some of the major mob operations such as truck-jacking and airport heists including both the Air France and Luftansa raid. There are others at the extreme periphery of the mob including Morris 'Morrie' Kessler (Chuck Low) who furnishes comic relief right up to the point calculating Jimmy Conway decides to rub Kessler out rather than pay Kessler his share of the Luftansa heist. But money is not the sole object of the wise guys. Heck they blow it all on the track. It's the life. Declares Henry Hill, ""we're movie stars with muscle! Real life Italian - American Ray Liotta plays Henry Hill, the product of s strict Irish father and a saintly Italian mother well. Unlike his running buddy Tommy Devito, Henry has a certain charm he carries in the twinkling of blue eyes. He's one more likely to use persuasion than muscle when that's possible, but he's ready to administer a beating when that's required. As long as wise guys kick money upstairs to Uncle Paulie, life can be beautiful. There are certain bounds: No Drugs and the penalty is the ultimate one for violating this rule. Will the temptation to make the big money selling drugs bring the high life of the wise guys down?",8.0,deanofrpps,2007/07/29,7,4
1870,The Green Mile,"Rest In Peace, Michael Clarke Duncan, you legend.","With this movie Tom Hanks proves why he is one of the all time best male actors that shook the world with their abnormal amazing acting roles. Among the TOP 100 IMDB rated movies, he has probably more than 4-5, including The Green Mile, Forest Gump and Saving Private Ryan, Captain Philips was also an amazing movie. But the spotlight in The Green Mile is reserved for Michael Clarke Duncan in the role of John Coffey. Nobody can count the amount of people that this person made cry in the early 2000's. He is the most adoring male human being that showed up on the movie screen in this century, his acting is out of this world and emotions are leaking out of every cell of his body. The fact that the actor died 7 years ago makes everyone 10 times more sad....rest in piece legend.

This is definitely not one of those comedies which tries a lot to hit the audience. Movie felt all natural and not only me but entire theater was laughing out loud till the end.

1872,Spider-Man 2,Is it any wonder he's stilled billed as 'amazing'?,"When I heard a sequel was being made to the original Spider-Man movie, I admit that I had my doubts as to whether it could be pulled off. Sure, Raimi and co. did a great job with the first movie, creating not only a faithful comic book adaptation, but a great movie in its own right, but the usual 'sequel issue' looms into view: a well done and successful movie is made, but then the sequel is rushed out a year or two later which turns out to be less than successful, and the entire series is remembered on a bad note. I liked the idea of a Spider-Man 2, but I didn't want it to ruin the memory of the original. Turns out I had nothing to worry about at all. Raimi bestows upon us a masterpiece, easily equaling if not surpassing the first in quality and enjoyability. Unlike most sequels, which turn out with a very shabby plot, attempted to be covered up by stuffing in as much action as they possibly can, we actually spend more time with Peter Parker out of costume than behind the mask of Spider-Man. These long sequences spent with Peter Parker's friends and family as he struggles to solve his various personal problems risk losing our attention, but fortunately, Spider-Man will rush out to beat on some criminals at just the right moment to keep us interested. Raimi himself uses the directorial freedom granted by a sequel to allow his quirky sense of humour to permeate the film much more visibly than in the first movie. He uses techniques such as having the scene go entirely black except for the eye of Spider-Man's costume as a scene transition, or having the camera perform a dissolve effect, representing Doc Ock's progressing insanity. Such liberties you can't usually get away with in a movie, but Raimi finds a way to make them work. However, the main problem I had with Spider-Man 2 is that the 'slow scenes' drag on far too long. Far too much time is devoted to nothing but Peter Parker walking along the street, or running with a determined look on his face, without even any dialogue. I think these parts should have been edited down to about a quarter of their length, to decrease the likelihood of them appearing boring, unnecessary and out of place. The visual effects are much improved - Spidey looks and moves better than ever! And the addition of Dr Octopus and his four metal tentacles to the script gives the FX people plenty to play around with. The tentacles were apparently part puppetry and part CGI, but however they did it, the tentacles looked and acted excellent. This also opened up an opportunity for much more intense fight scenes than in the first movie, with Doc Ock and Spidey crawling up and down the walls, bashing at each other all the while. Unlike the Batman series, which threw in new actors every time, destroying any sense of continuity, all the principal actors from the first film return to play their characters once more. As the man behind the mask (for part of the time anyway) Tobey Maguire gives another solid performance. (in spite of what British Tabloids have to say about him out of character) He offers a lot more insight into the character of Peter Parker, and the motives that drive him. Kirsten Dunst gives a decent performance as Mary-Jane Watson, but she seems bored in her role, as if she would rather be just about anywhere else at the time, which doesn't help us realize what it is about her that makes Peter love her so. J.K. Simmons, however, gives another enthusiastic performance as the wonderfully horrible J. Jonah Jameson, number one tormentor in Peter Parker's dual life. Noticeable improvements can be seen in the performances of James Franco and Rosemary Harris. Harris as Peter's kindly Aunt May breathes a lot more life into her character this time round as the sole parental figure in Parker's life, ultimately becoming his inspiration for continuing to be Spider-Man. Franco has a real mess of a character to handle in Harry Osborn. Consumed by a lust for vengeance upon Spider-Man, who he believes murdered his father, and trying to take up his father's mantle at the family company, Oscorp, Harry is, whether he realizes it or not, becoming an exact copy of his father. This becomes more clear by the end of the movie. (you'll have to see it for yourself to figure out how) Franco conveys all these emotions convincingly, contrary to the shallow job he did on the first movie. It's good to see him improving as an actor. However, the show stealing performance has to go to Alfred Molina as multi-armed super villain Dr. Octopus. Molina does a spectacular job, perfectly inhabiting the complex character of Otto Octavius. What could have been a campy performance by someone else is a heartfelt and charismatic one in the hands of Molina. By spending some time with Otto and his wife and sensing the love that resonates between them, we know that he isn't really evil - just driven and determined that his 'dream for mankind' will succeed. It's just a darned shame that it seems like his character was stuffed into the script at the last moment just so Spider-Man has somebody to bash about, but fortunately, Molina's performance helps us forget this. Visually, he fits the part perfectly, looking like he just stepped out of the pages of a comic book, and his evil little smile was truly chilling! Molina put everything he had into the part to great effect: indeed, he lived, breathed and died Doc Ock. All in all, the Spidey folks throw us a well thought out and very successful sequel. All I can say is 'Bring on round three!' -9.5/10",10.0,pyrocitor,2004/08/13,3,3
1873,The Green Mile,A movie is only as good what you put into it,"First of all, this movie fails like most Stephen King conversions to the big screen. Stephen King is a horrible writer, one of the worst of the 20th Century. His base characterizations are like poorly sketched comic book characters. The only thing that saves this movie are the actors supporting Tom Hanks (Sam Rockwell and Harry Dean Stanton to name two). Tom Hanks has a great money making face but his acting is pretty bland and sub-standard in most movies. The writing, however, is just stupid as most King ventures. Grown men get scared and pee their pants and the ironies that he is able to present are so obvious they are like being hit in the face with a building (very BIG black man is a sweet and harmless innocent).

1875,Detachment,You are in for a world of hurt,"Wow! I was not expecting this movie to be this engaging. Its one of those films that leave you sitting in silence for a while when the credits roll much like excellent Dramas like ""Requiem for a dream"" or ""Downloading Nancy"". This one spells it out pretty clear with the line ""Henry Barthes is all of us""... its hard to grasp how the realization that we are indeed all the same can be so painful. On the surface ""Detachment"" deals with the crumbling American education system through the eyes of substitute teacher Henry Barthes (played by Adrian Brody) who starts a new assignment in a new school with new teachers, in a new class with new pupils like he is obviously used to. The beginning shows him trying to get into this new class around the bullies threatening him and other pupils, making it hard to teach anything. At first it looks like all those ""good teacher turns around a bad class"" movies but its not. You soon realize that the school is just the backdrop for a larger story about a teacher who tries to do his job by taking a role outside the play. Barthes makes clear that he is hollow and words can't hurt him which is his way of coping with a hopeless situation by neglecting his private life and detaching from the world. Like him every teacher seems to have developed his individual coping mechanism. For some its cynicism and dark humor, ""happy pills"" are regularly mentioned too and for others its just swallowing their emotions until they erupt. You see the teachers coping with their daily routine while hearing an answering machine in the background every now and then with other teachers resigning or parents shouting for better grades for their kids. Its pretty tough stuff seeing kids void of hope, interest or enthusiasm and teachers trying to get to the few who are still to be reached in the classroom. But its here where it all falls apart because of hollow politics, parents that do not care or are just as dysfunctional as the kids they raised and dropped into the public education system and idiotic social rules and conventions we are all used to. When you see the pattern in all the peoples private lives and their desperate tries of holding on its obvious that ""Detachment"" is not just about the public school system but about our whole society, about each and every one of us. When Barthes meets a young street hooker he decides to take her in with him and do his job outside school. Its quite heartbreaking to see him trying to make a change against all odds. At times Barthes comes across like a modern day Jesus when he sleeps on the floor of his small apartment and lets the girl sleep in bed. Some might say that ""Detachment"" is too light on the teachers because most of the blame falls onto parents and politicians. There is hardly an unsympathetic teacher in this movie. Yet there are scenes that show Barthes is no Jesus at all... like when he violently shouts at a nurse in a retirement home after an incident with his dying grandfather. Barthes is indeed like all of us, cracking when he struggles to cope and lashing out to get out the pressure, just like the parents at school push their pressure to the teachers. And this is where the detachment cracks... amidst all the failures Barthes manages to connect to the girl, as well as to an outcast girl at school. And he connects through emotion and personal attachment but soon has to realize that it does not work. The scenes of him sending away the girl to a foster home when he tells her he cannot be her family or when he has do send away the outcast girl when she tries to share her sorrow with him are gut-wrenching. There are so many honest and deeply emotional scenes in this movie its hard to keep track. His grandfathers death with his total forgiving, Barthes monologues trying to make the pupils understand why they need basic education for their own sake are as brilliant as Lucy Lius Characters breakdown in which she shouts out her desperation and sadness towards a seemingly not caring girl. The relationship between Barthes and the girl is stunning and constantly rocked by misunderstandings... plain because you don't expect it to be non-sexual with all the pedophile stories, sexual harassment laws and stereotypes. But against all odds it is and you realize that when there are no parents (like in the haunting ""parents night"" scenes with teachers waiting and no one coming) someone else must fill this void... how empty have we become that we cannot expect someone to help out of honest interest for his fellow man... or rather child?! ""Detachment"" is a bleak and painful movie but it has some hope and even some humor (the cynic teachers way of teaching a girl about the dangers of STD with a picture of a rainbow and a picture of a disease ridden vagina is one of those much needed lighter moments). Its like when Barthes says in one of his many off commentaries... life is an ocean of chaos and the realization that you are the one supposed to throw the buoy while struggling to stay afloat is devastating. But its the honesty about his own struggle that makes him connect with others. Its when they realize we indeed are all the same, all struggling and they are not alone in their strife that gives them their humanity. But thats what life is... so what can you do but be honest and hope for the best.... Its all going to be OK!",9.0,dschmeding,2012/02/26,168,158
1876,The Wailing,"Astonishing ""Ambiguous Ending"" Horror","SPOILER: Have seen a lot of films, reviewed a lot of films but this extraordinary two and a half hour technically-perfect humanistic horror film from one of the finest writer/directors in the business (auteur of I SAW THE DEVIL) was something of a cipher. The closest analog I can suggest in David Lynch's 2001's Mulholland Drive, yet another technically perfect, humanistic, suspense opus which keeps you captivated for its full length, yet has you walking out of the theatre shaking your head and wondering what exactly you just saw? Both film-makers understand the ""big secret"" of story telling which is, if you can present your story in such a way that the viewer feels he or she is sharing the experience with the protagonist, you can tell any story you like and the viewer will just keep going. I will not even try to provide an explanation for what THE WAILING means, other than to re-quote the writer/director himself who, in numerous interviews on his film, said enigmatically ""I began to wonder about the nature of God -- what if he was not always good?"" Recommended on many levels. As entertainment, as a puzzle, and as a clinic in how to make a film that engages ... and just won't let go.",9.0,A_Different_Drummer,2016/12/07,170,121
1877,Intermission,"It does what it sets out to do in all its flashy, disposable glory.","It would seem even the Irish are getting in on the act of coming up with their own 'Pulp Fiction'. Is it too naive to underpin Pulp Fiction as the one film from the last dozen or so years that has had the most influence on the crime genre as a whole? The British, through Guy Ritchie, made Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels; I frequently hear Run Lola Run toted as Germany's answer to the quick witted, postmodernist roller coaster of ever-entwining story equilibriums and from South America; City of God in its equally brutal, intriguing but humbling glory. Is Intermission a particularly great film? Not at all. But does it lead you down a relatively enjoyable crime-fuelled road of quick wit; young and criminal minded people getting into all sorts of mischief and general disposable pleasure? I would say so. The real occasions during which Intermission goes off on one and doesn't generally work is when it delves into humour that revolves around either sex or relationships. One such strand to the film sees a character named John, played by Cillian Murphy, getting over his break up with a girl. If I list the events that follow this then you'll read that later on, the characters will visit a nightclub full of middle aged women in an attempt to 'meet' one of them and at other times we will witness others pleasuring themselves to pornography. These are the overall failings of the film; a segment that tries to make sex or themes of a sexual nature 'quite funny' and it just fails for anyone not familiar with the dry and tasteless humour usually found in a tabloid newspaper. But when Intermission isn't dealing with John and his buddy, it focuses on a couple of other colourful characters in and around Dublin. Ben (O'Suilleabhain) is an ambitious TV director-come-journalist looking for a genuine story in order to break into the industry; while Colin Farrell is a young and charming thief named Lehiff whose introduction acts as the film's opening scene and perfectly sets up the smash-and-grab, juxtaposed content, wannabe thrill ride the film is overall. Additionaly, Colm Meaney plays policeman Jerry Lynch who's always got his eye on things and has run ins with mostly everyone as he keeps the peace. In truth, the film is a little empty headed and doesn't provide the necessary wit nor the grimy look Lock, Stock did; nor does it shock us or act as a frightening yet enlightening look into a foreign culture as seen in City of God. The film flicks between being a heavy duty crime film in which women are beaten and their places of business are robbed whilst hard bodied crime genre caricatures have heated confrontations but maintains a light hearted (sometimes light headed) and jovial atmosphere, allowing all the steam out when you wish it wouldn't The film also sees a spectacular bus crash pretty early on, on which Sally (Henderson) feels the effects of low self esteem through constant accusation she has a slight tash above her mouth. There is a certain amount of jealousy reserved for her sister Deirdre (Macdonald), who's linked to John from earlier having just broken up with him. In addition to this, Sam (McElhatton) is a middle aged man who abruptly leaves his wife. There's a lot going on in Intermission, or at least it sounds like there is. The entire film is crammed down into just over an hour and a half, with a fair balance given to each character as their desperate situations play out and they engage with one another. This isn't a love/hate film; it's not a sprawling film about questioning one's role in life and society as everything else seems to fall apart around you alá Magnolia. Intermission knows its place. It's a grubby and grimy little pulp magazine that bites off more than it can chew; doesn't really make a study out of any of it, but chews to the best of its ability and downs it all without a fuss. The trouble is, with so much of this going on and all of it to cram in, the scenes in which you really feel immersed in the experience don't last that long. Certain things happen and one thing leads to another before a group of characters are holding a hostage as someone else must rob a place of business. Other times, I wanted to see more of Farrell's character. Instead, the film has to rely on young kids of about ten years old swearing to get across whatever few laughs there should be. The film feels it has the right to dip into ideas of divorce; sisterhood bonding; break ups and loneliness but then invites us to laugh at a middle aged woman attempting rough sex with someone they've just met and it's just disjointed. While the film is nothing special, it is disposable nonsense that proves Pulp Fiction's influence on a crop of film-makers more than anything. For people wanting something a little more mature, look elsewhere.",6.0,johnnyboyz,2009/03/03,1,0
1878,Goodfellas,"Graphic and glorious, just in need of condensation","Exploring the rise and fall of a gangster, Goodfellas dawdles on Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) from his childhood when he first started as an errand boy for the local mob on across the street, to the height of his life when he unexpectedly has to make a decision that changes his life. By this time Henry is so entangled in the mafia that it has become his whole social life  from his friends, his wife, his job to his values  he is consumed in a camaraderie. The film is based on a true story and given its content and realistic photography approach, it feels strangely like a documentary. Director Martin Scorsese, who grew up on the gritty crime-infested streets of New York said: ""I remember seeing it on the streets and thinking, this is the way a movie should look like."" To convey this realistic tone, the camera thus coldly follows Henry around everywhere and it does not shy away from violence or unpleasant diversions, as is Scorsese's style. It invests the whole film in a behind-the-scenes atmosphere, where the director expertly wields a long, continuous reel of exclusive footage. Several takes are of steadicams gliding through the world for minutes, as when Henry and Karen park their cark, cross the street and enter the Copacopana where they are pampered by Henry's connections. It's raw and unflinching and truly absorbs you in Henry's life as a wiseguy, climbing the mafia hierarchy. He often botches his way through jobs; he has a hard time whacking people and he clumsily cheats on his wife Karen (Lorraine Bracco)  the danger of the character is that you like him. Ray Liotta fantastically sews together the events as they unfold in a patient voice-over narrative flow. This flow is the film's fatal flaw. Sure, the pacing starts out nicely enough by having Henry slowly climb the mafia ladder along with his wiseguy friends Jimmy (Robert De Niro) and Tommy (Joe Pesci), both of whom are equally charismatic characters  the latter with rapid-fire dialogue and a rapid-fire gun and Pesci winning an Oscar for his colourful performance. It's all compelling at first BUT as is the usual mistake by Scorsese... he dilutes his film. It's like he got so taken with the mafia content that he wanted so much more of it for his own self-indulgence. There are numerous scenes that serve no other purpose than giving us a feel for the mafia family and the way things are run. It is true that some of them are important for establishing the atmosphere, but there are too many of them. The pace thus shifts from patient to lingering and the plot suffers countless detours and diversion into the life of crime. It loses focus. I cannot figure out whether this 'diluting the film' approach is Scorsese's style or an unfortunate mistake he keeps repeating in every film of his. Nevertheless, it makes Goodfellas dawdle leisurely without any clear sense of point or direction for long periods of time. Everything else in the film is fantastic, no hyperbole. Scorsese takes a deep plunge into wiseguy culture, indulging in mob dialogue that snaps and crackles like kindling in a fireplace, brutal hits, sleek heists and rats. He navigates moods, themes, characters, and popular music (which is used throughout as a background device) with expert skill and less than twenty minutes into the film, you are so absorbed in the characters' lives of crime that you know of nothing else. As for acting, it is Ray Liotta who grabs my attention as Henry, and not the resident scene-stealer Robert De Niro. I also fell in love with Lorraine Bracco's performance as Henry's Jewish wife  whose kickass attitude and sparkling personality translates well on camera. The greatest sheer presence can best be attributed to Paul Sorvino as the big-shot boss Paulie who, in spite of not saying a word until half of the film has passed, communicates a fantastic lethality. The reason the whole ensemble shines in their performances stems from the fact that they aren't acting like their characters; they are behaving like them. Of course the whole of Goodfellas is of the utmost quality but it could be even greater by being more condensed, as good most of Martin Scorsese's long-winded, diluted and slightly self-indulgent films. 8 out of 10",8.0,Flagrant-Baronessa,2006/09/30,19,10
1879,Intermission,Dubliners,"Whoever had the idea of bringing together the most brilliant talent of the Irish cinema for this film ought to be congratulated. This is a movie that is a lot of fun to watch. The underlying theme seems to be the changes in the Irish society brought upon by the global economy. Most of the things this globalization brings is good for a certain section of the population, mainly the moneyed classes, but nothing for those that have to take menial jobs because they have nothing to contribute, or are in the margins of that society, or are rebelling against the changes. The characters in John Crowley's film are not the new privilege class being created by the advent of new business and technology, but those that are still struggling with a daily existence, trying hard to make ends meet, but not succeeding at it. The opening scene with the magnificent Colin Farrell is something not to be believed. It comes so fast that we almost don't have time to register what has occurred. The acting is superb. Besides Colin Farrell, Shirley Henderson, as the spooky Sally, the little ""grey riding hood"" with a mustache, is hilarious. Also Colm Meaney, who is always good in every thing he does. He is an honest actor who lets us know who he is in every role he plays. As the detective Jerry Lynch, he is one of the best things in the film. Equally excellent are Cillian Murphy and Kelly MacDonald. Of course, I have read some comments in this forum that have been written by Irish film lovers that are critical of the picture, but to someone else's eyes, such as this viewer, the film was a lot of fun.",8.0,jotix100,2004/04/29,8,2

I even shed a tear at the finale of this wonderful tale. This movie appeals to all ages.

1881,Crash,Predictable and Overrated,"Haggis had the previously luck of a weak script, highlighted by a surprise ending, and a strong cast for Million Dollar Baby. Haggis has the same situation for Crash, which I viewed at an advance screening. Crash follows the stories of a number of LA people as they deal with race issues (both as perpetrators and victims) from cops to wives to grocery store owners to blue collar workers, etc. Don Cheadle and Matt Dillion are wonderfully complex in their roles as a tough detective that has to sacrifice his dignity and morality in order to protect his brother and support his addict mother and a cop whose racial prejudice stems from his father's physical ailments, respectively. Ludicrous plays a gangster, a solid but not overwhelming performance. The film does a terrific job of creating tense moments that stimulate the race nerve but it does little to bring up the greater issues of prejudice to be discussed after the movie's over.",1.0,dynamitellama,2005/05/11,150,80
1882,The Green Mile,Archetypal biblical-like theme of human nature,"I think this movie addresses a universal theme that's almost biblical in nature: Man is basically evil. He will manufacture and rationalize in his own way to distort good (in this case a good man named John Coffey) into evil (Jesus Christ suffered the same fate.) The question pose by this movie as we identify with the main character prison guard Paul Edgecomb(Tom Hanks) who is in the position as a modern day Pontius Pilate is this: When we are faced with what is told to us and packaged to us as evil, and we discover to the contrary, are we bound to be an agent to evil or do we have the backbone and strength of spirit to expose the wrongdoing and act on our principles for what is right?

I can't remember who, but I am glad they did. The theatrical debut of Edward Norton, who took most of the awards and nominations for this film, including an Academy Award nomination for his performance. He is the accused, the ""Butcher Boy"" that allegedly killed the Archbishop. But, it is not just Norton that shine. Richard Gere gives what is probably his best performance as a defense attorney that chases the sensational cases. Sure, it's a police procedural, but it is so much more because of some great performances. In addition to the two mentioned, there is Laura Linney, John Mahoney, Alfre Woodard, Frances McDormand, and Andre Braugher. A super cast! The surprises that come out will have you riveted to the screen. They are amazing! Boy, did Martin (Gere) set up the DA (Linney). You shouldn't do that when you are lovers outside the courtroom, but he'll smooth it over. But,...oh, well, you'll have to see for yourself.",9.0,lastliberal,2009/07/09,2,2
1887,Hotel Transylvania,I loved this movie!,"Everyone remembers that special movie they saw or that one that was the best for your mind, that one which really stuck. For me that movie was ""Hotel Transylvania"". I think it was one of the best children's movie ever made. It conveys humor, creativity, action and freedom. Set in Transylvania in modern time, Dracula (Adam Sandler) hosts all the legendary monsters at his hotel to celebrate his daughter's one hundred and eighteenth birthday. But he works overtime to keep Mavis (Selena Gomez) from falling for a human boy named Johnny (Andy Samberg), who miraculously stumbles upon the hotel. All Mavis has ever wanted is to leave home and see the real world and see if humans are as bad as her father says they are. The main characters are Selena Gomez as Mavis, Andy Samberg as Johnny and Adam Sandler as Dracula. It is a brilliant cast for this movie. Selena Gomez was perfect for the part of Mavis and did a great job while Andy Samberg was good but wasn't perfect for Johnny. I think he could've done a much better job. Adam Sandler was born to play the part of Dracula. He did a magnificent job and was extremely humorous. The other characters were great and they matched their roles perfectly! I liked that we got to know the characters and what their goal was. For example Mavis wanted freedom and wanted to leave home. What I didn't like is that it was a bit confusing. For example, ""Why was Johnny hiking in Transylvania at night?"" or ""Why didn't Mavis just turn in to a bat and fly away to see the real world?"" These questions make you wonder but I still think it was a wonderful movie even for my age group. I think the moral of the story was trust your children to make the right decisions no matter what you think about them and from the child point of view the moral was to know your parents are always just trying to protect you. And both are true and if you look at them from both sides you will get the full story. I think that this is a movie for age groups above five and below fifteen. Reason being because Dracula does a fang up where his face goes a bit creepy but other wise I'm sure parents will love it and children between the ages of five and fifteen will love it to.",9.0,mackenziekaylyn,2012/10/21,48,29

1889,Primal Fear,Fantastic drama,"Primal Fear has a great deal to offer as a film. It has a compelling plot, interesting twists and some amazing acting, notably by Edward Norton. In contrast to many court room dramas, Primal Fear avoids getting itself bogged down in the court room and instead focuses on character and events around the murder which, in my opinion, is far more interesting. The way the plot continuously unravels throughout the film is a definite strong point and is the films method of maintaining the attention of the audience. The conspiracies surrounding the murdered Bishop are disturbing and done very convincingly. The court room scenes are all done very professionally and give the actors a real chance to shine individually. The film is paced very well which prevents a single boring moment, very accomplished direction. This film boasts a very strong cast and all give good performances. Richard Gere once again, plays a version of himself and gives his usual, reliable, sleazy performance. Laura Linney is so good in this film, that I can not help but hate her anytime I see her in another film (even Love Actually!). Linney excels in the court room scenes; cutting a great image of the bitter, ruthless prosecution lawyer. Her performance is out shined, however, by Edward Norton. Norton is a great actor and this is definitely one of his standouts. He is so believable and the way his character constantly goes through a metamorphosis is very convincing. Frances McDormand and Steve Bauer do a great job in support, adding further class to the film. The best thing about the film is the ending. I won't give anything away but it's well worth the wait.

1890,Spider-Man 2,It can't be stopped. It's self-sustaining now.,"""He knows a hero when he sees one. Too few characters out there, flying around like that, saving old girls like me. And Lord knows, kids like Henry need a hero. Courageous, self-sacrificing people. Setting examples for all of us. Everybody loves a hero. People line up for them, cheer them, scream their names. And years later, they'll tell how they stood in the rain for hours just to get a glimpse of the one who taught them how to hold on a second longer. I believe there's a hero in all of us, that keeps us honest, gives us strength, makes us noble, and finally allows us to die with pride, even though sometimes we have to be steady, and give up the thing we want the most. Even our dreams."" I went back to look at this one, my favorite, again. If it wasn't for the success of Sam Raimi's Spider-man 2, there would be no 3. The direction, sound, special effects, and the characters all combined to make an enjoyable adventure. This had Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) at her best and really focused on her relationship with Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire). Alfred Molina was fantastic as Doc Ock.

No redeeming value except for some great acting by Farhad and the locksmith guy...I felt like flicking out Ludicrous' eyes out and see if he could still fly around, he was so annoying. Cinematography was excellent. Way overly preachy, yet it tried to hide behind a good-and-oh-so-confusing-evil twin makeup in each half baked character.

1894,Taxi Driver,An individual's fight- against loneliness and for justice.,"""Taxi Driver"" is a beautiful portrayed of an individual who tries to do things his way, in the hectic and dangerous New York of the '70's. He already isn't a stable person to begin with (he's a Vietnam veteran) but through his loneliness and due to his own personal views and idea's of society and the world, he gets more and more consumed by the rotten society until he feels it is enough and decides to take matters into his own hands. Beauty of the movie is that it gets interpreted by everyone in his or hers own way. Everyone sees some different things in the story and characters. I think this also was what writer Paul Schrader and director Martin Scorsese had in mind, while making this movie. The story takes us into the world of Travis Bickle. We begin to see society through his eyes and we more and more begin to understand the character as the movie progresses. It makes his character not only a understandable one but also a very realistic one. Nothing in this movie is overdone or made to look better or worser than it is in real life. The movie is made extra powerful through the performances of the cast. Robert De Niro is a sensational main lead and the supporting cast is also real great. Some well known actors that were still unknown at the time of this movie make an appearance, such as a very young Jodie Foster, Albert Brooks, Victor Argo and an almost unrecognizable young Harvey Keitel. The entire movie is sensational- and with lots of style directed by Martin Scorsese, who knows how to set the right mood and atmosphere. The simple- but effective and realistic from Michael Chapman and the musical score by Bernard Herrmann (his last) also add to the atmosphere. Also of course the fact that New York City serves as the backdrop for this movie, gives the movie a typical dark and gritty feeling and atmosphere. Everything is slowly but powerfully build up in the movie and every sequences plays a significant role. A result of this is that the movie is filled with some unforgettable sequences, of which the famous 'You talking' to me?' sequence is the best known. But also the violent ending leaves a lasting impression. It's still a movie that applies today, after 30 years now. Because lets face it, what exactly has been changed in society compared to 30 years ago and now? The subject and meaning of the movie could still apply to present day. It makes ""Taxi Driver"" a timeless and important movie that is a perfect reflection of society and already is worthy of the 'classic'-status. Yet another essential '70's viewing. 10/10 [URL]",10.0,Boba_Fett1138,2006/02/18,35,23
1895,Interstellar,Not sure what the fuss is about,"Not a terrible movie but not half as good as some reviewers would have you believe. Firstly a lot has been made of you needing a degree in quantum physics to understand the movie. Not so, the premise is exactly the same as his last move 'inception', time moves slower the deeper you go or in this case nearer the event horizon of a black-hole. Don't need to be a genius to understand that. Secondly a lot has been made of his revolutionary mixing of 'dazzling' science fiction and an intimate human story. As for the human story, it's clunky and at times cringe-worthy. It's dull and not particularly well handled with amateurish dialogue characteristic of the Nolan films. If you want to see a movie where the relationship between father and daughter is far better handled watch 'Contact'. As for the science fiction I'd have to say I was disappointed. Parts were very spectacular but I was not impressed by the planet scenes. Iceland yet again and a water planet with shallow seas and massive waves? I was somehow expecting more than this.

1896,Spider-Man 2,"""Face it, Tiger ...","... you just hit the jackpot"", Mary Jane Watson ~ Dialogue straight out of the comic book ensuring that this sequel is going to be well worth the wait! OK, not quite as good as the first - sequels seldom are - but a valiant effort on the part of Sam Raimi. Here we have the next big Super Villain, Dr Otto Octavius/Doctor Octopus (Alfred Molina), who is about to further complicate Spider-Man's (Tobey Maguire) already failing personal life: Parker is experiencing financial difficulties and his studies are slipping. To top it all off, Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) is now engaged to astronaut John Jameson, son of Parker's overbearing newspaper editor, Jonah. Things just go from bad to worse for the web-slinger. Meanwhile, following the death of his father (the Green Goblin), Harry Osborn has now now taken over Oscorp Industries and is in business talks with Dr Otto Octavius. The Doctor, Parker's idol, has created a set of mechanical arms that are impervious to heat and magnetism; the experiment goes wrong and the arms become fused to the spine of Octavius, taking complete control of the doctor both mentally and physically. Aunt May is later captured and taken hostage by Dr Octopus. Spider-Man too falls prey to capture and is delivered to Harry, where his true identity is under threat. How much can one guy take? 'Spider-Man 2' is all about choices for Peter Parker: lose his alter-ego and concentrate on number one or continue with the responsibility he chose after the death of Uncle Ben ~ Raimi has skillfully recreated the classic scene - panel-for-panel - from Amazing Spider-Mam #50, Spider-Man No More, written by Stan Lee, pencilled by John Romita, and inked by Mickey Dimeo. Here Parker is seen leaving a rainy alleyway where his discarded costume hangs from the throat of a garbage can. Raimi has concentrated on the Parker who is forced to deal with actual everyday problems in Spider-Man 2, one we can all sympathize with. Parker's character outweighs that of other superheroes, for the simple fact that - at heart - he is just an ordinary guy trying to exist in a complicated world. Also stars: Bill Nunn, J K Simmons, Ted Raimi, Bruce Campbell with Cliff Robertson and Willem Dafoe. Matthew J Lee-Williams, Review.",9.0,Mister_Gordon_Shumway,2007/12/04,22,16

To watch the actors, you would think that they are the actual characters. Laura Dern, a favorite actress of mine, left nothing out of her performance. The young actors playing the Rocket Boys showed talent beyond their years, especially young Homer. Homer's father inspired that eternal love/hate relationship between a father and son so that it felt real. If you don't get a lump in your throat or shed a tear when that first successful rocket goes up or when father and son come to terms, then get your pulse checked (you may be dead).",10.0,redgreen40,2001/11/08,2,2
1898,Interstellar,"Unmatched visuals and writing, yet sentimentalist and most definitely not Nolan's best directorial work","I will keep this short for the sake of not spoiling anything. Right off i should say I love Nolan. I adore most of his movies, and Interstellar is no exception. It is a marvelous piece of work whose visuals will be hard to forget. His shots of space and the way he played with colors is rather masterful. Maybe i expected it to be greater than what i saw, but even though i was moved by the movie i did not quite feel like he created something great with 'Interstellar.' This could be attributed maybe to his overuse of sentimentalism in the father-daughter relationship he creates. Nolan really tries to make you cry with this one. I have never seen him use such powerful emotions in his movies; however that is not necessarily a good thing for this movie, given that he uses his time trying to develop a family relationship at the expense of flow and congruency. Again, the Visuals are completely off the charts. The visual imagery is truly beautiful and something that Nolan has always excelled at. Given that the most visually stunning movie in recent years, Gravity, recently came out, Interstellar does not lag behind and shows you a spectacle of Visual effects.He will most likely win Visual effects at the Oscars. The Hans's score is marvelous and will most likely earn an Oscar nomination. Matthew Mcconaughey's acting is good, but nothing stellar, especially coming off the best acting role of his career. He plays the character like it should be played, but Nolan's characters never being truly drawn out or rounded does not help him any.The same can be said for the rest of the cast. The little girl was marvelous though. I do not want to reveal any piece of the story whatsoever, but i have to say, it is one of the most original scripts i've ever seen. Ultimately this movie is entertaining. There is no way Nolan can miss that. Another great thing that Nolan excels at is INSPIRING. By the time the credits rolled and people walked out, I sat there still in awe at the strong sense of human will the movie conveys. Personally, I don't think this is Nolan's best. I believe Memento stands as his masterpiece. But with Nolan, everyone has their own favorite movie. Maybe for some, Interstellar will be their favorite movie, for it is really Nolan's most ambitious and visually-striking work. By the way, Anyone else who even tries to compare Interstellar to ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is out of their mind. Kubrick's mission was to create art. Nolan in ""Interstellar"" sets to awe and inspire its audiences. It is truly a great piece of work.",6.0,gonzaloltovilla,2014/10/29,1786,837

Everything about it is perfect - the script is perfect, and so is the directing. And don't get me started about the acting. Richard Gere nailed his part, and this was at the time he actually played in good films. But the one who steals the show here is without ANY DOUBT young Edward Norton in his first big part. His acting is nothing but brilliant and even genius and even here you can understand why he's one of the best actors to ever grace the screen. You have to see it to understand, since I do not want to spoil the story for you. The supporting cast is also very solid, and I loved seeing John Mahoney (best known for playing Martin Crane, in sitcom ""Frasier"") as the corrupt Maire of Chicago.

1901,Crash,Avoid it - it's an insult to anyone's intelligence,"Crash is about thirty-six hours in the lives of various, disparate people in Los Angeles, told as a series of interconnecting vignettes. Some of the people are good, hardworking souls just trying to scrape by, and others are bad people bent on destruction and menacing. By the end, though, some of the good people have done bad things, and some of the bad people have done good things. And they all grew as people as a result. This wasn't an easy movie to get through. To begin with, nearly every character is despicable in his or her own way. Not so much that one can easily classify them as Bad, no - it's more as if each was being presented as a Good person with Flaws. The downside to that, though, is that it makes rooting for any of the characters is nearly impossible. Another problem is the writing. Everything is film with such a heavy, hamfisted attitude! Person A has something happen to them, so of COURSE they're going to emerge as a better person as a result. I mean, I'm glad that things don't always turn out like rainbows and unicorns and happy crap like that for our brave characters, but does their redemption (or fall from grace) have to happen so obviously? It's as if the viewer has been hit over the head with a frying pan - BAM! THIS PERSON DID A BAD THING. THEY ARE NOW NOT AS GOOD AS YOU THOUGHT. And then BAM! you get hit again, because the same knucklehead did something else. I didn't like anybody, and I had a strong sense that if I ran into any of them, anywhere, they sure as heck wouldn't like me, either. What a bunch of miserable, whiny, self-obsessed, self-absorbed twits these people are. Convinced they are right, they haphazardly stomp about the movie, glaring menacingly at people who are different from them, which naturally is supposed to teach us, the unwashed audience, that Different Is Good, and these people Just Don't Get It (Yet). Paul Haggis wrote, directed, coproduced, and wrote some of the music for the movie. Interestingly enough, the Scottish dish haggis smells just as bad as this movie. What should have been melodramatic was instead uproariously funny; it helps when you've actively decided to dislike the characters. I wished for their deaths, and I bet some of you will, too. Don Cheadle continues to prove he's a great actor, and Ludicrous was surprisingly convincing, walking away with most of his scenes. But the rest of the gang was dull and trite, doing little with the admittedly awful material with which they had to work. But don't feel too bad for them, folks, because at least they didn't have to listen to the soundtrack, which seemed to consist of one long Enya-like tribute. I suspect it was actually several songs, but it seemed like a continuous stream of overemoting - and inappropriately, at that. You know how in horror films there's this music that'll play that lets the audience know Something Bad Is Gonna Happen? That's what the music here was, only it never stopped.",1.0,dfranzen70,2005/11/07,90,50

1903,Goodfellas,useless,"The worst thing that could happen when you are watching a movie is that you don't care, you couldn't care less. That is what happened when I saw it and mind you this is no lousy production or a B-movie, I mean the main actors are people like Deniro, Sorvino, Pesci... It doesn't work. There is nothing intriguing, there is nothing ironical. Ray Liotta starts jazzing right away taking himself oh! so seriously and I couldn't care less. All characters are unpleasant. This movie is completely off balance. The inside scenes are too dark. The light is terrible. And I am sick and tired of these Scorsese movies with the background music so loud!

1904,Ferris Bueller's Day Off,Yet another boring teen comedy,"I don't know why this movie got a score of 7.7 out of 10. It's just another boring teen comedy. Those three high school guys are doing actually nothing on their day off. Just going to restaurant, to a baseball match, etc. The high school principal is a funny character trying to catch the slackers, but has a forced humor. Okay, there are some funny scenes in the movie, e.g. Ferri's father spotting his son in a taxi or in the crowd for a moment, and then in the next moment the guy disappears as he had never been there. I dare say this movie is good for a rainy afternoon, but otherwise don't waste time watching it. I'll rate this move 4/10.",4.0,sycul,2005/03/09,29,13
1905,Horrible Bosses 2,1st better than the second?,"So, after watching the first film on DVD, I had to go and see the 2nd! However, I didn't find myself laughing as much as the first time round, and for me I feel it was no longer about their 'horrible bosses'. If you think the film continues with the original story, you are wrong. The 3 men try to launch their own Shower buddy product, and when they go to get it invested into, it backfires. The original cast is still the same, but 2 new characters are added in, and the father and son duo create the new storyline. The 3 men threaten the father by kidnapping his son, even though his son knows about it. After what seemed to me like a very long main story, it finally got good at the end, when the father is killed and the son attempts to get the 3 men arrested, which also backfires. The two horrible bosses from the first film are still in the story line, but it is not about them any more. And for me, I think that ruined the whole story when they become freelance workers, and not as much humour is there any more. I rate the film 7 out of 10.",7.0,tlhalford,2014/12/12,19,8
1906,Interstellar,Shoot me,"Previously having been a fan of a few of Nolan's films that actually were the opposite of what this film is - masterpieces, I peeked at the ratings here on IMDb. However had I scrolled further down to see where they were coming from and what the reviews really were, I probably would've discovered the truth and not have decided to take the inevitable trip into this black hole with Nolan and suffer, something I am extremely embarrassed about and will always be haunted for. Unfortunately I cannot get the three hours of my life taken away by this film. Do not watch this. At a great probability, an atrocious waste of money went into making this because I couldn't help but question where it all went. It probably went into a black hole. Common sense was extremely uncommon in the entire film and to an extent that would actually anger you, making you wonder how stupid the director thinks of you otherwise. Like plenty others, I felt a necessary urge to be informant about this tragedy and so created an IMDb account just to write this. Not surprisingly, I found that a lot of others have already said most of what I wanted to say about the film.I'm going to try to sum up some scenes, shortened to the best of my ability that would give you an idea of how awful this movie really was and how dreadful my time went sitting through it all hoping to find a little substance somewhere down the line, being a patient guy. On the real this movie is not even worth your 10 dollars on a DVD rental. You'd probably sleep through all of it in any case. So I spend twenty dollars to go see this and upon the first ten minutes I find myself looking back at my life wondering where I had gone wrong to deserve this. To begin with, the start of this film with Mathew McConaughey on some unknown farmland somewhere and who knows where, does not create any picture or lead you anywhere for you to even develop one on your own, to get a hold of whether an 'Interstellar' will actually begin to unfold or whether not. Our lead, with his kids drives his truck off road down on to fields of corn ( with a flat tire ) to follow what seems to be some ""Nasa test drone/ robot plane"", as soon as he spots it randomly flying in the air. So he drives with his kids for say over twenty minutes with the flat as his car runs down heavy bushes of corn fields, where he commands his kid son to ""take the wheel"" while he moves in the backseat now to turn on his laptop through which he has decided to and even knows how to track this drone! From this point on I tried hard to stay awake. He later just happens to stumble upon a Nasa base that also happens to be only minutes away from where he lives. I steady awake to the part where our hero gets out the car outside the Nasa base with blinding lights in front of him. Next, he gets whacked by a robot, taken hostage and then wakes up in front of Anne Hathaway, inside the base. Then you've got Michael Caine telling him that he is ""the chosen one"" to fly a rocket in spite of the fact that Matthew mistakenly discovered the base. After exchanging a few words, our hero seems fit to be the pilot of the rocket ship ( without real training ) for a mission everybody is newly introduced to. What is this mission about? To go find another planet that would sustain life because Earth is no longer going to be a hospitable place in a few years although no one knows why. That is not it. Guess where they're all going to look for one? In a black hole. Forty minutes deep and you'll find that by now you'd rather walk out because it doesn't really matter anymore how the film turns out. Later nearing the end, McConaughey's ship is about to run out of fuel any minute where the ship explodes at full capacity leaving him to fall into the black hole to find himself in a five dimensional wall space. Here he communicates to Earth with the assistance of the robot that should've been destroyed in that ship, to his daughter through a wrist watch lying on her bedroom shelf at home and she happens to sense what is exactly going on Wow this was just terrible. Now, to all those of you who have the slightest idea of what a black hole is and what it does or doesn't do for that matter, do not waste your time watching this even on DVD. In fact, make sure you do not waste your hours even watching it for free on television shortly soon because it would make you so sad, scared and bored all at the same time like you couldn't believe. Not one minute of this film was ""possible"" if you like, even bit by bit, to create any practical sense of what went on or even what could have come out of it. This movie was so bad I came out paralyzed. To my horror, I'm left with no words to describe the experience and I'm only trying. I consider myself pretty tough after having the courage to sit entirely through and not walk out within the first twenty minutes like I should have done.",1.0,BruthaVincent,2014/11/22,243,111
1907,Detachment,"Angst: A Brilliant, Compelling Mirror for Us All","DETACHMENT is an extraordinary achievement in filmmaking. Written by first time writer Carl Lund and directed by the controversial Tony Kaye (one would never know, but he performs music and comedy at open mics around Los Angeles), and presented by one of the finest ensemble casts imaginable, this film should be required viewing for everyone from junior high to the elderly. In one poignant story we are provided glimpses into the current status of our public education, the plight of burned out teachers attempting to repair the absent parent syndrome while reaching out to find a place beyond drugs, fighting, physical and mental abuse and the lethargy of responding to a chaotic world, and a dark view of the existentialism that allows each of us to forge ahead despite a sense of worth in a world gone crazy. Henry Barthes (Adrien Brody in a galvanizing performance) copes with life as a substitute teacher: he comes into schools for a specific stint then detaches and repeats the cycle of caring to provide hope for kids to become someone of significance, failing repeatedly. He is assigned to a New York school headed by the soon to be fired Principal Carol Dearden (Marcia Gay Harden), meets a classroom of foul mouthed, disrespectful, angry students and attempts to teach them English. He is immediately challenged by a sassy kid whom he sends out of the room, a young angry black student with whom he connects by showing him parameters of interaction, a young obese, disturbed but gentle Meredith (Betty Kay, in a sterling performance) among others. He also encounters the other teachers and staff - the beautiful Sarah Madison (Christina Hendricks), the school counselor Dr. Doris Parker (Lucy Liu), the burned out Mr. Wiatt (Tim Blake Nelson) and Ms Perkins (Blythe Danner) and Mr. Sarge Kepler (William Peterson), and only teacher who fights back with a sense of humor Mr. Charles Seaboldt (James Caan). It is a grim situation and Henry takes his depression home. Henry encounters a young girl Erica (Sami Gayle, in a career making role) who despite her youth is a street hooker, beaten badly by her johns. He offers her protection in his meager home - a place to sleep and eat and recover form the street abuse of her profession. A profound relationship develops - and while that satisfies Erica's desperate need for family, it frightens Henry enough to eventually call foster care to remove her. Henry visits his elderly mentally challenged Grandpa (Louis Zorich) who lives in a assisted living home and his frustrations about his memories of his apparently alcoholic suicidal mother and the lack of care being given his Grandpa results in one of Henry's rare explosions of anger - a rage that extends to every aspect of his view of life. At school Henry gradually wins the hearts and minds of his class, showing them that education is the path to living a life of meaning. His friendship with the beleaguered Meredith is supportive, but as Henry completes his three week assignment at the school tragedies surround him. It seems that everyone in the story is in a life and death struggle to find beauty in a seemingly vicious and loveless world. In addition to the actors mentioned there are shining little vignette roles by Celia Au, Renée Felice Smith, Kwoade Cross, and others - many appearing for the first time on film and each radiating talent. But the film belongs to Adrien Brody who provides such a staggeringly real character that his message is felt in every cell of the viewer's mind. This is a first rate film in every aspect. It should be seen by everyone who either shares the mental milieu of the characters depicted here or cares deeply about the sad chaotic situation we have created during these particular times.

1908,Spider-Man 2,"With a brain in its head and style on its side, this is one hell of a ride","Spider-Man 2 is an adrenaline-packed cinematic delight. A purely functioning superhero film, serving as a sequel to a film that was surprisingly capable after spending a fourth of a century in development hell. Not only is this one of the best sequels I have yet to see, but one of the strongest superhero epics of the decade. What little Raimi and the writers neglected in the original Spider-Man film is injected into this sequel with full-force intelligence, depth, and attitude. Certain action scenes are so artfully designed and professionally crafted, it appears they could serve as the long-awaited climax in any film of the genre. Scenes themselves play like epics within an epic and some, like the infamous train sequence, are so breakneck and excessive they could use an intermission. But Spider-Man 2 doesn't have time for preposterous breaks or intermissions. They would disrupt the flow of poetry the film so effortlessly excels at, and for that matter, it is too busy furthering Peter Parker's entertaining story and fueling its action scenes with the coherency and structure they need. The film takes place two years after the events of the first film. We see Parker is still doing vigilante justice around the city of New York, yet we see he is breathlessly struggling to juggle his alter-ego's duties, his schoolwork, his freelance photography job, and his own free time. Because of this, he has long been distant from the love of his life, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) and his best friend Harry Osborn (James Franco). Now that Harry is the leader of Oscorp, he has been funding research for the nuclear scientist, Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina). Octavius's goal is to perfect fusion power, and he creates and operates a harness equipped with several long, windy robotic arms that seem to take on a mind of their own. Unfortunately, due to a series of disasters, the arms are now sewn to his spinal-cord and have corrupted his mind and are now influencing his decisions and actions. Dr. Octavius, who will later be known as ""Doc Ock,"" serves as the main villain in the story, as one can expect. Parker not only must try and defeat Doc Ock, but must figure out how to get his spidey-legs working again after numerous web malfunctions, and has just learned that Mary Jane is engaged to an acclaimed astronaut. And don't even get him started about how he must continue to comfort his Aunt May, who is still grieving over the loss of her husband and Peter's uncle, as well as telling her the real truth about his death. Speaking as a sizable fan of the original Spider-Man, the one part I mentioned in my review was that Raimi showed Parker's newly-discovered powers to be all fun and games with no consequences or brewing agony. It was a chockablock of excitement for him, and never once did the story showcase how these powers would've inevitably burdened Parker with a barrage of responsibility and tribulations. It almost seems Raimi and the writers left that part out on purpose, so they could center the sequel primarily around the agony of being a superhero. If that was their plan, their have succeeded, because not only is this one of the most riveting and entertaining superhero films, it is also one of the deepest. Tobey Maguire, returning as Parker, bleeds charm and confidence in the role of a character that just has the charm part down. With the new Amazing Spider-Man film just released about two weeks ago, boasting the relatively new star Andrew Garfield in the central role, I can't help but remind readers who I believe is the real Peter Parker. Maguire's Parker has mastered the role of a shy nerd who lacks any and all confidence. Garfield's character was still in that nerd-position, but he was far more secure in his witticisms and his confidence. To me, Peter Parker is and always will be a nerd. Regardless of how tight and brazen his costume is. When it came down to the villain of the original Spider-Man, unlike many people, I was satisfied that it was the Green Goblin. If anything, Willem Dafoe portrayed the character in a lot more of an eerie light than I assume many others actors would've. Doc Ock is a more impressive villain in every sense. Quite possibly one of the most enticing to watch on screen. The Goblin, no matter which way you examine him, is a rather stock villain. Ock's robotic arms make for a never-ending line of possibilities and events, and the action sequences involving him are stylish and crafty, perfectly complimenting the film itself as a whole. Spider-Man 2 is a shivering example at what makes a great superhero film. It shows us what most of us want, which is explicitly entertaining action scenes, and the something extra I hope most of us crave, which is the humanity and exploration of the character. To show Parker's powers as a burden to him was a brilliant move on screenwriter Alvin Sargent's part (who would later go on to write the third part of this franchise and be one of the three to construct the new one) and Sam Raimi's. With a brain in its head and style on its side, this is one hell of a ride. Starring: Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, Alfred Molina, Rosemary Harris, and Donna Murphy. Directed by: Sam Raimi.",9.0,StevePulaski,2012/07/16,19,13
1909,The Green Mile,Like the drink only not spelled the same,"This movie was spectacular!! I was watching it intently from beginning to end and did not even notice the time. This movie is a true masterpiece. Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan were wonderful and the supporting cast was fantastic. Based on a serial novel by Stephen King, the Green Mile is about Paul Edgecomb, a officer in charge of prisoners on death row and everything was the same as usual until the day that John Coffey (Clarke Duncan) was brought to the mile. Coffey is an extraordinary person and Paul Edgecomb never believed in miracles until the day he met one. This movie is one of the best adaptations of a Stephen King novel that I have ever seen. I think that I would recommend this movie to everyone, and even if you don't like King's work I am certain that you will love this flick. This movie was robbed at the Academy Awards, but never the less, it is still one of the most memorable movies I have ever seen. A small warning though, if you are a bit squeemish then you may need to hide your eyes for a few scenes, but don't miss out on this movie because of it. I give this movie a 9.5 out of 10!!!",,Angel-54,2000/06/16,9,9
1910,Horrible Bosses 2,One Word: HILARIOUS.,"Despite some negative reviews, this film was a great sequel. Absolutely hilarious. It was just as funny if not funnier than the first. At first I was kind of skeptical after watching the trailer being that they invented something and tried to sell it, but it ended working really well and helped propel the story. Jamie Foxx's MF Jones was just as funny as he was last time. And Chris Pine did a great job! Love seeing Jason Bateman and Sudekis' style of acting mesh because they are so different. Charlie Day, that guy is funny as all heck, love him in Its Always Sunny in Philly, and I love him in this series. Jennifer Anniston is even more hot and bizarre in this one, I like her character because its unlike anything else she does, VERY dirty and kind of weird haha, but VERY HOT. If you liked the first film and the set of characters there is no doubt you will love this! An extremely solid 8 out of 10! Go watch it!",8.0,ariflopes,2014/11/30,55,27

1912,The Wailing,OK here's my opinion,"I think this could very easily have been a 10/10 movie ranked amongst the greatest horrors of all time. However the director appears to have been given slightly too much power. Rather than create a gripping, punchy narrative we instead get an arty conflicting narrative with a ""make your own interpretation"" ending. The movie is also considerably too long. I think the movie should have been heavily edited by the producers - it should have been cut down to around two hours. The strongest narrative strand was the one with the female ghost. Parts of the story that conflicted with this should have been altered. The zombie scene for example could have been made to fit with this narrative, it's a great scene though I wouldn't have cut it entirely. Also the photos needed to be explained - maybe the Japanese guy is actually keeping the zombies from returning to life? Then of course we need a punchier ending. I think it was of dubious taste to insert some Christian themes. There was NO GOOD REASON for the guy to trust the female ghost, a couple of Jesus references in no way can compensate for how suspicious she had behaved previously - she had made the shaman spew blood lets not forget (and the Shaman had appealed to Buddha for help). Lead character has developed some courage and stamina and is no longer just a wimp. He flees home to his family ready to crack skulls. Final battles rages, shaman and ghost are both killed perhaps? Priest character shows up from hospital and helps out too? OK, so I hear you say - it wasn't suppposed to be that sort of movie. But the rest of the movie was AMAZING - It could have appealed to EVERYBODY. Entertainment is still what most people are looking for in a movie. It didn't have to entirely make sense, but just make more sense than it did. .... then in a few years from now, the director could have reduced his own two and a half hour cut of the movie with the interpration ending.",7.0,Harold_Boss,2016/10/20,12,6
1913,Goodfellas,Classic gangster flick and it shows,"I love the way this film is shot, it looks like a moving Italian painting, and I think the cinematographer did that on purpose, my favourite shot is where Henry's wife was abused and he's walking up to the abuser, there's no dialogue just the sound of his shoes tapping the floor. There are no bad guys in this film the only bad guys are the main characters, and somehow you root for them, that's how you make a good bad guy, you can understand their intentions. And the acting? Oh my god. It feels like the cameraman's a ghost and he's just recording these people's daily life, they're all distinct and natural, even the background actors add to the realism of the world. There's narration throughout the whole film, films use this as a tool to dump exposition but this one uses it to explain the thoughts and feelings of the characters, it also shows how insanely twisted these gangsters are. Even though there isn't a main goal except for Harry wanting to be a gangster, this film manages to be entertaining through and through. It's another classic gangster flick. And goodfellas is an absolute 10/10",10.0,camwilcox,2020/04/29,11,8
1914,Death of a Salesman,A Brief Analysis of the Play/Movie in terms of its value as a modern tragedy (i posted on board as well),"I would have to agree with all of the previous analyses of this modern tragedy. I have studied this play in my Grade 12 English course for the past month and a half and was amazed at how it truly captivates the struggles of the modern day. Although it could be argued that this novel/movie is not so much a tragedy at all and just the story of a broken man. Miller himself argues that a tragedy does not necessarily have to be in the classic aristotelean nor the Shakespearian form where the tragic hero falls from grace. In the Aristotelean and Shakespearian tragedies the tragic hero is always above the reader, a monarch or the like, and falls from his grace due to his hamartia aka tragic flaw. Miller contends that a tragic hero can be any man of any status who in his quest for his perceived rightful position falls because of a misinterpreted identity. The question ""Who am I"" is asked of oneself and for the tragic hero they follow the incorrect path. In the case of Willy Loman his hamartia is his blindness to his true identity. He believes he is a salesman and cannot let go of this dream and accept that ""he's a dime a dozen."" The reason that Willy IS a tragic hero is that in his mistakes Biff comes to the realization that he and his father have both been chasing the wrong dream their entire lives. Unfortunately Willy dies without realizing it himself and Happy is prepared to step back into the vicious cycle created by false perceptions of ones rightful position. Happy says ""I'm staying right here in this city, and I'm gonna beat this racket."" He steps into the same world that his father suffered through. Biff on the other hand realizes his true entelechy and the teleos (end) to which he aspires. This story is so ripping because it is so representative of the sophist and materialistic world we live in today. I'd say the line that hits the deepest chord with the audience is that of Willy in Howard's office: ""You can't eat the orange and throw the peel away - a man is not a piece of fruit!"" Unfortunately for Willy the business world back then and now is a harsh world which strives only for material goods. Biff is the only one who escapes by realizing his true entelechy, he loves to work with his hands, get dirty (no not a porn star), he's meant to do some form of labor whether it be farming or as a construction worker. Though his aspirations to get higher in the chain of being are lowered to a ""mere"" laborer he has realized his vocation. In all the tragedy he is an example of the way to really live life, do what you love not what rewards you best with material goods.",9.0,Strategoi,2005/05/30,15,13
1915,Pulp Fiction,"You and I are passers-by, lonely and boring soul","The narrative of the whole story is ups and downs. Hold the audience's attention very well. Each character has different meanings in different stories and seems to be shaped into different personalities. From beginning to end, the characters haven't changed, but we have seen more of the characters' stories. It can be said that Quentin's understanding of the script and the lens expression has reached a certain height. In fact, from the structure of the film, it is understood by individuals. Ah, echoing from beginning to end, very powerful. Elementary school students know that the composition is echoed from beginning to end, and play in a loop. So to take this bragging, I think it is insulting Quentin's level. When I watch this movie, I see Quentin's understanding of the characters. Gangs, boxing, drugs, underground culture. These things that seem far away from the lives of ordinary people have been put on the screen. The first caught the eye, but it looked vulgar. In fact, the characters have their own principles and abacus. No bad guy is stupid, and no policeman is just. So the whole movie has a lot of dialogue. Dialogue is an important code for explaining information, and it is also an important way for the audience to understand the characters. So Quentin worked hard on the conversation, the conversation in the restaurant, the conversation in the car, the conversation during the murder, etc. All dialogues are expressing the character's character, and not only the dialogue is used to express the speaker's character, but also the dialogue is used to shape the character of a character who has not yet appeared. All these conversations endow the characters with soul. It so happens that they are all interesting souls. In the real world, there are many people who are lonely, and there are few interesting souls. So, how attractive should these people on the screen be to us. And the weird advancement in the story doesn't seem reasonable. But after understanding the dialogue information, all these non-common senses seem to be explained. After all, there are few normal people. It can be said that they are all weird characters. The weird director made great works again. In the end, for the audience, we are all passers-by in the restaurant. We eat in the restaurant while enjoying these stories away from life. The most indispensable group in the world is the group that eats melons. In particular, the more fresh the story, the more we cannot bear our curiosity, and the more I want to know what will happen next. Of course, this is just the appeal of the story. The story comes from the script, so I say the script of this movie is great. Quentin's grasp of the rhythm and structure of the film is excellent. Only under the combined effect of the two, did this excellent work. In short, is the story too exciting, or are we living too ordinary.

As you can see the argument is in broad terms the same you've watched in dozens of movies, the characters are a little bit stereotyped (a good teacher, an evil director, a bad guy that eventually turns into the teacher's best friend...). Anyway, is there anything left to talk about in cinema or in literature? No, there's not. I think almost everything's been told by now. So ""Les choristes"" is not the most original film ever , but the film-making is pretty nice and is full of tender, sense of humor, optimism and good values. It was one of the most successful European movies of the last year, the film everybody's been talking about round here.

Ferris Bueller is the luckiest kid, he skips school one day by faking he is sick and while his parents are gone he gets his friends out of school and they have fun everywhere. Ferris always seems to almost run into his dad or his principal who is looking for him.

Yet this was coming from the female lead so I guess she's right!!! ðŸ˜± sarcasm..

The lead guy tells her she could write a story even better than a celebrated author by adding blood, guts and ritual sacrifice...that makes it better??? Haha...oh we get it ..we're supposed to laugh!!...ritual sacrifice another funny topic...haha After this, it seemed like karma that the guy, who instigated all this, was dying in an especially miserable way...I was thinking..see, Mr self righteous..show intolerance and you suffer!...but I think the director missed this irony... The last message ran throughout and was nihilistic on the extreme constant assertions that there's nothing after this life because their miserable disease wouldn't be allowed by a caring God, and yet also preaching about how beautiful their love was..hint..show it, Mr director don't preach it...anyway if it was just a 1 year blip in a dying works where everything just ceases to exist..then how meaningful was it anyway??

Set as a seemingly regular college-movie, it quickly transforms into a something much bigger with Broderick's Ferris becoming an almost mythical character, able to perform and get away with anything. As usual, the film is packed with the Hughesian trademark of subtle, yet clever, jokes, requiring some viewing to grasp. Hughes clearly had a great time with this movie (as did the cast) which adds to the general delight of watching the movie. Add some great performances by Jennifer Grey and Jeffrey Jones (and a killer Ferrari), FBDO is a movie to watch over and over again.

1922,October Sky,A Sky for All Seasons- Touching American Piece ****,"A true wholesome American story about teenagers who are interested in launching their own rocket in a rural West Virginia coal mining town, after the launch of Sputnik in 1957. Through trial, tribulations and perseverance beyond belief, they are ultimately able to achieve their goals. Jake Gyllenhaal, as the leader of the group, is excellent in the title role. As his motivating science teacher, Laura Linney is quite good but her southern accent is over the top. There is a standout supporting performance by Chris Cooper, a head miner, who wants his son to follow in his footsteps, but gradually comes around at film's end. What makes this film so unusual for our times is that there are no bed-hopping scenes and no profanity whatsoever. It is the epitome of an American story that is well done. Besides the science angle, we have the father-son disagreement, football scholarships as a way to escape coal mining, and the loving spirit of family.

1924,Hotel Transylvania,Great animated movie with all the classic movie monsters...,"""Hotel Transylvania"" really surprised me in a good way. I was a little bit concerned about taking all the classic movie monsters and put them together in an animated movie. But this really turned out to be a great experience. The animation is really great and the characters are so unique and memorable, and they have just the right amount of Tim Burton-touch to them without being too much copies of his usual style of art. There is a lot of great details to the characters and they all really have their own personalities and characteristics. But not only the characters were amazingly detailed, the scenery, settings and surroundings were also nicely fleshed out and brought to life on the screen. As for the story, well then director Genndy Tartakovsky managed to put a great story together and execute it nicely on the screen. You are instantly sucked in and drawn deep into the storyline and bond with many of the characters. The story itself is about Count Dracula who is running a hotel in the middle of a dark, scary and haunted forest; a hotel for monsters only. However, a human appears on the threshold of the monster hotel one day. And as if a human visitor wasn't enough for the count to deal with, then his daughter was also coming of age and was showing an alarming interest in the world outside the hotel; the world of the living. ""Hotel Transylvania"" has a pretty impressive list of people on the cast list, and they are doing really good jobs with the voice acting. Personally, I really enjoyed Steve Buscemi (as Wayne), Kevin James (as Frankenstein) and Fran Drescher (as Eunice). But the rest of the cast were also doing great jobs. ""Hotel Transylvania"" is a nice animated movie that is enjoyable for both youngsters and us older people as well. I enjoyed it because it had a funny story, was stuffed with great animation and it had that semi-goth feel to it and dealt with all the movie monsters that I grew up with and loved then and love today as well.",8.0,paul_haakonsen,2013/01/08,8,4
1925,The Fault in Our Stars,One word .... nauseating,"I cannot believe that this tripe has 8.5. I was unfortunate enough to accompany two 15 year old girls with my friend and was shocked that girls that age want to waste their time sobbing uncontrollably on a Friday evening when there is a whole world out there waiting for them. The acting .... Oh my gosh .... The worst I've ever seen. Gus was unbearable, smug and frankly creepy. And as for her mother - patronizing is an understatement! I just struggled to watch them all make fools of themselves in this silly, ridiculous film. What rubbish are we feeding our teens? We had to point out to my friend's daughter who thought Gus was such a catch that life just isn't like this. During the movie one girl clattered noisily out the cinema strangled by sobs and the row in front of us shook with heart-wrenching wails as my friend and I shook with laughter. Get real kids. Don't waste your time watching this trite pap, get out into the sunshine and LIVE or at least watch a decent movie with a believable storyline and great acting, something that will resonate or affect you deeply ...... Because this certainly isn't worthy of anybody's valuable time.",1.0,carolinemarks1560-34-154252,2014/06/22,253,126
1926,Hotel Transylvania,And I Thought The Monster Squad was Childish,"I'm sure plenty of children and families adore ""Hotel Transylvania,"" but not every animated kiddie movie is without intelligence, so I'm not going to cut it any slack. Another animated monster kids movie, Pixar's ""Monster's, Inc."" (2001), for instance, is kind of clever in its use of doors to multiple universes. And, although not animated, ""The Monster Squad"" (1987) manages to pay homage to classic monster movies and remain charming despite some childish humor. ""Hotel Transylvania"" features many of the same monsters as that film and more, including Dracula and his daughter, Frankenstein and his bride, werewolves, mummies, an invisible man, a gillman and Quasimodo, but they've basically nothing to do with their sources in novels or prior movies. They're more akin to the monster cereals, such as Count Chocula and Frenken Berry--mere caricatures, overly sweet and not very good for you. In ""Hotel Transylvania,"" Dracula has clipped the wings, so to speak, of his bat daughter, but he must learn to allow her to fly the coop. He also runs a hotel for monsters. The Dracula of ""Nocturna"" (1979) did the same thing, the film also had plenty of music like this one (except it was disco), and Dracula's daughter fell in love with a human. The similarities stop there, though, since ""Nocturna"" also had gratuitous nudity and an old Dracula complaining about how his reproductive organs don't work as well anymore (although, here, the Invisible Man defends the size of his in one pool-side gag). ""Hotel Transylvania,"" on the other hand, has Count-less butt jokes, including a fart that's let on fire. I'm not sure which is worse, but I know fire is bad. There's a joke at the expense of the ""Twilight"" series, where Dracula sardonically remarks, ""This is how we're represented."" Right back at you, Count Chocula; ""Hotel Transylvania"" isn't fang-tastic, either. Nor had I ever heard Dracula say ""blah blah blah,"" and I've seen well over 50 Dracula movies since reading Bram Stoker's novel. Perhaps, the worst caricature of all, though, is Quasimodo as the hotel chef. Why is he a chef? Because he's French, I guess. That's racist. Anyways, the movie wraps up like a bad rom-com but replaces the father for the girl or boy chasing down the other for a grand romantic gesture. It's kind of like ""The Wedding Singer"" (1998) and with the same actor. Another quibble I have with this movie is that when they list off Dracula's vulnerabilities--sunlight, garlic, stakes to the heart--they don't mention crosses. I get that they threw out all of the sex and violence from Dracula--even though that was most of Stoker's book--it's a kid's movie, after all. But the religion? I think that was a shrewd commercial move to avoid offending any audience, except for maybe cranky old Dracula buffs like me. But, they've made millions of dollars off this franchise and, as of this writing, about to release the third movie installment, so they know what they're doing. I don't have to like it, though. (Mirror Note: No mirror shots in this Dracula movie, either.)",4.0,Cineanalyst,2018/07/10,1,1
1927,The Wailing,"The good, the bad, and the awful","First of all, Hong-jin Na is the man; this is an amazing film and may be one of the best horrors of the last ten years--which may be saying more about the genre than the film. I think I can do this without spoiling. If you don't know what style underpants Japanese and Korean men wear, or which side of the road they drive on, not to mention who gets to cast the first stone or how many times a rooster burps, you might not 'get' this film. Religion is a spongy thing, from Shamans to the resurrected, and from scamming palm readers to the truly omniscient, they all speak and act ambiguously. So there's that. Kudos to start: The Shaman rituals are wonderful and intense, the music is so good. The zombie scene, just WOW, even though it teeters close to ""okay, there's six of us and one of him, lets try to get him one at a time"" dumbness. Kwak Do-Won, like so many of the blubbery Korean actors I enjoy, is great with only a few errors, probably the director's fault. The little girl really does ""bring it"". Jun Kunimura, though problematic overall as the 'Japanese' man, has a couple scenes of such commitment and beauty (the photographers, makeup people, and director get some credit) my jaw hit the floor. One eyebrow raised: Films of subtle depth and substance should also be enjoyable on a superficial level to be great. This film is that, for the most part. BUT. There's a fine line between intentionally misdirecting your audience and being thoughtfully ambiguous. Hong-jin Na is a little wobbly on that line. I think this is the weakest of his three films. The film is edited questionably. There are several scenes that all of a sudden aren't there any more and we're onto/into the next one leaving us to think: ""How did they get out of that one""? This can be an effective technique or a sign that things haven't been thought through completely. This film isn't very fluid, imo. Spankings: In the horror genre, or otherwise, it's disappointing when there's a scary scene that ends up being a dream--doubly so if someone later asks 'Was it a dream?' or says with authority: 'It wasn't a dream'. There's a big scary scene that happens in this flick that just doesn't make sense for it to convert to a dream, unless the guy woke up where he was in the dream. It invalidates what happened right before it and during it. The foot chase. This is a staple of many horrors and others. It's akin to the gun fight: stupid. When a hobbled old man, shown stumbling and falling down, can still outrun six capable, younger men, I'm gonna puke. I might even punt a film based on that, as this makes me lose lots of respect for the film maker and his/her choices. Back to the underpants. I'm sure there are lots of 'tells' in the film I didn't get. Lots of them. But and So, even missing all of them, and even though I ask for an obvious 'tell' if/when the subtleties may be lost, the big obvious 'reveal' in this film is so clumsy I felt a big ""Boo"" well up from inside. I'm on board with a film that might not make sense, might even frustrate while experiencing it in real time, and only reveals its true depth after it's over and you think about it and put all the puzzle pieces together. An example would be *Spider Forest*, a film I totally didn't 'get' while I was watching it, but felt enthused and excited about trying to make sense of it. When The Wailing ended I was glad it was over. Don't get me started on the ""Why is this happening?"" question. You really have to make stuff up for the answer in the film to that question to make sense.",8.0,sitenoise,2016/09/20,12,4
1928,Interstellar,A cinematic mess!,"This film is an example of having to many irons in the fire and not knowing what to do with them, which results in an over sentimental mess that is called Interstellar. Nolan finally shows clearly his hubris in that he thinks of himself as a cinematic mastermind, in fact he's just a Hollywood pet with cheap tricks. There is nothing wrong in getting the science incorrect, a competent filmmaker manages to work around the incoherence and still create a unified whole, Nolan on the other hand wants us to think that he understands the science behind Interstellar, but he also shows clearly that he doesn't put much trust in the audiences' intellect. This results in an over abundance of exposition which is there just to inform us of how stupid we are. The sentimentality, which is most of the time laughable, doesn't go along with the overall structure of the film because the plot is disorganized. The problem comes from the inability to transform a concept into a film without allowing the audience to interpret what they are seeing - instead Nolan tries to overwhelm us with his elitist vision and it comes out as a mess because he doesn't trust his audience, he's lack of vision doesn't come from him not having a concept but from the inability to mediate that concept through a film, in other words: he is a bad filmmaker.",3.0,antonie4,2014/11/11,127,60
1929,The Green Mile,"The Green Mile (1999) - Three Hours of Circus Mice, Electric Chairs, and Dry Sponges!","Frank Darabont, the extraordinary director of the hit ""Shawshank Redemption"", comes back to the big screen with yet another adaptation of another prison drama novel by Stephen King. This time, the story is ""The Green Mile"", and this time he has the help of Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan joining a powerful cast that also includes Bonnie Hunt, Michael Jeter, and Sam Rockwell. The movie stars Hanks as Paul Edgecomb, an officer on death row, with a serious bladder infection, who rounds up a new suspect named John Coffey, portrayed by Michael Clarke Duncan, a man with mysterious immortality powers, that may have been accused for the raping and killing of two innocent girls. The movie follows as a dramatic and entertaining tale of hope, faith, and courage. Darabont brings back the lucky charm used in ""Shawshank"", but this time he combines real life with fantasy, and creates a story of miracles and dreams. Anyways, the film has powerful backgrounds, and the film focuses on the story with lots of drama and thrills, and the script is more well-written since Shawshank was well-written. The special effects are amazingly realistic, and the story is like a special charm from the heart. I really enjoyed this film, and it's fun to watch it again and again. You will enjoy it so much, you will start to wonder where the 3-hour running time has gone.

1930,The Green Mile,"This movie blew me away, made me laugh, made me cry and me truly understand what the term 'sad' meant","Until I saw 'the Green Mile', I always thought that the 'Shawshank Redemption' and 'Forrest Gump' were the two saddest movies that I ever saw, but this movie actually blew me away for good. 'The Green Mile' tells the tale of a few prison officers whose life changes when a supposed rapist/murderer gets sent to the prison they are in. During this time, they come to realize that he has a mysterious power that can be used for good and that the man may truly be innocent of all accused crimes. I love every single thing about 'the Green Mile', the same way I loved everything about 'The Shawshank Redemption' and 'Forrest Gump'. The acting in the movie was just perfected on all corners. Tom Hanks brilliantly portrays the complex character of Paul Edgecomb and the late Michael Clarke Duncan absolutely steals the show in an Oscar robbed performance as John Coffey. May he ever rest in peace. It wasn't, however, just those two who gave strong performances. The actors playing Brutus, Hal, Del, Percy, Wharton all did an unbelievable job at portraying how realistic prison life may truly be. The story is so emotionally moving that it is impossible to not like and connect with. The characters presented in the movie are some of the finest movie characters that I've ever seen. This film truly mastered characters and what they undergo during prison life. The directing and writing by Frank Darabont, the man behind 'The Shawshank Redemption' absolutely masters everything a film needs to get right once more and adds such layers to each character that we come to truly love by the end of the film. The tone to the movie is so dark that we are immediately thrown into the world presented in this movie. The movie is so sad on many occasions that I was truly left bawling my eyes out. **Spoilers*** The scene where Del is horribly executed to death was just too sad to look at. This movie made me sympathize with criminals more than any other movie. The last half hour made me truly cry all the way through it. The film doesn't attempt to out do itself and just masters it all. The ending to the movie just continued to make me cry. John Coffey's death is perhaps, the saddest death I've ever seen in movie history. It was such a moving scene that truly made me think twice about life. ***Spoilers ended*** 'The Green Mile' is a superbly acted, directed, written movie with fascinating characters and a moving story that is sure to make everyone cry and be totally glad that they saw this movie. I however, do not think I will ever sit through this 3 hour movie, as I cannot bear to be emotionally connected to these characters. Watching 'The Green Mile' again and again is not easy, but that's a good thing about the movie.",10.0,illbebackreviews,2013/02/16,14,11
1931,Moon,"catchy, moody, expensive....","Saw lot's of trailers and posters for this, and have been looking forward to seeing it. I'm a big fan of odyssey, and think solaris is a great trip. This film starts out comparing itself with odyssey (greatest film period) and solaris (very odyssey inspired), then calling it ""one of those rare space gems"". They've made a great soundtrack, spend millions on props and actors. And then....nothing...No, seriously, absolutely nothing. One actor (except when there's two or three of him), the weakest story and plot ever (a five-year-old could think of this). NOT in any way clever or inventive, just tedious and dumb. I suppose some people think ""aah.. a sophisticated scifi experience, maybe even space-opera like, we can discuss seriously, while smoking cigars and sipping whine"" - I can only say: AAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH you've been had! Sorry Hollywood, you can't just steal all the props and ideas from other movies, without adding something yourselves. Throw away that ""random story generator"" and THINK for a change.

1932,Crash,An Utter Disappointment,"Devoid of any subtlety whatsoever, CRASH purports to portray the state of race relations in Los Angeles. Well, if CRASH were indeed accurate with respect to its depiction of race relations in Los Angeles, with which the Academy voters seem to agree, then I sure am glad I live in New York City. Extremely didactic and bombastic, CRASH has reduced racial politics into diluted, mind numbing stereotypes and extremely broadly written characters that are nothing more than caricatures. CRASH takes the easy way out, does not, and indeed cannot, with its large number of players on its canvas, delve into character complexities or at least try to mimic, if not actually depict, the way real people deal with racism. Among its embarrassment of extremely unrealistic scenes (and the film is replete with them), a rich, well-mannered white woman (of the noblesse oblige variety) hurled insults at a Latino locksmith who is changing the lock of her front door and, within his earshot, accused him of planning to sell the key as soon as he gets the opportunity to do so. What instead would have been realistic was for this character to express her concerns to her white husband a couple of rooms away in their large luxury home with no one else in the room. Such white woman is somehow redeemable from this faux pas with the Latino locksmith because cheap redemptions abound in this movie: this rich white woman later slips down the stairs and, lo and behold, the only one who tended to her injuries was her Latina maid. And just like that, the rich white woman declared that her Latina maid, whose services were paid for by her and her husband, was her ""best friend."" Presto! Her earlier treatment of the locksmith is forgiven. The film also places up front and center a white racist cop who also happens to be his father's caretaker. He treats black people like 3rd class citizens, but Paul Haggis would almost make it seem that this character's racist attitudes were balanced out by his having to care for his father. I would further argue that Haggis posits that racism is excusable when one has other personal concerns in his or her life, and that is simply indefensible. Racism cannot be excused by one's family duties, no matter how overwhelming they may be. And, as with the white woman mentioned above, a cheap redemption also awaits this white racist cop. A black woman he earlier molests in front of her black husband is caught in a car about to explode. And who comes to this woman's rescue, well it's none other than this racist-molesting cop! And at the end of this sequence, we are supposed to feel sympathy for this cop, when arguably it is a combination of his duty as a cop as well as his instinct of self-preservation (after all he was in the car that was about to explode with the black woman he earlier molested) that truly motivated his ""heroic"" efforts. Racism is not reducible to mere black and white. Racist cops are nothing novel: just recall the Rodney King case, the Abner Louima scandal and the Amadou Diallo news stories. Racism in the real world, or at least the world that is outside the bubble that is Los Angeles, however, festers beneath the surface, is much more subtle and covert. It's when I used to walk around the malls as a teenager and was constantly followed by the security guards and sales staff asking me if I needed assistance, while white kids roamed about the store free from the prying eyes and intrusive conduct of store management. They are comments passed seemingly innocuously by people who tell me that they could never tell between Japanese, Chinese, Filipinos and other Southeast Asians because they all look the same. It's when people assume that no black person who works as a secretary or receptionist could ever speak non-broken English. And subtleties like these are what CRASH is glaringly missing. In this day and age, if there is one thing we do with respect to this most sensitive of topics, we DO NOT vocalize our misconceptions/beliefs toward certain races and minorities absent heated confrontations or inebriated/altered states, and, more importantly, shout out these beliefs within the presence or earshot of members of the aforementioned groups. CRASH would have us believe that everyone walks around so wound up and ready to lash out a racial epithet to anyone and everyone whose skin color and/or cultural background happen to be different from yours: be it your girlfriend, someone you got into a car accident with, your hired help, and policemen in the guise of performing their civic and professional duties. And if Haggis really wanted to portray ""duality"" in that everyone has good and bad within them, then why did he carve out exceptions for Asians, as exemplified by the film's Asian male character and his wife, who the film deemed as the ONLY irredeemable characters in the its throughline? CRASH has dumbed down racism to the point that if someone tells me they feel like they learned something about themselves from viewing the film, I feel nothing but pity for them because they obviously have not experienced racism and they either live in an extremely homogeneous society or not in the real world at all. There is nothing novel about CRASH, and there are no lessons to be learned from it that are not self-evident when one just steps outside one's home. CRASH fails in every way possible to show accurately racism and the true evil it is. Racism is complicated and for a project this ambitious, CRASH should not have been rewarded with the Best Picture Oscar especially when it failed in all respects--artistically, technically and otherwise--from achieving its, admittedly, lofty goals.",1.0,jsg03jd,2006/04/02,103,60

1935,The Wailing,Beware The Wailing! This film will stick with you,"The Wailing opens with a quote from the bible. It is easy to forget this fact while watching most of the film, but at a certain point it becomes clear the purpose that quote served. It is almost like a warning: ""if you are a religious person, this film will scare every part of you."" This is where The Wailing works so well. As a religious parable, it overcomes its lengthy running time and tonal imbalance, to deliver an often funny but truly terrifying film. When a mysterious stranger moves to a small village in South Korea, the village becomes plagued by sickness. The police think a wild mushroom is to blame, but police officer Jong-goo thinks it may have something to do with the stranger. He meets a woman who gives him some information about this mysterious man, and slowly begins to fall down a rabbit hole that consumes his life. When his daughter starts to show signs of the sickness, it gets personal and he must figure out who to trust and who to avoid. The director, Hong-jin Na, struggles to find a good tonal balance. At times pitch perfect and at other times all over the place, the tone struggles to stay consistent. For the first third of the film, it is primarily a funny movie with briefs bursts of depravity and violence. The comedy works well and I found myself laughing a number of times. Then when the horrific imagery would come up it was sudden and effective. There was a good balance here that gets lost in the second act. The comedy becomes more slapstick and does not fit with the rest of the film. The characters also become over-the-top and act in exaggerated ways very different from how they were introduced. This middle section also has some moments of unintentional humor. One example sees a man struck by lightening and another has the caller ID for a shaman come up on the phone as ""Shaman"". Fortunately it finds a good balance again in the third act, but smartly switches it up from the first act. It becomes intense and terrifying with a few moments of comedy to offset the horror. And what a terrifying last act it is. As everything starts to unfold, the audience gains a new appreciation of the rest of the film and starts to reinterpret certain scenes. The only problem is that a few of these scenes only made sense once the film ended. Rather than feeling natural and fitting in as the story progressed, they required the ending to actually make sense. At 2 hours and 36 minutes, the film is just too long. The middle portion of the film is where this could have been resolved. The shaman had too much screen time performing various rituals that ended up not being very important. There was also a 'zombie' scene that felt awkward and didn't fit in with the rest of the movie. It seemed as though they wanted to put a zombie in the film just because of their growing popularity. This scene also brings in a number of random characters that serve no purpose in the rest of the film. Despite a few scenes with the previously mentioned overacting, the acting generally speaking is fantastic. The father tasked with solving whatever is happening to his daughter, conveys the terror and hatred he is building up with an intense persona he carries throughout the film. A priest in training who comes in to give advice on what the father should do is equally effective. He brings a concerned and innocent quality to the terror that will ultimately happen. But it is the young daughter who gets sick, that really shines. Channeling her inner Linda Blair, she emphatically delivers horrible, dirty lines that no child should ever say. Her performance is truly terrifying as you watch the hatred in her eyes slowly take over. As the film comes to an end, the religious overtones become clearer. Locusts attack an individual. White and black are used to suggest character's true nature. And it is in these scenes where the film truly shines. By slowly unveiling the real nature of certain characters, the last 45 minutes of the movie will change your perspective on the whole thing. Every few minutes you will switch sides when trying to determine whom to trust and only when the big reveal comes do you realize how detailed the setup to get there was. The reveal really puts a twist on everything that led up to it and the film ultimately becomes about the horrors of putting your faith in the wrong people.

1937,Interstellar,"Dumb, dumber, dumbest!","This is without exception one of the dumbest films I have ever sat through. Or perhaps it's a masterpiece and I'm too dumb to understand it? Anyway ..... Here are some of the things (the list is not exhaustive) that I could not get my head around. There is a catastrophic failure in most of the crops of the world. And the entire scientific community simply shrugs and says, 'Oh well. Dem's the breaks' and does nothing. Seriously? Apart from that one dude in the 'super secret' NASA compound? Okay then. A super intelligent, super advanced alien civilization has been watching us. They see that the planet is in peril. That more than six thousand million people will die from starvation. So they offer a solution. Not by curing the blight mind. No, that would be far too easy. They construct a wormhole (they being five dimensional creatures 'n' all) close to Saturn ('cos Kubrick had already used Jupiter in 2001). The film makes a big deal about corn being the only viable crop still resisting the blight (cornmash beer anybody) but it's only a matter of time before that too succumbs. So It's a matter of great urgency that the astro-heroes get to the ol' wormhole as quickly as possible. So the far side of the Moon would be a handy place to put it. No, no, noooo. They place the wormhole beside Saturn. So distant from Earth that it takes two years just to fly there. And all the while any poor kids unfortunate enough to be called Dusty are getting the crap beaten out of them at Pharming College. Anybody for cornflakes? Now NASA have already explored the wormhole. They know that it opens into another galaxy, beside a black hole and an assortment of potential new worlds. Because of the proximity of the planets to the black hole, time will be distorted and a couple of hours exploring these new worlds will translate to decades back on Earth. While back on ol' Planet earth the corn crops fail and the dust storms gather pace. So this was the plan? By the super intelligent aliens? Is someone taking the p*ss? There were no planets anywhere that were ... um ... NOT right beside a black hole? Super intelligent? Doh! And so finally, after a number of silly subplots, our hero finally descends onto the event horizon of the black hole (My God! It's full of stars?). And experiences time as a physical construct. But is he shown the origin of the blight that is wiping out the planet so that he might alert the scientific community? Hell no. He is shown his daughter's bedroom on the day that he left on his 'weekend getaway.' We see him getting really upset that his daughter isn't picking up on his STAY ...... STAY! gravity assisted message, even though he should remember that she shouted STAY .... STAY! to him on that day, and he left anyway. Sheesh! And Zimmer's soundtrack? I hadn't heard about the soundtrack request came to him via email, without him ever seeing the movie. Explains a lot really. Presumably the email went something like 'If you produce anything orchestral like Kubrick, you're off the project.' So the soundtrack consisted almost entirely of ponderous bass heavy synth driven (in the cinema where I watched it) piercingly loud quasi classical discordance. Bear in mind that Kubrick chose the pieces by Strauss, etc., to assist him in editing the movie,and then realised that they actually fit perfectly, and so discarded the original soundtrack that he had commissioned. Not Nolan. NoSirreeBob! Email it in, Hans. Who listens to the music anyway? Deeply, deeply disappointing. And I loved Inception!",1.0,max_tout,2014/11/18,885,391
1938,Pulp Fiction,Easy to recommend,"Praise for this movie is abundant in media, and rightfully so. Pulp Fiction is one of the most fun and satisfying movies I've ever watched. Being a Tarantino movie, its characters and dialogue are top notch. This is probably the #1 movie I would recommend to someone (if they haven't seen it) as it's very easy to get into and you can just let go of reality and be sucked into the film.",10.0,greatbun,2020/08/06,3,3

1940,Detachment,A Masterpiece,"I saw this originally in a theater and then again on VOD. I loved it right off and rated it a 9, but it was a movie I just couldn't get off my mind. The cast was outstanding, especially Brody, and the one that kept bringing my thoughts back to it, Toni Gayle as Erica in her first feature film performance. As the director Tony Kaye said, hers was the first character he cast because she is the central pin for the story--amazing given a cast loaded with familiar faces and names and incredible talent. I can't say too much about the story without spoiling it. It does have memorable dialogue, a very interesting story, and humor is not absent but I think is suffers with audiences because the central character, Brody, is a deep person with a lot to offer but is stuck in a sad, shallow outward personality. If I'd had to leave before the end, I might well not have gone back to finish it. Others have watched it thinking it was going to be another ""American History X"", but they're just two different movies, both with something big to say, this more so even than X in my opinion. My only minuscule nit to pick is I'd rather have had Brody do the head shots as voice over narration. Above all, if I didn't say anything else I'd say this....stick with it. The only flaw associated with this movie given all is positives is criminally atrocious marketing. It's like displaying Van Gogh's ""Starry Night"" in the basement of the Museum of Modern Art where only the occasional patron wanders in and happens to lift its covering. To help the reader judge how I weigh film ratings, I've seen between 5-10,000 movies, but this is only my 14th 10/10.",10.0,Stewball,2012/04/19,63,53
1941,Pulp Fiction,Flat and Brainless,"As a 13 year old just getting into cinema, this was the best film ever. How could I not be blown away by all the clever dialog, great characters, fantastic storyline, and gripping violence. It was just pure heaven. I saw this movie three times in the course of one year, and I still have such fond memories of watching it. It was around the time I got serious about cinema (about two years later) that I felt I needed to give this another go. I'd discovered the works of Bergman, Tarkovsky, Godard,etc, and felt a connection with film in ways I hadn't before, and I wanted to see if the movies I loved before still held up. I had every intention of loving ""Pulp Fiction"" just as much as I did back then, but I didn't. There was nothing there, no core. All the things I'd loved about it were gone. That clever dialog? Referential nonsense that gave no insight into who I was watching or attempted to expand the narrative. The great characters? Indistinctive cardboard cutouts that act as mouthpieces for Tarintino. Fantastic storyline? A pseudo throwback to film noir that can't decide whether it wants to take itself seriously or be intentionally stupid for the sake of irony. Gripping violence? It's violence that's harsh enough to put the average viewer in awe, safe enough as to not offend. It's a dead film with no ideas. A common argument I hear in it's favor is that it's somehow objectively entertaining. Why? Because it has guys with guns and monologues about McDonalds? Sorry, but that's not entertainment in my mind. Entertainment is being engaged, having to think. A film like ""Andrei Rublev"" is entertaining because, while I watch it, it evokes thought and feeling, it has something I can sink my teeth into. I can still think about it, interpret it in different ways. ""Pulp Fiction"" is just shutting your brain off for two and half hours while a man with a God complex strokes his ego. Basically, I can understand to some extent why it is so popular. It's very good at pleasing the masses, something Tarkovsky could never do. It's so perfectly designed to hook the average viewer in. But it's paper thin. This is exactly what I don't want in cinema",1.0,mtthwibrahim,2012/07/28,133,58
1942,Ferris Bueller's Day Off,A good movie for high schoolers.,"Ferris Buehler's Day Off is one of my favorite John Hughes movies. Matthew Broderick as Ferris Buehler puts in a classic eighties performance as the lovable slacker. Chicago has never looked better. After ditching school the movie takes all kinds of improbable twists and turns, each one more funny than the last. Definitely John Hughes's best movie, Ferris Buehler's Day Off has many memorable scenes, my favorite being when Edward Rooney (the villainous principal in search of Ferris...) walks into a bar with a television set playing the same Cub's Game that Ferris is ditching school to attend. The movie then cuts to Ferris at the Wrigley Field catching a baseball laughing about how much better it is to go to a baseball game than it is to go to P.E. That scene always cracks me up.",,DannyDineen,2004/11/10,1,1
1943,Goodfellas,So what's all the fuss about then?,"I bought this film on DVD on the strength of two things - one, de Niro's excellent track record, and two, the very high rating on IMDB (in the Top 50). Having watched it, I have to ask what all the fuss is about? This is a very ordinary film which explores at extreme length the intimate details of the lives of the most childish individuals ever committed to celluloid. Whether or not people like these really exist, I found it completely uninteresting. I have no idea why so many people are fascinated by the mafia - maybe it's envy of the power - but they should not hold a fascination for civilised human beings. People who deal out death as a punishment for the slightest reverse in their lives deserve to be ignored or reprimanded, not lauded and celebrated as in this film. For every Henry Hill, there are a thousand or more kept in poverty because of the crime which supports his odious lifestyle. It would be nice to think there was some kind of a moral ending, but even then, we see Henry selling out his colleagues just to keep himself somewhere nearer the feeding trough. How anyone can rate this film so highly is beyond me; how so many of you IMDB browsers can and do, just beggars belief!",6.0,richard_peers,2003/02/21,234,100
1944,The Fault in Our Stars,Realistic?,"For the type of movie this is, it's not half bad. Slow moving at times and some the the dialogue doesn't ring true. Sad tale of two young people who have cancer....not a comedy for sure. Depressing in fact. Well acted by the leads and especially Laura Dern as the mother. Wonderful performance and wanted to see more of her. As a realist and difficult to take 'theatrical' license, I'm wondering how Gus and Issac got to that church toward the end. Issac is blind and Gus is dying and in a wheel chair. How in the world did the get to and from the church??? Would have been more realistic if one of Gus' parents had been sitting in the back somewhere. Then you'd know how the two boys got there. Also, at the end when the mother tells Hazel that someone is here to see you. It's Issac. How did he get to the house. Just little quibbles like this kind of spoil the whole thing.",5.0,ron-fernandez-pittsburgh,2014/12/17,5,3
1945,The Fault in Our Stars,The best film I've seen.,"Without me blabbering on, I would like to give my complements to John Green and his Team. The Fault In Our Stars is a fantastic book which has a really sad ending (I'm not going to say it to you). As the quote says ""Some Infinities are bigger than others"" however, Hazel and Gus's love was quite an extraordinary one. It must of been hard living with Cancer. The book was different, but it still had the same story to the film but with more parts. I got the book after the film came out so my book has the photos in it. I have to say I did cry at the end but I couldn't stop blabbering through the film. Too be honest, Hazel Grace has inspired me. Not everything in life is perfect and people are dying, this book showed the good and bad sides to cancer. Like the book says, pain demands to be felt. It touched my sad side. This book is one of the best. Thank you.",10.0,robyndolls2859,2014/07/07,66,37

Maybe this was a good film back in 1986 but now it look very dated . Perhaps this led way for all the teen comedies we see far to many of these days, if so, it has a lot to answer for. Perhaps i am being a little harsh because really it isnt that bad but top 100? no way!

1948,Moon,Nicely done,"Just saw this multi-layered drama and was very impressed. Sam Rockwell, who is Oscar-worthy on this one, is a lone worker on the Moon, mining for what turns into energy on Earth. We see his daily life and the toll it takes. Although the entire film is very strong, this period of the story is the weakest. Frankly, it raises too many logistical questions to elevate it to a 10. After having a couple of visions (that prove to be of no relevance), he crashes into one of the mining vessels. He then wakes up in the infirmary of his base and is nursed back to health by the companion robot, voiced by Kevin Spacey. Finally the story kicks in when Sam sneaks out and goes back to the site of his crash and finds---HIMSELF! Taking the person back, this 2nd Sam is nursed back to health. The two then have to figure out their dilemma and what exactly is going on during the body of the film. The relationship between the two Sams was a fresh, low-key direction vs. the predictable. It sparks a lot of questions of one's relevance and the value of life itself. There is a new look of fear and mortality in this movie. It presents a very scary ""what if?""",9.0,ritera1,2009/06/28,10,5

Well the story buildup was nice & catchy but as the movie proceed, you start seeing the flaws in the story.

Sadly this film doesn't have Billy's dancing. Homer's rockets are good, but not as much fun. But the film works, mainly because of Jake G's performance.

1951,The Green Mile,What a gem....,"Having doubts about seeing this movie because of the length (3 hours can be death to a film).I was so surprised that I didn't look at my watch once throughout the whole movie. Tom Hanks, in my opinion, gave the performance of his career by bringing emotion and depth to his part. The only actor that bettered him was Michael Clarke Duncan. How he made this giant like character into a vulnerable pussycat was a marvel. On whole, the cast came together and gave the best performance I have seen in a movie for a long time. Not one of them let the side down by being weak. David Morse who is more known for his supporting roles was also excellent and hopefully not long till he's carrying his own movie. If you haven't seen this get it out now,forget about the running time and connections to 'The Shawshank Redemption' and enjoy it for what it is, a little miracle. 4 out of 5",8.0,snexy,2001/10/10,233,173

1954,Hotel Transylvania,Adam Sandler was a good choice.,"Cee-Lo Green wasn't though. This movie got more and more silly and ridiculous as it went, much like a snowball made of humor. But then it fell and landed on me, which wasn't that fun. All the main casting was excellent, although the shrunken heads weren't Whoopi Goldberg like I thought, but an impostor. Sandler was great, casting Selena Gomez was pretty smart, and Andy Samberg was goofy. This makes the second movie in a row Samberg and Sandler have worked on together, but I like to ignore the first one. As to why I didn't like this movie... Cee Lo sings with auto-tune, and Sandler raps. Yes, he raps. The two real-world songs they used were by LMFAO, and that's not how I want this generation to be remembered by. But I saw it in a theater filled with kids, and they say more about than I can. It's a good movie, and I'm glad the 3D wasn't too annoying. (There are plenty of good adult jokes too.)

Les Choristes invites our understanding of their sensibility, sensitivity, and the ease with which they are treated badly -- in fact, have always been treated badly by institutions, educators and parents. The importance of fathers in their lives and their great need for a surrogate if the natural fathers are missing are beautifully explored in this film. The screenplay and its realization on screen are very effective in showing how the difficult combination of giving boys strong direction and tenderness and finding a way to their hearts can be accomplished. This film helps us understand how the same human creature can be hard and sullen one moment and sweetly spiritual the next, inaccessible one minute and needy the next. It is also an inspiring film for young men preparing to be teachers.",10.0,mgphd,2005/01/14,69,55
1956,The Wailing,Wailing of the Beast,"This review of The Wailing is spoiler free **** (4/5) AFTER HIS STUNNINGLY and shockingly assured debut, The Chaser back in 2008 which finally dimmed the burning candle that was left alight after The Silence of the Lambs shocked audiences, and after his grim, gripping and excruciatingly violent crime thriller The Yellow Sea. Korean writer/director Na Hong-jin turns to horror which has a rather ambitious mixture of police procedural drama, part visceral and demonic horror, sometimes hilarious black comedy with a couple of laugh out loud parts, and finally part socio-theological allegory as you're trying to figure out some of the more difficult and somewhat confusing parts of this clever screenplay which leads to a shocking mystery towards the end. The Wailing opens with Jong Goo (Do Won Kwak) a police officer enjoying his daily job and living happily in his rural home with his wife and spirited young daughter, it seems that life for him could not get any better and he couldn't ask for anything more. But when a spate of brutal and violent murders start to wreak havoc all over this quiet suburb, the media blame wild poisonous mushrooms that have suddenly started growing all over the place, but Jong isn't convinced as he hears news that an elderly man has just moved into the area after spending time in Japan and so he starts to suspect that the stranger is the cause of this mysterious illness. But as soon as he suspects this he starts to suffer from endless nightmares and has feelings of insomnia and his family start to worry as it is ruining his life. But suddenly his daughter becomes heavily ill and he thinks that she is going to die as he has seen the result of what happens when others get this illness so it is his job to seek help as he wants to save her from the brunt of this terrible illness, but he soon finds out that it isn't an illness it is just a possession from a ghostly presence. At the start of the second act he and his colleagues search the house of the elderly man and they find something so shocking which brings a new edge to the story as it becomes a rather bellowing dark thriller, but the investigation goes wrong when he thinks he finds something that belongs to his daughter but she soon denies it in her possessed state. Until Jong seeks the help of Il-Gwang (Hwang Jong-min) the village shaman, unfortunately the film starts to flag a little during the second act perhaps due to the excessive time spent on the exorcism ritual, but it's essential stuff as this is used for setting up a third and final which leads a finale which is both genuinely shocking and ingeniously inevitable, as this will leave you with an unshakeable sense of dread. Na Hong-jin keeps with the traits through and through firstly starting with a scene with Jong and his young daughter and it seems that she has been cured from the almost futile illness which is an odd switch in tone but it's nice to be included, but as the third act continues the thrills and mysterious escalate. Picture a scene: with a beautiful rural family home, and all of a sudden a female ghost dressed entirely in white appears, her talking about your family dying if you go back to them, and then transitioning to one of your colleagues who gets a shock which he will never be able to forget for as long as he lives. Essentially the final act of The Wailing is filled with unencumbered thrills, shocks and terrifying scares which burrow under your skin and never leaves you. Indeed, The Wailing may be a bit long at 2 and a half hours long and has a slightly familiar premise with The Silence of the Lambs as it is filled with thrills, unencumbered shocks and visceral terrifying demonic scares, and by the end this will leave you with a horrible, unshakeable and fundamentally unforgettable sense of demonic dread which you will want to see again and again. It seems that K-horror like The Wailing and Train to Busan is surviving with a trait that Holloywood can never get back again in modern day horrors. VERDICT: Na Hong-jin's horror is a terrifying and unforgettable exercise which burrows under your skin leaving you with a lingering, unshakeable sense of dread that modern Hollywood horrors can rarely seem to muster now-a-days; one of the best ever horrors. 8/10 Terrifying.",8.0,coreyjdenford,2016/11/26,9,3
1957,Pulp Fiction,Awesome!,"I just finished screening this movie for the first time after putting it off for a number of years because of what seemed like equivocating appraisals from some of my friends. In hindsight, however, it seems to me that while the movie must have definitely bowled them over, overall they weren't sure exactly what to make of it or how to articulate what were probably a confused mix of feelings. But I am so impressed that I feel compelled to add a few specific observations to the many fine reviews already on this database. First, this movie hits you with an impact somewhere in between, say, APOCALYPSE NOW and A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, and for some people may be just as disturbing (however, in this respect I am happy to report I didn't think it rose to the level of NATURAL BORN KILLERS). Full of graphically violent action and language, PULP FICTION is not a picture for everyone - I would definitely not recommend it to my parents, born in the 1930's (even to my one fairly ""hip"" relative of the same generation who, at age 66, still teaches high school sex education and likes to talk about things like sunbathing nude, among other potentially sensitive issues). Irrespective of audience sensibilities, however, the film-makers, supported by superb acting in every role, manage to create a world full of the most fascinating sleazy characters possibly ever to appear on screen. From Travolta's pronounced almost-child-like curiosity about the world to Jackson's sincere and thoughtful philosophical ruminating and Willis's deep devotion to the memory of his father, I think such fascination lies not only in the characters' personalities as they are portrayed but in the way they tantalize the viewer into considering the possibility that such people could actually exist. As a lawyer of some years' experience dealing with all sorts of people I was particularly drawn to this aspect of the film. Thus, and in response to some other reviewers' comments, I think this movie is more character-driven than plot-driven. Instead of a story peopled by basically weakly developed characters employed primarily as a mere device to move the plot along, as is too frequently the case in the movies (especially these days), the undeniably strong, clever, and unpredictable plot lines in PULP FICTION are actually of essentially secondary interest and importance, serving primarily as vehicles to get you worried about the fate of characters you can't help caring about despite the truly low attributes that otherwise form the basis for their respective personas. As at least one other reviewer noted, when the film ends you are actually disappointed, left craving more of these crazy people and their explosive lives. Finally, and as strange as it may sound, this film reminds me of another Monumentally Great Film which one would never typically associate with it in any way in a million years - CASABLANCA. As in that film made way back in 1942, and as another reviewer has suggested, perhaps its special appeal - its unusually high degree of emotional impact - lies in its distinctly successful simultaneous application of several different genres in a single film - drama, action, dark humor - with the whole thing bound together by essentially flawless execution in every department. And while CASABLANCA is no doubt clearly much more wholesome and high-minded, like the older film PULP FICTION is not without a pronounced theme of redemption, even if it is not as strongly felt, considering all the later film's sleaze and violence. In sum, when people say that this is probably the best film of the 1990's, it is easy to see why. Fundamentally a truly outstanding movie, it is a must-see for anyone who considers themself a film buff and can handle graphic subject matter. (Incidentally, if you would like a more toned-down, much more overtly humorous and less serious picture with a not-altogether dissimilar look and feel, don't miss another 1990's Travolta picture, GET SHORTY.)",,Gatorman9,2004/04/18,507,277

Dustin Hoffman is just phenomenal and Kate Reid is terrific as well. But why was John Malkovich cast as the elder son, Biff? He's a great actor but he just doesn't fit the part of the athletic, confident 'golden boy' on whom Willy Loman pins his hopes for the future. In fact Malkovich looks rather pale, thin and menacing (especially with that voice!). Still, that strange casting decision doesn't ruin the movie, as Malkovich carries off the part of the fallen son (later in life) very well.

I say with no restraint that this is the starkest picture of our underfunded, largely forgotten, malnourished school system I've ever seen.

1962,Moon,A sci-fi film where it's the acting that counts,"Directed by David Bowie's 38-year-old son (formerly known as Zowie), with a screenplay by Nathan Parker, 'Moon' is a curious and thought-provoking sci-fi story about a man working for an energy company, mining Helium-3 on the far side of the moon, who discovers, just as his three-year contract is ending, that he may not be going home. Sam Rockwell gets to do a virtuoso turn as alternative versions of himself (his character's name is Sam too, Sam Bell). Events are set in a traditional space station with a capacious, softly lit layout featuring the obligatory human-voiced and omnipresent computer -- mobile, not so big, a sort of clunky R2D2 -- creepily accommodating and voiced by an almost-human Kevin Spacey. It's a robot, I guess, and its name is GERTY. There are nice lunar landscapes outside where Sam sometimes rides around in a puffed-up Hummer-style Land Rover to explore or look over the machinery extracting Helium-3. Instead of the now all-too-usual and increasingly irrelevant CGI, there's more the feel of a giant mock-up in everything we see, which provides a better kind of background for what is essentially a Kafkaesque head trip. The interior isn't all modernistic chill. There's also a funky armchair reminiscent of the final sequence of '2001,' and cozy junk, even a college pennant, on the wall around Sam's bunk, sort of like a frat boy's quarters. Sam Rockwell's own appearance, his skin far from perfect and his expression a bit wacko, suggests an ordinary guy, just a worker, which is what he is, not some Astronaut. 'Moon' explores the paranoia we feel about a possible future increasingly dominated by evil, pervasive corporations -- not Big Brother, but Big Corp. It also gets at something hauntingly explored in the movie Jones's dad Bowie played an alien in in way back when, Nicholas Roeg's 'The Man Who Fell to Earth': the terrible loneliness of being out in space away from one's own kind. Sam works on the moon all by himself, and some kind of radio blockage keeps him from being in direct electronic contact with people, including his wife. There's also another aspect of space travel where distances destroy human chronology: a distorted and confused sense of time troubles Sam when he tries to figure out what's been going on with his little family back on earth. It seems like it all happened a longer time ago than he knew. Or did it maybe happen to somebody else? Such questions may arise from time to time in other space movies, but the filmmakers are usually too preoccupied with stuff like conflicts among the crew, threats from hostile invaders, or technical meltdowns to go into the full awful anomie, mega-aloneness and paranoid delusion lengthy sojourns in space are likely to induce. 'Moon,' however, has no other crew members or invaders or technical problems. Everything seems to be operating according to plan; only it's beginning to seem Sam didn't know what the whole plan was, insofar as his future is concerned. When he's out checking on something not far from the module, the vehicle gets into some kind of accident, and when he wakes up, things start to go strangely wrong. This is where the full-on head trip begins, and we, and Sam, start trying to figure out what's going on. That's all I can tell you, because it's essential that the mystery unfold on its own. 'Moon' doesn't dazzle but gives pleasure in its low-keyed conviction. It even made me think of Shane Carruth's 2004 virtually no-budget cult time-travel movie, 'Primer,' because even with relatively elaborate sets and effects, it still focuses on ideas, rather than razzle-dazzle -- on what Sam is going through, rather than what the filmmakers were up to. Hence the key work is done by Rockwell. Sam Bell is exhausted and lonely after three years alone on the moon with only GERTY for company, and Rockwell must go through a series of reawakenings and breakdowns after he hallucinates and has that accident in the vehicle and then becomes increasingly confused, angry, and frantic about what's going on. I'm not sure Jones or Parker make the most of the situation they set up, but Rockwell's quick reactions and mood shifts hold our attention very well. As we know from 'Confessions of a Dangerous Mind,' 'Joshua,' and 'Snow Angels,' Rockwell does great mental breakdowns. This time he does rapid physical deterioration equally well. In a sense, all the most important special effects come out of the actor's bag of tricks. But that's not to forget the satisfying simplicity of the lunar landscape design sculpted by cinematographer Gary Shaw and production designer Tony Noble, or to overlook Clint Mansell's evocative musical soundscape. And when Sam confronts other versions of himself, needless to say the CGI folks were needed to pull it off within single frames. Low keyed and a little slow, 'Moon' isn't for everyone and may seem tailored primarily for sci-fi buffs. But its disturbing exploration of identity goes back to a child's fundamental philosophical speculations: Why am I here? Who am I? How do I know I'm me?",9.0,Chris Knipp,2009/06/22,57,39
1963,Blackfish,It proved its case and provoked change,"""There is no record of an orca doing any harm to a human in the wild."" Despite not being the world's greatest animal lover, I remember being fascinated by the gorgeous killer whale during my childhood. I recall one of the incidents that a trainer had with these animals when I was young, but I thought it was just part of the perks of working with wild animals. Ever since, I believed these were dangerous animals. I also found myself on SeaWorld's side believing that they were offering us an amazing opportunity to see these animals up close, while at the same time domesticating them. I never believed these animals were suffering from captivity or anything of the sort. I was just as blind as the former trainers who are in this wonderful documentary sharing their experiences. Gabriela Cowperthwaite delivers a carefully constructed case in Blackfish by giving evidence that these animals are not only intelligent beings, but highly emotional and social as well. She convinced me with her forensic and detailed evidence that the attacks like the one in SeaWorld weren't simply part of a working hazard, but provoked by the inhumane treatment these orcas receive in captivity. There is no doubt in my mind now that these attacks are a direct result of their captivity. Gabriela sort of ruined my childhood memories, but she accomplishes her purpose and convinced me not to support SeaWorld. Blackfish succeeds in that regard because it accomplished its purpose and was effective in my case. Most of the time documentaries can be interesting although dull, but Blackfish is just as entertaining as it is informative. I was hooked from the very opening scene and I never felt bored during the interviews or the footage. Cowperthwaite's case might be one sided and biased, but it isn't her fault that SeaWorld didn't want to participate in the making of this film. Having these former whale trainers share their experience, while watching their footage with the whales was effective as well. They've all had a change of heart because you can tell they actually love these animals and most of them established an emotional connection with them. I wonder what present day trainers will think of this after watching all the compelling evidence presented here. Not only does Gabriela point out that these animals are highly emotional and social, but she also reminds us that these animals have never attacked anyone in the wild, they live much longer lives in the wild than in captivity, and that it isn't normal that their fins drag to their sides like most of the whales in SeaWorld. The only evidence she introduces which I would debate was when she mentions that Tilikum's (one of Seaworld's biggest whales) offspring could acquire that learned aggression towards humans, but scientists have proved it's not the case. The documentary is very aggressive and it is effective in sending out the message and provoking a reaction in the audience. I will admit that there are also some tearful moments in this documentary as well. Blackfish makes its case and does so effectively.",9.0,estebangonzalez10,2014/11/11,10,9

1965,Taxi Driver,Dreadful crock,"This movie earned rave reviews for one reason only, salacious interest in a twelve year old prostitute. A gratuitous detail, why did she have to be twelve? Travis Bickel played by de Niro elicits no sympathy or credibility at any point. Witness his lame dialogue at chatting up the Cybil Shepard character on the phone. Witness de Niro giving her an LP and admitting that he ""knows nothing"" about music. Witness him telling the politician Palladino that he supports him and hopes that he wins the election, and then telling Palladino that he ""knows nothing"" about politics. There was another instance where the lead character confesses that he ""knows nothing"" about some or other issue that had been explored and then summarily cut off by ""knowing nothing"". Witness the lead character performing the standard and predictable American procedure when a woman states her disinterest in him. The man must grab her by the arm and pull and shove her about. I do not find this (admittedly mild) form of assault to be romantically feasible yet it is standard fare in American movies. Are American women different? Do they change their minds after a little display of childish violence? We also have the great Scorsese attention deficit, lazy sloppy and stupid showing the protagonist cutting off one of the sleeves of his shirt (why?) and in the next shot the sleeve is back. This isn't a goof, it is unforgivably lazy. At this point you realise that this ""masterpiece"" is a piece of junk. At some point we arrive at the point of the movie, the unnecessarily young prostitute. More lazy sloppy work follows. Predictable painfully shallow dialogue. ""why are you doing this?"" etc. Now the pace of the film speeds up because our stupid lazy director is running out of film stock. Now that the director has fulfilled his child sex fantasies he can give us a gratuitous violence and loving pornographic focus on obviously fake blood and gore and the film quickly wraps with an easy implausible ending. Our twelve year old whore has gone back to school??? with parents who can't afford to visit New York and she is apparently happy in the rust belt town of Pittsburgh. Poor and happy in Pittsburgh don't make sense. Her close associates have been violently murdered in front of her and she trots off to school with a bunch of strangers in some godforsaken city? Our hero has casually killed three people using unlicenced firearms, yet he suffers absolutely zero consequences (another American specialty?) save for hero status in the media and (predictable) interest from the Cybil Shepard person. A shallow stupid and unoriginal story. Perfect for short American attention spans, lazy untidy directing and unconvincing portrayals except for the whore and the pimp.

The banter between Sudeikis and Day was irritating, non-stop and actually stressful....not funny by a long shot. It's like someone ran out of dialog to use. Even Aniston wasn't as funny in this one.

1967,The Wailing,"Uneven, Over-sentimental film","This is The Exorcist, Korean Style. If you look at this film, expect an amalgam of different genres - comedy, horror, drama, soap opera melodrama, all, unfortunately, colliding with each other through an ""everything in the kitchen sink"" mashup. The bad: the police. They make the Keystone Cops look like Holmes and Watson. Absolutely ridiculous and spineless, I didn't know if the movie was supposed to be a real horror flick or a tribute to Abbott & Costello Meets the Wolfman. If the police were so terrified of being policemen, maybe they should just hang their hats in a vegetable stall somewhere. The pacing of the movie could use a little tightening up, too. The cheesy acting could also grate on your nerves, too. The cheesy, manipulative soundtrack also cost the movie a star. The good: the special effects. No expense was spared in this department. All the gore looked realistic as well as the zombies themselves. They went out of their way to make those elements believable, and they were. Nice set design, too. Showed a seedy, poor favela-type style of Korea you often never see in pictures. That was a plus. Maybe that over-dramatic acting style is a Korean thing and, therefore, lost on me. Anyway, it is what it is. Recommended? Not really. You've seen most, if not all, of the scenes in this movie somewhere before. You won't miss much here.",6.0,redrobin62-321-207311,2016/11/14,25,12
1968,The Wailing,A Truly Scary Tour De Force,"Gems like these are truly hard to find, and I'm glad we live in an age where we have the opportunity to catch them in specialty cinemas because it would be terrible to see them in the small screen. It's a Korean film, with some terrific acting and some of the best effects I have seen recently, but what elevates the movie to a special level is its theme and its execution. It is based on popular concepts, yet it will keep you guessing until the very end. It's a tale that will teach you, entertain you, and most definitely scary. It's a thriller with plenty of muscle and heart. The waiting takes you on a long and torturous trip through hell, where a father does whatever he has to do to help his town and ultimately, his daughter. It moves fast and doesn't hold back in showing what begins as the work if a maniac, serial killer, and turns into a mysterious murder mystery with supernatural overtones. The film never falters, even with a brief inclusion of zombies, which I figure is part of the writer's desire to be pretty inclusive in matters if the difference manifestations of good and evil. One will never experience anything but a sense of impending threat and doom. Some members in the audience might feel it's too much but it's all justifiable. It runs over 2.5 hours and one leaves the theater wishing there was more to explain. This would devaluate from the experience because one of the film objectives is to make think the audience go back and look at the clues and turning points, to look into one's own sense of values and want to go back to look at some references upon which the script builds. Rum and see it. A classic has been born.",10.0,aharmas,2016/06/05,46,22

I have only seen Richard Gere in one other movie which was ""The Jackal."" I liked his performance in that movie, but even more so in this as the hotshot attorney Marty Vail. I found the character he played charming, at times funny, and overall amazing. Laura Linney as his cold and determined ex-lover prosecutor is likewise great in her role. But the real magic came from Edward Norton. I've only seen Norton in a couple of movies but he always makes something out of his role. He's a genius when it came to his performance in ""Primal Fear"" which was nothing short of Oscar worthy.

1972,Death of a Salesman,"Great characters and acting, but I question this plot line","It's rare when a writer creates characters as real, deep and engaging as Arthur Miller did here. It's sad, I feel, to see him throw a lot of that out the window because he wants a tragic ending more than anything else. I feel Miller does that in ""Death of a Salesman."" In Willie Loman, he creates a very believable character we care about. The portrayal here by Dustin Hoffman is excellent. I will not to spoil the end for anyone who hasn't seen it, but the conclusion is my chief objection. It does not feel believable for the character. It does feel imposed by the author, and it smacks of a young writer wanting to make a name by amping up the drama. History shows he succeeded; unfortunately, for me, somewhere along the line the point of truth is passed. But there is a lot to like here. This production makes the bright red walls of encroaching apartments feel like more claustrophobic weight crushing the Loman family. Kate Reid and Stephen Lang are totally in character as the wife and son. John Malkovich turns in a bravura performance during the scene where Biff catches his father a little too unexpectedly in a Boston hotel room; it's hard to imagine anyone playing the scene more powerfully. At other times, curiously, Malkovich's Biff feels less a part of the family than the other characters. That discovery scene between Biff and Willie is really enough tragedy for any one play; Miller didn't need more.",6.0,danduda1,2013/06/28,3,0
1973,Death of a Salesman,Disturbing and real...,"This film counts as one of those that are uncomfortable, well-acted, and disturbingly real. John Malkovich and Gary Sinise are very real, as well as Dustin Hoffman. It is an initial shock to see him as an aged man. The cinematography is stark and unforgiving. Willy Loman has lived in ineffective and meaningless life. He will die as a salesman, bragging about sales which mean nothing, building up his sons into something they never were. Anyone who has read or seen the play will feel the desperation of Biff, and Happy, young men who witness their father's depression, and cannot alter the outcome. Arthur Miller has touched the reality of American life in the depression. A brilliant playwright, he addresses issue of the family, and struggling economy which today are still avoided. Kurt Vonnegut once wrote that America is a prosperous nation because the poor will never admit they are poor, and therefore the elite classes have had less social responsibility since the Napoleonic era.

1974,Detachment,"Unoriginal, predictable, melodramatic yet dull","Unoriginal, predictable, melodramatic yet dull. Detachment doesn't tackle a new subject. Delinquent kids and teachers' inability to teach or control them has been a theme since the 1950s (Blackboard Jungle anyone?). However, with each of these sorts of movies you hope that there is something new to be added. If there are movies that add to the discussion, Detachment isn't one of them. Rather than try to present solutions, it just shows the problems. You would think Adrien Brody's character represents the solution but his character is too implausible to be true: idealistic and overly goody-two-shoesy. Plus, is he really the solution? (Any more and there'd be spoilers). If anything, the movie is telling us: don't be a teacher and, more broadly, don't have kids. The plot is quite predictable. Some events are signposted far in advance. The plot isn't hard to figure out in advance, especially as you have so much time to work it out, the movie progresses so slowly. Sure, there's heaps of melodrama, people throwing things, kids being all aggro, ridiculous dialogue and sub-plots, but it's fairly empty.

1975,Primal Fear,Murder mystery at it's finest with a classic debut by Norton,"An exemplary example of not only the courtroom drama but the murder mystery thriller sets of sub genres, Gregory Hoblit's 1996 classic Primal Fear is a movie that to this day stands the test of time thanks to an anchoring turn by the once A listing Richard Gere and the firecracker debut by the ever young Edward Norton in his freakishly good role of troubled, murder accused youth Aaron Stampler. In this modern day and age of courtroom/murder mystery thrillers there is a tendency to be either overly simplistic in there set ups or over complicated to the state of losing the plot, but Primal Fear is that rare moulding of everything coming together in not only a surprising way but a believable way. Director Hoblit (who never really went on with the promise he showed here, even when trying to replicate similar results with Fracture a few years back) is in control of the not only the story transpiring but the actors inhabiting their roles. From bit players John Mahoney as slimy government official Shaughnessy, Laura Linney as hardworking lawyer Janet Venable and Gere as justifiably arrogant hot shot lawyer Martin Vail who does believe in the righteousness of innocent until proved guilty, the whole cast really is solidly on song. While all these elements combine to create a memorable movie set up it was in the Oscar nominated turn of young Edward Norton where this film has grown into the revered classic it is. As stuttering choir boy Aaron, Norton wholeheartedly took control of this young man who SPOILER ALERT hides a dark alter ego below the surface who completely masks Aaron's shy and unconfident demeanour. The film's ace up its sleeve is not even revealed until past the half way mark and it's a credit to the confidence of director Hoblit and Norton that the appearance of this alter ego named Roy makes such an impact in severely limited screen time. It's a master class of acting what Norton does and come the much talked about finale there is no question what one has just witnessed is a reveal that absolutely pays off. It was a turn that well and truly deserved it's Oscar nominated recognition and till this day must be one of the most fully formed debuts by a young star in movie history. Primal Fear is a mysterious thriller at its best and a fine example of a cast coming together to create a memorable believable ensemble. In concerns to Norton, this is a fantastic example of an actor that in his career has produced an abundance of stunning turns that in Primal Fear struck gold in arguably his most memorable performance and in a catalogue that includes Fight Club and American History X, that is quite some feat. 4 and a half bloodied pumped up kicks out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out - [URL]",9.0,eddie_baggins,2014/08/18,2,2

Sure Peter is happy with being normal again, but with the crime rate high and Doc Ock on the rampage can he return back to Spider-Man or will the city be doomed.

How anyone can call this a piece of uplifting cinema is beyond me. Okay, Tom Hanks gives a pretty good performance for a one-dimensional do-gooder, but the rest of the film is pantomime of the cheesiest kind, Puss-in-Boots at my local theatre was less predictable. The characters are cliched stereotypes bar none. We have good kindly guy, comedy good guy, insane bad guy, nice but dim black guy (particularly offensive for this millennium) which leads us to a tedious sermon on good v evil of the most simplistic sort . The director is clearly living off his reputation, having directed the excellent 'SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION' and poor old Stephen King must be turning in his bed (hopefully he's recovered now). The best thing about the film is Mr Jangles the comedy reincarnating mouse who makes a glorious reappearance in the final reel with slightly longer fur. The death of Mr Jangles earlier on in the proceedings probably arouses more sympathy from sentimental American audiences than the sight of nasty prisoners frying in 'Old Sparky'.

1978,Blackfish,"""Caged for Fun & Profit!","""Blackfish steers away from the History of so-called aquatic theme parks and centers in on one and only one subject, Killer Whales being taken from our oceans for the amusement of Humans."" There is so much talk about this Feature Documentary Film being one-sided but how can it be biased when the filmmaker deals with the facts in the cases and issues at hand? Seaworld and their current publicly owned Blackstone won't talk. So be it.. so lets look at the tragedies that unfolded and how can we the public, many investors ourselves can remedy this horrific situation. The film details with the use of stock footage, location footage as well as police evidence tape a Killer Whale's psychosis caused by living in completely unnatural conditions for 25 years. I suppose Seaworld has made this animal their pet project feeling that they can tame anything into a performance. The truth is they are guilty of negligence leading to the death of their own employee's whom they title as Trainers. X-Trainers within the film testify to the madness and inadequate training and lack of experience they had prior to diving into tanks filled with Killer Whales. The film is heavy on Testimonials, lots of talking heads that make the story completely and utterly believable. There is no deception other on the part of the Company that continues to hold the rights to the captive Killer Whale. Upsetting is the candid documentation of how these precious mammals are taken from the oceans. The fact is that these folks are not marine research biologists, but hired hands to get their prey. This film has the capability of setting new safeguards into place for the protection of Whales and most importantly new Theme Park laws that protect them from long-term abuse. Blackfish I believe has one goal and that is to help educate and reform animal rights global laws. This is a mighty job for a filmmaker to accomplish but with a wider release it will be seen. I wanted the Filmmaker to go after Seaworld and its investment Company. I wanted her to tell the story of other closed down parks such as Marineland in Florida. I wanted the defense to have their day in court.

That is why I gave the movie a 10 because it is a comedy and comedy is made to make you laugh. It has succeeded in doing that pretty much.

1984,The Chorus,Proof that Music is indeed the most beautiful and universal language ...,"""The Chorus"" has something special that miraculously cuts straight to your heart, whatever it is doesn't belong to our cynical days. But the 'miraculously' word is less a praise than a simple recognition of value. ""Amelie"" for instance, is a far superior film in my opinion because at least, it had the merit to be original, something that cruelly lacks in ""The Chorus"". I almost blame myself for being so familiar with ""Goodbye, Mr. Chips"", ""Blackboard Jungle"", ""To Sir With Love"" or ""Dead Poets Society"", the theme of the schoolteacher struggling with rebellious pupils and then helping them to find a meaning to their lives is so old that I wonder how Christophe Barratier got away with this from the French critics' circle. Roger Ebert was less magnanimous in his review. I reckon Ebert was about to convince me, just before I started to question my criticism. After all, even the most unoriginal plot can make a creative and surprising film. Moreover, Barratier, the director never denied that the film was an adaptation of a forgotten 1945 classic named ""A Cage of Nightingales"", which basically uses the same plot. Christophe Barratier was so touched by the story that he felt it deserved to be known by the 2000's audience. And thankfully, he didn't kill off the charm by setting the film in a more recent context, and consequently being very careful about the use of this or that minority not to inspire the same kind of negative reactions ""Amelie"" faced. ""The Chorus"" is a film set in the France of 1949, a totally different country who was still healing its wounds from WWII. And in the France of 2004, as it often happens in this country so thirsty of intellectual discussions, the film opened the door to an unexpected wave of nostalgia towards these days where discipline and authority was the daily bread of pupils, whose childhood took its full meaning because it was not spoiled yet by technology. Kids had to learn about respect, yes, but they had the freedom to play with what was at their hands without TV, without the Internet. Tougher times but so much more appealing, and maybe that's why parents and kids both loved the film, and why it became a subject of many social debates highlighting the reality that discipline and authority were still relevant today. ""The Chorus"" was a phenomenon, released at a time where the audience was probably tired of having so many French thrillers emulating American films with a certain level of violence and spectacular scenes that didn't fool anyone. It touched a sensitive chord in France, then Europe and even across the Atlantic, because of the universality of its subject. We all had a teacher who inspired us, and the film is a tribute to this optimism that inhabits childhood, this idea that anything is possible, and that it is never too late to find a meaning to your life. Still, the 'miraculously' word is not about the elements I just described, it's something more than that, something transported by a series of unreadable signs translated by the most beautiful and universal human language. That is the real secret of ""The Chorus"": the music. It's so magnificently composed and written that it succeeds precisely where others cinematic elements don't. Indeed, the same story with the same actors, director and characters wouldn't have such a great phenomenon without that music. I can't describe how the melody of ""Look to your Path"" affected me, and the people in the theater. That's the power of the film, as it brilliantly embodies the magical power of Music, this capability to let yourself escape from your condition, and open the windows of your heart to an infinite road made of dreams, projects and inspirations the film is about hope, optimism, life and this is what the music, hence ""The Chorus"" is about. The music works as an antidote to all the cold intellectual approach that would point its finger on the unoriginality of the plot. Yes, we know that Clément Mathieu (Gérard Jugnot), the underdog and not pleasant-looking music teacher will succeed, yes, the way the kids turn from average singers to a talented choir, flirts sometimes with cinematic fantasy. Yes, we know what will happen to Pierre Morhange (Jean-Baptiste Maunier). But it's like the film embodies itself the touching naivety of childhood incarnated by the cute little face of Pépineau when he says he doesn't know any song, with his nose cutely moving. Okay, we wise guys, have seen many films like this, but how about the others, how about kids? Should our cinematic knowledge always undermine our appreciation? Should we always blame a film for being manipulative even if it manipulates us to something undeniably positive? So, I'll give it a 9, not because of the predictability of the plot, but just for some little flaws in the writing that could have been avoided. How couldn't the older Morhange remember the name of the man who changed his life, for the best? Why trying to depict these kids as incarnation of the devils where they are not (after all, Mr. Chips' kids were not all bratty)? Why making such a despicable character out of Rachin, the headmaster, especially after depicting him in a lighter way just before? The movie needed an unlikable bossy civil servant but not an evil man. And last but not least, in the farewell scene, why didn't Mathieu take all the sheets that went sent to him? There are many interrogations left but these ones still bug me whenever I watch ""The Chorus"". Still, it's indeed one of the most memorable films of the 2000's, that anyone from any country would love, English, American, French? Forget about it, the movie speaks the most universal language, I mean it sings it.",9.0,ElMaruecan82,2011/11/12,1,1
1985,Crash,"Insults intelligence and cheapens the message, if there is one.","I saw this ""movie"" partly because of the sheer number of good reviews at Netflix, and from it I leaned a valuable lesson. Not a lesson about ethnic diversity however...the lesson I learned is ""Don't trust reviews"". Yes, racism sucks and people are complicated, but the people who actually need to see this movie are going to be the ones who are the least drawn to it and least affected by it if they DO see it. The only reason that I can think of for the number of good reviews is that it's being reviewed by people who aren't used to thinking, or who've seen their first thought-provoking movie and somehow think that Haggis invented the concept. In fact, he basically made this film, which should be called ""Racism For Dummies"", as emotionally wrenching as possible, seemingly to give people who don't spend a lot of time thinking the impression that they've discovered some fundamental truth that's never been covered in a film before. Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintanence it's not... An after-school special for the unthinking masses, cut into bite-sized overwrought ham-fisted pieces to make it easier to swallow without too much introspection. It's as if they portrayed everyone as being the worst possible extreme, simply to make us happy that we're such good people because we don't identify with the characters. Let's face it people. NOBODY identifies with these characters because they're all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes (or predictably reverse-stereotypes). It's well acted (even if the dialog is atrocious) and cleverly executed, so much that you don't think to ask ""where's the beef?"" until you can tell the film is winding down. The flaming car scene was well executed, like much of the movie, but went nowhere in the end. The messages are very heavy-handed, and from the ""behind the scenes"" blurb, the producers were clearly watching a different movie, because there is very little to laugh about in this movie, even during the intended funny parts. I have to stress that this is NOT entertainment, more like a high school diversity lesson...call it the ""Blood on the Highway"" of racism. They could even show this in high schools if it weren't for the ""side-nude"" shot of Jennifer Esposito. In this film, everyone's a jerk and everyone learns a lesson (except for Michael Pena who gets the best role, but the most predictable storyline). This is a bad film, with bad writing, and good actors....an ugly cartoon crafted by Paul Haggis for people who can't handle anything but the bold strokes in storytelling....a picture painted with crayons. Crash is a depressing little nothing, that provokes emotion, but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things.",1.0,billkwando,2005/10/19,651,395
1986,Primal Fear,A Triumph for Edward Norton,"Not as great a triumph as ""American History - X"", which I would award 10 stars, but still an impressive achievement. Incidentally, I didn't at first realise it was the same actor in both films, not because of a little facial hair on the Neo-Nazi, but because Norton appears to be able to perform highly convincing acts of metamorphosis. This comes in especially handy when playing the alleged schizophrenic in ""Primal Fear"". Nevertheless, Norton's rôles in both films have a lot in common: both characters have had traumatic childhoods, and both kill their enemies in a highly gruesome manner, but neither is an unmitigated monster unworthy of our sympathy. In addition, both are extremely lucid and shrewd. The ""enemy"" in P.F. is an archbishop who is both morally and financially corrupt. He grossly abuses the trust of his adolescent charges in a highly perverted manner, and is no great loss to the world when ritually exterminated. Despite his horrific childhood,the Norton character has no criminal antecedents, and limits himself to this one, arguably justifiable, criminal act. This seemingly highly inferior human being, Aaron, as the Norton character is called, skilfully strings the brilliant but cocksure barrister/attorney as well as the gullible, inexpert psychologist along, until the startling dénouement, when Gere does not for a few seconds realise what has hit him. Thereupon,with the facial expression of a condemned man (very convincingly done), he feels his over-inflated self-confidence irrevocably punctured,and his glorious illusion of getting a victimized and essentially innocent underdog off the hook utterly shattered. I strongly suspect that Aaron's slip of the tongue which let the cat out of the bag - to thoroughly mix my metaphors - was quite intentional. He too wanted an appreciative audience to his dazzling performance, albeit an audience of one man forced to conceal from others what he had just learnt both for reasons of legal ethics and personal embarrassment. However, Aaron was quite safe to show off anyway because of the law of double jeopardy. He had put on a dazzling act that had fooled everybody. Richard Gere gives a consummate performance as an enteprising lawyer, bumptious, but far from obnoxious, greatly enamoured of cash but heart in the right place. Laura Linney seems lacking in charisma, which I suppose is fitting in one who functions as a foil and a scapegoat,except when she provokes Aaron into a fit of ""personality-fission"". Though why she helped out the defence in this way I don't understand, especially as she had already been made the unwilling tool of the defence in the matter of the video-tape. Another thing that puzzles me is the title ""Primal Fear"": what on earth does it mean? The English translation of the Spanish aka would read ""The Two Faces of Truth"", which is quite explicit and appropriate, but does not relate to the American one at all. My apologies for adding to this already oversubscribed entry. I hope I have, at least, introduced a few original ideas.",8.0,bhbutler,2005/09/08,4,4
1987,The Fault in Our Stars,You Ought to Forget about Dying and be Glad You're Living,"This reviews contains LOTS of spoilers, if you are not wanting the movie to be completely given away, please find a different review. Meet Hazel Grace Lancaster, a 17 year old girl with lung cancer. Meet Augustas, Hazel Grace's boyfriend, who also has cancer. The movie isn't exactly slow, it just doesn't pick up until the middle because of the character introductions. When Hazel was diagnosed at the age of thirteen, she was granted one wish, and she used it to go to Disney Land and Epcot Center. Gus, however, saved his wish. Hazel wants to meet the Author of her favourite book, who happens to live in Amsterdam. Well, after a few set backs, Hazel her mom and Gus are on their way to meet this Author. The Author even pays for a very nice dinner date for Hazel and Augustas, where they drink champagne and discuss philosophy. Oh, and fall in love. You see, Hazel is dying and because of this she doesn't want to love anyone extra who will be hurt by her passing. What Gus doesn't tell Hazel, is that he too is dying and that the cancer has spread to the lining of all his major organs, lungs, liver, stomach, etc. then they make out after dinner (or at least mostly do). When they meet the Author he turns out to be a grieving drunk who lost his daughter at the age of eight to leukemia. He tells them about greater and smaller infinities and Swedish Hip Hop. When all dying Hazel wants is the answer to three characters who are left behind when Anna, the main character, dies. Naturally, Hazel and Gus become mad at the Author because they wasted Gus' Wish on the Author and he didn't even grant the Wish: tell them about the characters who were left behind. Disappointed, they tour the Anne Frank house. It has two flights of steep stairs and a ladder, to get to the top, where they lived. Then they return home and resume their everyday lives and continue their fights with cancer. Traditional Romeo and Juliet story: he even dies first. There are a LOT of factual errors, my sister and I finally just started sitting there counting them all. The Anne Frank house has two steep stair cases and a ladder. Hazel is a very stubborn girl, (in the movie Hazel carries her own tank up both flights of stairs and the ladder, with a little assistance from the Author's Assisant), but in all reality Gus should've carried the O2 tank and passed it over Hazel's shoulder up to the Author's assistant and she carried it the other half of the way. Repeating the process for each case. When Gus is diagnosed with the relapse and he becomes so weak that he is in a wheelchair, he should've also been placed on oxygen because by that point the cancer was in his lungs and he was down to less than 30% capacity. And another thing, Hazel has been on oxygen for a number of months (minimally) and has no indignation from the candela pressing on her cheeks, or dryness around her nose and cheeks from the constant air pressure. And lastly, towards the end, where Hazel and Gus are both weak from the cancer taking over their vital organs, they decide to go out to a park not terribly far, but far enough, from Gus' house. And have one last picnic date. Hazel pushes Gus (theoretically she'd be pushed over 240 lbs. and pulling another 25-30 behind her) over uneven ground, and up a small incline. I would be winded and she barely pauses before they start talking and drinking more champagne. It's never said where an 18 year old and a 17 year old precursor a bottle of very nice champagne from. The only redeeming points in the movie are that their older, not your usual 15 year olds. And that they dress up very nicely when doing grown up activities, not overly mature, just enough. And that they actually come across as mature, not whiny little children. They think a lot about death and how their going to die before they can do anything in life. But what is keeping any of us live until we're old? And of us could get in our cars today and die a million different ways. There isn't anything different about living life with a terminal illness and dying anyway. I say enjoy today and live for tomorrow. None of are guaranteed a ripe old age. And you don't want to be remembered as then person who only thought about dying and forgot they're living!",5.0,VilyaLorien,2014/07/30,13,6
1988,Crash,"Pretentious, preachy and intellectually immature","From the stupid ""angelical"" new age soundtrack, to the excess of slow motion and situations ""to make you think"" and ""to make you cry"", this movie is so pretentious, pathetically preachy, and intellectually immature that I don't want to waste my time analyzing it. But just to fill the ten lines required, I would say that in ""Crash"", Paul Haggis, writer and director, teach us about racial misunderstanding and wrong human behaviors based on prejudice. The story is about a multiracial group of extremely stereotypical characters passing each other in the night, to predictably meet later at the end in a melodramatic finale. Only in Hollywood (only in the US) it could have happened that such a mediocre movie gets not only good reviews but even an Oscar for Best Motion Picture of the year. As a person who loves cinema and who specially loves American cinema, I want to say that just the fact that the critics took this movie seriously makes me feel sad.",1.0,chinomovies,2006/03/13,31,20
1989,Moon,"""His"" point of view, a great story","I didn't hear anything about this movie before to see it, neither did I read any critics. I just randomly chose this DVD in my usual store. I was immediately captivated. I liked the contrasts between the environment so sterile and this guy, installing chaos, just by being alive and struggling with isolation and solitude. What a beautiful idea to use Kevin Spacey voice for the computer, not anymore a machine but something rather human in its cold and moderate way. Beyond the ethical question of cloning, the confrontation of a man with himself, ""In camera"", is oppressing first, because of the time difference between them/himself, but it's so much a reflection (!) on individuality and differences as well. At the end there are no clones. I had some good laughs too, as it seems Duncan Jones and Nathan Parker share a good sense of humour. Oh and by the way, we'll have a blue moon soon.

This is entirely my opinion, and clearly mine alone. Nearly everyone loves this film, and they are honest enough to clarify it, but if my review is completely the opposite, I still feel compelled to write.

1993,Pulp Fiction,One of the Best Film's I've Seen In A LONG Time... and still is,"Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction is a terrific film. It also gets better with each viewing, especially if one of those happens to be on a big theatrical screen where all of the BIG compositions get bigger and more detailed. How much else is there to talk about it after all these years? It's filled with dynamite, sudden and always interesting action, great and naturally clever dialogue, and memorable characters. Also, the acting is always something to behold as by turns straightforward, over the top, subtle, and just downright menacing and spot-on. The directing is one of the strongest that we've seen from Tarantino, as he makes his choices in pacing with shots in unconventional ways but never in a way that would be distracting. And writing, already noted, has been copied by many, and only equaled by a select few. The dance sequence. Samuel L. Jackson's superlative monologuing. It has loyalty among low lifes, and many other odd characters that are all bad and not one is a villain or hero. And somehow even after years of parody and terrible rip-offs, it holds its own and- as one can say after seeing it at a midnight screening- holds its audience as much as it had the countless times before they saw it (or if they are, the first time). The first time you're surprised, the second time you look for the clues or other ambiguity, and then the third time you laugh you head off. The fourth time... I'll leave to you.",10.0,Quinoa1984,2000/01/20,694,386
1994,Hotel Transylvania,It had a lot of potential...,"I saw this earlier today, and I was a bit underwhelmed. The film certainly has an interesting premise - it's the relatively unused ""monsters are afraid of humans"" bit we saw in Monsters, Inc., though not handled nearly as well. The film tries to be a comedy, and fails in that regard. There are one or two memorable jokes, but most of the humor is relegated firmly to the ""fart joke"" territory. There's also the mandatory awful musical number at the end which serves no purpose but to remind you that the creators were aiming this at children and only children (I actually got up and left the theater at this point). However, my biggest gripe with the film was the total lack of pacing. Not in the story, but in the animation. Visually, everything just moves way too fast on the screen. The animators seem to have absolutely no sense of timing for comic effect - while you're still trying to work out the previous visual gag, the next one has already come and gone. Maybe you'd have to see it to understand my meaning, but the animation just needs to slow the hell down. That alone might have saved this movie. That said, the film *does* have some redeeming qualities. Most have criticized the story as being too cliché or predictable, and while it was to an extent, it didn't bother me. I found Mavis's character and her relationship with Dracula to be one of the more compelling aspects of the film, and I can't help but feel like they would have ended up with a better movie if they'd focused on this more and left the fart jokes at the door (though admittedly, not one that would appeal to little kids). Unless you're really itching for something new to see, I probably wouldn't spend the money, though I suppose it's also not the *worst* vampire movie coming out this year...",5.0,dense_electric,2012/10/14,9,5
1995,Crash,Disturbing,"I agree with what so many others have said about the shallow and offensive nature of this film's examination of racism. It is baffling to me that so many people seem to have been fooled by its pretentiousness. I want to comment on the Matt Dillon character as an example of what's most infuriating about this movie. Here we have a man who -- contrasted with the film's underlying message that ""we're all a LITTLE racist"" -- effectively rapes a woman in public, cruelly humiliating her husband and deliberately goading him to make a move that, as he well knows, will lead to his arrest or even death. He does all this after pulling the couple over without any legal cause but because, as we come to understand, they are black and wealthy and he is a hurt little boy who is now the police and can therefore do as he pleases. This behavior is not a LITTLE racist. This behavior is evil. It is disturbing to me that this extreme of racism is held up next to another character's behavior -- spouting her paranoid stereotypes about gang violence -- to illustrate that everybody's a LITTLE racist. Later, we're spoon-fed some tripe about Dillon's poor old dad and how black folks drove him into the poor house. Is this supposed to explain, or worse, excuse this behavior? And is Dillon's character meant to redeem himself by committing the utterly unmotivated and unbelievable, laughably coincidental act of saving the woman he sexually assaulted the very night before? Please. The fact that so many people seem to feel some kind of self-congratulatory admiration for this film makes me feel sad about the shallowness of our understanding of racism, and our apparent lack of commitment to condemning and ending it.",1.0,sweeneyle-internet,2005/07/23,472,276
1996,October Sky,Great movie,"Living on a dying Space Coast, this movie is a reminder about the motivation to go into space. The desire to explore.

But Homer, the one kid who used to be the laughing stock redeems himself by bringing a dying town together on one dream, to go into outer space. Sadly I wish it could be the same for the Space Coast. I wish this movie could bring back the inspiration to these people here. But this movie is at my #1 spot. I don't care how epic ""Transformers Dark of the Moon"" was, or how awesome ""Armageddon"" was, October Sky, the movie that's not epic, the movie, that is my all time favorite. It's theme's, it's lesson exceeds all things EPIC and creates another level of EPIC it's self. Even though there isn't meteors or robots or explosions.

Take for instance the several deux ex machina interludes that allow the characters to experience the two extremes over a period of 36 hours in a city of millions. Molest a woman because because you are a racist and then redeem yourself by rescuing her from a burning car because you are human after all. But wait -- maybe we need to throw in a few racists and coincidences into the mix and repeat ad nauseum to beat it into audience's head.

The dialogs where 100% not teenagers, despite the fact that they may be mature because of their life experience... Have you heard a real teenager speaking? The whole movie is so surrealistic that it would be the same if the characters were blue and could fly.
