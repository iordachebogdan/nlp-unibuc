Gyllenhaal has the finesse to turn a womanizing pharmaceutical sales rep from a cliché character into an astute and caring man with actual depth. Anne Hathaway more just likes to prance around naked. Hathaway's Maggie suffers from early-onset Parkinson's disease, and has closed her heart to love. There's not much more to her character probably just because she has the body to shoot sex scenes. \"Love and Other Drugs\" suffers from an inability to turn its dramatic scenes into poignant ones, and the many drug and sex jokes into thoughtful commentary. And most of the minor characters, all played by stellar actors (Hank Azaria, Oliver Platt, etc.), remain in supporting roles without further advancement in who they are. Despite these problems, at its heart it is just a story of boy loves girl and Gyllenhaal and Hathaway portray that beautifully.\nset during the rise of viagra, love and other drugs follows jamie jake gyllenhaal trying to sell drugs and trying to bed women. women are easier. gyllenhaal has the finesse to turn a womanizing pharmaceutical sales rep from a clich character into an astute and caring man with actual depth. anne hathaway more just likes to prance around naked. hathaway's maggie suffers from early-onset parkinson's disease, and has closed her heart to love. there's not much more to her character probably just because she has the body to shoot sex scenes. love and other drugs suffers from an inability to turn its dramatic scenes into poignant ones, and the many drug and sex jokes into thoughtful commentary. and most of the minor characters, all played by stellar actors hank azaria, oliver platt, etc. , remain in supporting roles without further advancement in who they are. despite these problems, at its heart it is just a story of boy loves girl and gyllenhaal and hathaway portray that beautifully.\n['set', 'dure', 'the', 'rise', 'of', 'viagra', ',', 'love', 'and', 'other', 'drug', 'follow', 'jami', 'jake', 'gyllenha', 'tri', 'to', 'sell', 'drug', 'and', 'tri', 'to', 'bed', 'women', '.', 'women', 'are', 'easier', '.', 'gyllenha', 'ha', 'the', 'finess', 'to', 'turn', 'a', 'woman', 'pharmaceut', 'sale', 'rep', 'from', 'a', 'clich', 'charact', 'into', 'an', 'astut', 'and', 'care', 'man', 'with', 'actual', 'depth', '.', 'ann', 'hathaway', 'more', 'just', 'like', 'to', 'pranc', 'around', 'nake', '.', 'hathaway', \"'s\", 'maggi', 'suffer', 'from', 'earli', '-', 'onset', 'parkinson', \"'s\", 'diseas', ',', 'and', 'ha', 'close', 'her', 'heart', 'to', 'love', '.', 'there', \"'s\", 'not', 'much', 'more', 'to', 'her', 'charact', 'probabl', 'just', 'becaus', 'she', 'ha', 'the', 'bodi', 'to', 'shoot', 'sex', 'scene', '.', 'love', 'and', 'other', 'drug', 'suffer', 'from', 'an', 'inabl', 'to', 'turn', 'it', 'dramat', 'scene', 'into', 'poignant', 'one', ',', 'and', 'the', 'mani', 'drug', 'and', 'sex', 'joke', 'into', 'thought', 'commentari', '.', 'and', 'most', 'of', 'the', 'minor', 'charact', ',', 'all', 'play', 'by', 'stellar', 'actor', 'hank', 'azaria', ',', 'oliv', 'platt', ',', 'etc', '.', ',', 'remain', 'in', 'support', 'role', 'without', 'further', 'advanc', 'in', 'who', 'they', 'are', '.', 'despit', 'these', 'problem', ',', 'at', 'it', 'heart', 'it', 'is', 'just', 'a', 'stori', 'of', 'boy', 'love', 'girl', 'and', 'gyllenha', 'and', 'hathaway', 'portray', 'that', 'beauti', '.']\n"

      "ORIGINAL: OK, I'm Gonna start off by saying that this is my first review on the site, because after seeing \"Spider Man 3\" I felt the urge to fully Analise it: Story- 10/10 The Story picks up from where it ended, leading the characters from the first two films onward to realizing their Comic- Book Potential (Especially Spidey Himself- Notice the \"Key-to-the city\" gig when he poses... That's Definitely the Spidey we all know) and placing the new characters in a very fitting way... it all goes as it should considering the story. Characters- 10/10 This is one of the things I liked most about this film- the FANTASTIC characters and how they develop. every character has a story of it's own and all of them are interesting, compelling and exciting in such a way that I have never seen in a Comic- Flick Since \"Batman Begins\". The best were Definitely Flint Marko/Sandman and Eddie Brock Jr./Venom. The first with his sad and Tragic persona and the other with his frustration and thirst for vengeance... both were very vital for this film and came through all the way. Acting- 7/10 This is NOT \"Gone with the Wind\", folks! It's an action/ comics flick so obviously we won't see any Oscar- worthy performances... when Peter started crying on Harry's dead body, THE ENTIRE THEATER BURSTED WITH LAUGHTER!!! However, here once again \"the rescue\" came from the villains: Topher Grace was absolutely Awesome as both Eddie Brock and Venom; he gave a powerful and very believable performance, and Thomas Haden Church did a TERRIFIC job portraying the Sandman (And the funny part is: I don't even like \"Sandman\" OR Thomas Haden Church! how crazy is THAT?) Action sequences- 10/10 Not A LOT of it but when there is some... its just beautiful... every action sequence is better then the previous one, and altogether you get some of the most unforgettable action- sequences both in Spidey history and comic- flicks history.. Humor- 7/10 I can't remember the last time I laughed so hard in an Action- flick... as a matter of fact... I NEVER *EVER* LAUGHD SO HARD IN AN ACTION FLICK BEFORE! this film has parts that are absolutely hilarious, and most of them belongs to J.K Simmons's as J.J Jameson! (also I would like to add: the rumors are true: Bruce Campbell's cameo= PURE GOLD) but one of the main problems is that it didn't know when to stop and I found myself nearly crying when Peter started dance- walking in the streets, hitting on chicks... I just wanted it to stop! and don't even get me started on that Emo- crap!) Visual/ Special Effects- *11*/10 Yeah, you heard me! 11 out of 10!! 11!! 250,000,000 $!!! you can CLEARLY see where all the money went. Visually speaking, this is the best Film of 2007! NO JOKE! and finally... the most important: Staying true to the Comic- book's Spirit- 10/10 I can't even describe it with words... you will understand when you see it, trust me. If you are a true \"Spider Man\" Fan, go see it NOW! I guarantee you will NOT be disappointed.\n",

      "ORIGINAL: I was lucky enough to catch an advance screening of this movie on June 26 in Dallas and let me say that this movie is brilliant. It starts off with fake trailers from the 3 big actors (Stiller, Black and Downey Jr.) and doesn't stop there. The beginning is a tad slow, but once the men get to their \"filming location\" the film picks back up again. The best part of this movie for me, besides the performance of Downey Jr., was the smaller parts contributing to the overall whole of the movie. Danny McBride was hilarious, as was Steve Coogan as first time director Damien. Get ready for multiple cameos in this movie, as there is well over 15 solid ones. The only part I didn't like in this movie was the leader of the gang that captures Ben Stiller, but I quickly got over it and saw the movie as being funnier with him in it. Edgy comedy, mixed with great action and great character development made this movie one of the best comedies I have seen in years and I cannot urge everyone to go see this movie enough. 10/10\n",

      "EXAMPLE 3\n",
      "ORIGINAL: Watching this fantasy of cashing out to live a life of food, wine, sex and sunlit idleness in Provence, you don't suspend disbelief for a minute. Right at the outset we are shown that Russell Crowe's character is exactly what his beloved uncle calls him when he cheats at chess as a boy -- \"a little s**t.\" Now grown up, he enjoys making money by cheating, not so much for the money, though that's nice too, but for the sheer pleasure of dominating others by being smarter, tougher and more ruthless than they are. Since, he's surrounded by agreeably available women in London (the movie tries to make a running joke of flashes and cleavage shots) it is clear that he needn't sleep alone. Nothing Crowe does makes us believe that he is less than perfectly satisfied with the life he leads, or that he would give it up to take up with a Provencal girl and contendedly guzzle home grown wine on the terrace. Nothing convinces that he and she are made for each other, or that she should see him as anything but a good looking rich foreigner who'll be an enjoyable but short-lived roll in the hay. Because Crowe's boss writes him a thumping severance check when he turns down a partnership and leaves the firm, his choice is too easy to be interesting. His buddy the real estate agent has it right. After six months he'll be bored to death, up to his ears in some financial shenanigan, and probably fooling around on his honey just to prove to himself that he can get away with it. The subplot with the American cousin never gets its feet untangled because the conflict between them over who deserves the property and what to do with it isn't fully developed. She's supposed to be smarter, tougher and more knowledgeable about wine than her youth and good looks indicate, but she doesn't get to do very much with those qualities. Crowe's character can't stand losing. It would have deepened him, and explained his change of life, to have this kid see through him, take him on and beat him at his own game. It would have been a more dramatically satisfying romance to have him try to seduce her, fail, and then fall in love and have to win her. The film hints at those possibilities and immediately backs away. There's a lot else wrong with the picture. We never feel that Crowe is actually in serious trouble over the financial maneuver that gets him suspended for a week because he never acts like a man who's job is on the line. There are a number of pointless sexual innuendos involving secondary characters that don't go anywhere except, perhaps, the cutting room floor. The rental car foul up is formulaic, not credible and therefore not funny. The smack at a couple of clueless American tourists with Southern accents is smug, gratuitous and irritating. Albert Finney's role of Bacchus as an English gentleman gone native is written by the numbers and phoned in on screen. The flashback structure allows Scott to pull out of the hat whatever rabbits he needs to keep the plot moving, like Crowe's childhood ability to imitate his uncle's handwriting and his one childhood encounter with the woman he falls in love with. That actress, by the way, is too young for a character whom we learn is about the same age as Crowe. The only really enjoyable performance is Archie Panjabi (who played Parminder Nagra's older sister in Bend It Like Beckham) as Crowe's hip, all knowing secretary. Her work I'd like to see more of. Bottom line is that this is an unsuccessful variant on the formula High Pressure Guy Finds Self And Love In Laid Back Town. Cars and Doc Hollywood did it better. The Luberon region photographs beautifully, but that's it.\n",

      "EXAMPLE 4\n",
      "ORIGINAL: I was not one of those who hated Ang Lee's 2003 portrayal of the Hulk. I did enjoy it to an extent; it was a bit slow-moving and there were some parts that needed some improvement, but it was overall a decent film. I do agree that Louis Letterier's 2008 film was a vast improvement, though. It improved on all of the issues I had with Lee's film. The film is a reboot of the dying franchise: Bruce Banner has been hiding in Brazil, attempting to keep a low profile while he searches for a cure for his condition, but General Ross becomes aware of his location and enlists the aid of Emil Blonsky, a soldier with a mean streak. A bit of non-sanctioned experimentation later and Blonsky becomes a creature rivaling even the Hulk in power. One issue I had with Lee's 2003 film was the slow-pacing; the film felt as if it dragged forever between action scenes. It wasn't necessarily the fault of the cast, but seemed more to do with a story that didn't really grab me. Letterier's film amps up the excitement and interest levels a bit with a stronger story and better action sequences. The Hulk's fight against three gamma-irradiated dogs in the previous film doesn't even compare to the Hulk's battle against the Army on the college campus in this film. I didn't see the Hulk from 2003 as being overly-cartoonish in appearance but I can see how some others did. The new film gives the Hulk a grittier, stronger, more realistic style (as realistic as a 9-foot tall green giant can be) and the Abomination looks just as good. In general, I also dug the new cast better than the previous. Ed Norton was great as Bruce Banner, giving him a great blend of meekness and inner strength. From what I understand, Norton is a huge fan of the source material so you know he must've given this role everything he had. I enjoyed Liv Tyler as Betty Ross, though there were times when I missed Jennifer Connelly, and Tim Roth has long been one of my favorite actors so it was great to see him go with the villainous side this time around as Blonsky. William Hurt was a fine General Ross though, just as Liv Tyler, there were times when I thought Sam Elliot would've put in a stronger performance (plus, there were a handful of instances where Hurt came off as over-acting a bit, in my opinion...). It's great to have the character of the Hulk back in the hands of Marvel and they've done a great job of rejuvenating the franchise. I loved this film and, while it wasn't on par with 2008's Iron Man film, it was a great superhero flick. The action was brutal, the story was entertaining, and the cast was near perfect. My only real issue with the film was the ending; without going into detail, I thought the resolution of the final battle between the Hulk and Abomination was anti-climactic. I remember first watching the scene and the only thought that popped into my head was \"That's IT?!\". Otherwise, it's a great movie and a good way to spend two hours.\n",

      "ORIGINAL: Guess I should've read more reviews before wasting my money on buy this movie. During the entire movie I just was more and more disappointed as it went on. When I first heard they were making this book into a movie, I went out and bought all three books (mainly because after purchasing the first one, I had to read the other two asap). Didn't take me long to read through them. I couldn't wait to see it at home. Granted directors ALWAYS change something when going from book to the big screen, but I figured it would just be a few small things. Nope..I was wrong. Hardly anything in this movie matched with the books. When I heard Tim Burton was directing this I really thought they had found the right director right off the bat to do the book justice. The author can say what he wants, in my opinion Tim Burton slapped him in the face with this one. This movie could've been SOO much better. It could have gone on to make way more money. If done right (for example splitting the movies up into at least three movies like everyone else) it would've been a way bigger hit. Big names, great acting, great effects, great potential..Tim Burton did not do this one justice at all though. Instead, in my opinion, he ruined it. Maybe in time someone will try and remake this movie...feel free to use the same actors..just go along with the book because the book really is great all on its own.\n",

      "ORIGINAL: My father received movie passes from his work or something for an exclusive premiere of this movie and we just got back from it about 2 hours ago. Wow. If you've seen the previews and trailers for this movie, you'd think that this will be a cool cat-and-mouse thriller. And surprisingly, it really is. Fracture is the twisting story about a young attorney named Willy Beachum(played by Ryan Gosling) in the fast lane to success. Willy is brought into a case where a man named Ted Crawford attempted to murder his wife(Embeth Davidtz) after discovering that she had been cheating on him with the cop that had actually arrested Crawford for the attempt. This Crawford guy is pretty sick and demented, but very clever, and really knows all the rules to play a creepy mind game. When Beachum can not find any evidence proving Crawford is guilty, everything turns into an all-out psychological fight for proof. Cleverly titled Fracture, referring to a break or breaking point, Crawford tells Beachum that he will find Beachums weak spot, and will break him down. Ryan Gosling. What a year for him- nominated for his first Academy Award for his powerful role in Half Nelson (which was excellent- go see that too) and now puts on another pitch perfect performance in Fracture. I don't think this performance will go unnoticed, and he really proved himself as one of the best actors in his generation. Amazing. And what about Anthony Hopkins? He was nothing less than excellent for his role as the psychotic Teddy Crawford. I think that there will be no fans of Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal disappointed by his performance. Very creepy. Not only is this film packed with drama, excitement, and suspense, it is also dusted with just enough humor to make it one of the most supremely entertaining movies of the year. Hopkins' quick wit and Gosling's humor jump off screen and brings the whole audience to many laughs. All around, Fracture is a superior psychological thriller that keeps you guessing. I loved it, and I'm sure millions more will too. *p.s.- about an hour and a half into the movie, watch David Strathairn's character when he goes to Beachum's house. His car is parked in one direction, and then when he goes back to it, it's in a completely different direction. i just thought i'd throw in that goof. =]*\n",
